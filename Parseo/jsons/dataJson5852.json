        "DATELINE": "    OSLO, March 17 - ",
        "BODY": "Norway's parliament has approved an\nextensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a\nkey loophole through which controversial oil shipments on\nNorwegian tankers may continue, government officials said.\n    The unilateral boycott gives domestic companies until late\nSeptember to cut trade ties with South Africa and Namibia.\n    Although forbidding crude oil shipments to South Africa on\nNorwegian-owned tankers, the boycott makes a crucial exception\nfor ships whose final destination is decided while at sea. As\noil cargoes are often resold after loading, critics said the\ndoor will be left open for continued shipments to South Africa.\n    Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct\nof its crude oil imports during the early 1980s, but the trade\nhas dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months,\ntrade ministry officials said.\n    The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South\nAfrica dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight\nmonths of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns\nfrom the year-ago figure.\n    The boycott legislation now goes to the upper house for\nformal ratification later this week, parliamentarians said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
