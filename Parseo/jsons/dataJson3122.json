        "BODY": "Barclays Bank Plc <BCS.L> and Midland\nBank Plc <MDBL.L> said they are cutting their base lending\nrates to 10.5 pct from 11 pct. The cuts follow a similar move\nby National Westminster Bank Plc <NWBL.L>\n    The rate changes take effect tomorrow.\n    The base rate reductions came after the Bank of England cut\nits dealing rates this morning in a signal to the money markets\nthat it would not resist a half percentage point drop in bank\nbase lending rates, market sources said.\n    Until the end of last week, the central was holding out\nstaunchly against market pressures for lower rates in an\napparent effort to preserve the expected rate cuts for around\nthe time of the government's annual Budget on March 17.\n    Sterling remained firm around 1.59 dlrs compared with its\nclose here on Friday at 1.5865 dlrs.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
