        "BODY": "China's textile exports in the first\nquarter reached a record 2.2 billion dlrs, an increase of 49\npct on the year-earlier period, the People's Daily said.\n    Its overseas edition gave no country breakdown. The U.S. Is\none of China's largest markets for textiles.\n    U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige told a press\nconference that Chinese textile and apparel exports to the U.S.\nIn 1986 rose 65 pct in value from the 1985 level, a rate of\ngrowth that \"is not sustainable nor equitable to our other major\nforeign suppliers.\" China is now the United States' largest\ntextile supplier, he said.\n    Baldrige declined to say what would be an acceptable growth\nrate for Chinese textile exports. Negotiations on the next\nChina-U.S. Textile agreement are due to begin in May, he said.\n    \"There clearly has to be a limit,\" he said. \"Our economy can\nonly absorb so much textiles. It is in both of our interests to\nreach a satisfactory conclusion. Without an agreement, we would\nhave a chaotic situation.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
