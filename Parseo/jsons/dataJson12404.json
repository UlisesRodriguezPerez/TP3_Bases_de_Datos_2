        "BODY": "An international protocol to severely\nlimit the use of industrial chemicals which are believed to\ndamage the earth's protective ozone layer could be signed this\nyear, officials and scientists here said.\n    \"By the end of this year, we should have an international\nprotocol in place we can all be proud of,\" U.S. Environmental\nprotection agency officer Bill Long told reporters.\n    The chemicals are chiefly chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which\nare used in refrigeration and making foam plastics, solvents\nand aerosols. The earth's upper ozone layer absorbs most of the\nharmful ultraviolet rays from the sun.\n    The officials and scientists were meeting in Tokyo, ahead\nof an international conference on the problem later this month\nin either Vienna, or Geneva, Long said.\n    Robert Watson, a program manager for atmospheric problems\nat the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration said\na protocol should demand an initial freeze on the use of CFCs\nby industry. This should be followed by a gradual reduction in\nCFC volume until no CFC gases are released into the air, he\nsaid. The U.S. Has already banned use of use CFCs in aerosols\nand Japan has asked for voluntary restraint, but both still use\nCFCs in industrial processes.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
