        "BODY": "Venezuela will lend Ecuador up to 12.5\nmln barrels of crude oil to help it meet its export commitments\nand its domestic energy demand, Ecuadorean Energy and Mines\nMinister Javier Espinosa said today in a statement.\n    Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline\nconnecting its jungle oil fields with the Pacific Ocean port of\nBalao was damaged last week by an earthquake.\n    Venezuela would lend 50,000 barrels per day of crude for a\ntotal of up to to 7.5 mln barrels to help Ecuador meet export\ncommitments, Espinosa said. Also, Venezuela will sell the crude\nand provide the foreign exchange earnings to Ecuador, he said.\n     Ecuador would repay Venezuela in crude once it resumed its\nexports after repairing its pipeline to Balao, a task that\nwould take an estimated five  months.\n    Venezuela is lending Ecuador five mln barrels of crude for\nrefining in this country to meet domestic demand. Ecuador would\nrepay that loan with crude once the oil pipeline is repaired.\n    Both countries are the only Latin American members of the\nOrganisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n    Ecuador was exporting about 140,000 bpd before the\nearthquake, Energy Ministry officials said. Its total output\nwas around 260,000 bpd.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
