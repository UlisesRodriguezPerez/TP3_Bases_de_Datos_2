        "TITLE": "U.K. EXPORTS BODY GETS NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR",
        "DATELINE": "    London, March 3 - ",
        "BODY": "Export Credits Guarantee Department has\nnamed Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay's\nBank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17\nyears, to the post of executive director, a department\nspokesman said.\n    Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57.\n    A drop in the ECGD's business volume and a rise in its debt\nto the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recent\nyears.\n    Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top\nconvern, adding that the department may have to compete more\naggressively with private insurance firms providing similar\nservices.\n    The department's annual report for the year ended March 31,\n1986, showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7\nbillion stg from 17.4 billion the year before, while its debt\nto the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg.\n    Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But among\nhis chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser\ndeveloped countries and their ability to pay for their imports.\n    The agency will have to review its policies on insuring\nexport credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis,\nhe said. \"Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of\nthing we want to take a look at.\"\n    \"You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in\na peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing,\"\nStephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will\nstrike more countries from its list of political risk insurance\nrecipients.\n    He noted that certain countries have already been removed\nfrom the list.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
