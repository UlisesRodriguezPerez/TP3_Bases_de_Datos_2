        "BODY": "KLM Royal Dutch Airways <KLM.AS> said\nit agreed to take full control of a partially owned Dutch-based\nparcel delivery service and will offer a minority stake in it\nto British and Commonwealth Shipping Plc <BCOM.L>\n    KLM, seeking to strengthen its market position in the fast\ngrowing door-to-door delivery market, said it agreed with Dutch\nretailer Vendex International <VENN.AS> to take over Vendex's\n50-pct in their jointly-owned courier, <XP System VOF>.\n    Ownership of XP will now be brought into the talks started\nby KLM last week with British and Commonwealth for a one-third\nstake in the latter's <IML Air Services Group Ltd> courier.\n    When announcing the negotiations with British and\nCommonwealth last week, KLM said buying a minority stake in IML\ncould involve a convertible loan issue.\n    A KLM spokeswoman said the Dutch flag carrier would now\noffer a minority stake in XP to British and Commonwealth in the\nnegotiations on IML, but declined to elaborate on financial\naspects of the talks.\n    She said KLM would like the two courier services to\ncooperate in future and did not exclude a future merger between\nthem to combine IML's strong world-wide network with XP's\nmainly European activities.\n    XP System is based in the southern Dutch airport of\nMaastricht and has an annual turnover of 100 mln guilders.\n    KLM, which is also negotiating with British and\nCommonwealth for a 15-pct stake in the latter's regional\nairline <Air U.K. Ltd>, says door-to-door delivery courier\nservices are seeing substantially faster growth than\ntraditional cargo activities.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
