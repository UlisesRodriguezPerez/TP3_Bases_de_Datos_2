        "BODY": "U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard\nLyng said it is too late to implement a full 0/92 acreage\nprovision, or \"decoupling,\" for 1987 grain crops.\n    \"I think there's a chance we'll see that legislation (0/92)\npassed, (but) not for 1987 crops. It's too late,\" Lyng told the\nNational Grain and Feed Association convention here.\n    Lyng added that there seems some support in Congress for\n0/92 and there was a good chance a pilot 0/92 program will be\npassed as part of a pending disaster bill.\n    But he indicated that it is already too late in the year to\nalter the 1987 crop program. Sign-up for spring crops closes\nthe end of this month.\n    Overall, Lyng predicted very little change will be\nlegislated in the 1985 farm bill this year.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
