        "BODY": "Belgian Budget Minister Guy\nVerhofstadt has proposed a plan to sell off shares in several\nstate-owned enterprises, including national airline Sabena and\nthe postal and telecommunications authority, government sources\nsaid.\n    They said the plan could raise more than 25 billion francs\nin revenue over the next five years according to Verhofstadt's\nprojections, helping the government to reduce its huge budget\ndeficit, targetted this year at 418 billion francs.\n    But the scheme had received a guarded reception from the\nSocial Christian parties in Belgium's centre-right coalition\nwhen Verhofstadt unveiled it at a cabinet meeting yesterday.\n    Discussion of the plan was likely to be long and difficult,\nthe sources said.\n    Verhofstadt proposes beginning the selloffs in the last\nquarter of 1987, with the sale of 30 to 40 pct of state\ninvestment company SNI. He expects the sale to raise three\nbillion francs, they added.\n    A 25 pct share in Sabena would be sold in mid-1989 for 1.5\nbillion francs, while 50 pct of the postal and\ntelecommunications authority would be sold off in two stages in\nmid-1990 and early 1992, raising at least seven billion francs.\n    Also on Verhofstadt's list are the Maritime Transport\nAuthority, leading gas distributor Distrigaz, CGER savings\nbank, CGER, and several other credit institutions.\n    Le Soir daily quoted CGER vice-president Paul Henrion as\nexpressing strong opposition to the privatisation of his bank.\n    \"Public company we are and public company we wish to stay,\"\nHenrion told the paper.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
