        "BODY": "New York cocoa traders reacted with\ncaution to today's developments at the International Cocoa\nOrganization talks in London, saying there is still time for\nnegotiations to break down.\n    \"I would be extremely cautious to go either long or short\nat this point,\" said Jack Ward, president of the cocoa trading\nfirm Barretto Peat. \"If and when a final position comes out (of\nthe ICCO talks) one will still have time to put on positions.\nThe risk at the moment is not commensurate with the possible\ngain.\"\n    ICCO producer and consumer delegates this morning accepted\nthe outlines of a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules as\na basis for further negotiation. A smaller group of\nrepresentatives is now charged with fleshing out the details.\n    \"Market sentiment has reflected optimism, I would't put it\nany stronger than that,\" Ward said.\n    \"It seems to put them slightly closer to an agreement...\nbut one shouldn't forget how much they have to negotiate,\" said\nanother trader of today's developments.\n    Many dealers were sidelined coming into the negotiations\nand have remained so, traders said.\n    \"The dealers have got historically small positions in\noutright terms,\" one trader said.\n    Speculators have gone net long \"but only slightly so,\" he\nadded.\n    The recent price strength -- gains of about 52 dlrs the\nlast two days -- has been due in large part to sterling's rally\nagainst the dollar and in the process has attracted a measure\nof origin selling, traders said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
