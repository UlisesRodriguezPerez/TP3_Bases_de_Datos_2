        "DATELINE": "    MADRID, April 9 - ",
        "BODY": "The head of Spain's employers'\nfederation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worried\nabout the government's monetary policies because high real\ninterest rates were hampering investment.\n    He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this\nyear were not endangering the government's five pct inflation\ntarget. The government's perceived need to control inflation by\nkeeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.\n    High real interest rates were attracting an influx of\nspeculative foreign capital which was undercutting the\ngovernment's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.\n    Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,\nliquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17\npct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a\ntarget range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.\n    To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money\nrate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from\n11.8 at end-1986.\n    Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to\nhold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,\nwith increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new\nwage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.\n    These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish\nworkers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.\n    He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the\nstate sector, where the government is trying to impose its five\npct wage ceiling.\n    Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in\nSpain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first\ntwo months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct\nincrease over the corresponding period last year.\n    However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the\npeseta to correct the imbalance.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
