        "BODY": "The U.S. Agriculture Department said\nan announcement by the department yesterday concerning 15.0 mln\ndlrs in additional credit guarantees for exports of U.S.\ncommodities to Turkey contained two inaccuracies.\n    First, the USDA said its announcement should not have said\nthat plywood was excluded from the additional three mln dlrs in\nGSM-102 credit guarantees for lumber.\n    The original announcement said the guarantees included\nthree mln dlrs for lumber, except plywood.\n    Melvin Sims, USDA general sales manager, told Reuters he\ndid not anticipate any plywood would be included in the sales,\nbut that \"it's possible it would be.\"\n    Plywood in the past has not been eligible for GSM-102\ncredit guarantees because it is considered by some to be a\nmanufactured product. Members states of the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development have pledged not to offer\nconcessional credits on manufactured products, Sims said.\n    However, the Reagan administration is considering whether\nto allow plywood sales to be covered by the credit guarantee\nprogram, Sims said.\n    Second, the USDA announcement said 6.0 mln dlrs of a\npreviously announced 6.0-mln dlr line for tallow under GSM-102\nwas available for both public and private sector importers.\n    In fact, the line of credit guarantees for tallow is\navailable only for public sector importers, Walter Stern,\nForeign Agricultural Service Turkey analyst, said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
