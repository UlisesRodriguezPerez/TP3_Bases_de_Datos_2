        "TITLE": "PESCH SEES SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT IN AMI <AMI> BID",
        "AUTHOR": "    By Patti Domm, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    New york, March 2 - ",
        "BODY": "Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch said he\nhas had discussions with several American Medical International\nInc shareholders and sees support for a restructuring of the\ncompany.\n    Pesch said he has discussed his sweetened, 1.91 billion dlr\ntakeover bid for American Medical with several large\nshareholders, including the biggest investor, the Bass family\nof Texas. However, the Bass family has not indicated support\none way or the other for his offer, he said.\n    Pesch, in an interview with Reuters, said based on the\nconversations he held with shareholders, he could not guage\nwhether he had majority support. He said, however, there is\nsupport for his offer.\n    Pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he held\ndiscussions other than the Bass family and the Wedge Group Inc,\nthe only other holder of more than five pct of American Medical\nstock.\n    Earlier today, Wedge Group, which has a 5.5 pct stake, \nsaid it held discussions with Pesch, American Medical\nmanagement and other American Medical shareholders.\n    Wedge, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, said it believes a restructuring of American\nMedical and its business would be \"highly desirable and\nappropriate at this time.\"\n    \"That's the sort of position that I find a large segment of\nshareholders of AMI really share,\" said Pesch.\n    Pesch said he held discussions with Wedge about joining his\ntakeover effort, in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash, four\ndlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for each\nAmerican Medical share. Wedge said it has no plans to join in\nan effort to seek control of American Medical, but it would not\nrule out a future takeover try.\n    Pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposal\nwith the Bass family.\n    Some analysts saw the Wedge statement as a boost to Pesch's\ntakeover effort and a further sign that there could be some\nshareholder dissatisfaction following American Medical's\nprevious rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer from\nPesch.\n    American Medical is expected to resist Pesch's latest bid.\nLarry Feinberg, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said a\nmanagement-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out.\n    An American Medical spokesman said the company will comment\non the new Pesch offer by March 10.\n    Analysts continue to view the Bass family as a factor in\nthe outcome of the bid for control of American Medical.\n    The Bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in American\nMedical, and the company has previously said the investors\nsupport management's internal plan to improve the company's\nperformance. The Bass family would not comment on American\nMedical or Pesch.\n    Pesch, who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp\nlast year, continues to face a credibilty problem on Wall\nStreet because of the long time it took to finish the Republic\nacquisition.\n    Republic also has substantial debt, and has left wall\nstreet questioning whether financing can be completed for the\nmuch larger American Medical takeover proposal.\n    Pesch's first offer for American Medical was made without\nan investment banking firm, another cause for concern to Wall\nStreet. However, Pesch entered his second offer with\nrepresentation from Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette Securities\nand Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group.\n    \"I don't have any doubt that the current transaction can be\nworked out and completed, provided we get to the point where\nAmi management will sit down and talk in a friendly\nenvironment,\" Pesch said.\n    Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing\narrangements are being made. He did say if he succeeds in\nacquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of American\nMedical management in place.\n    He said he plans to combine the company with Republic to\nform an efficient network of hospitals.\n    Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could\nbe made for American Medical.\n    Byron Nimocks of E.F. Hutton Group said improved second\nfiscal quarter earnings could make American Medical stock worth\nabout 20 dlrs per share.\n    Nimocks estimates American Medical earnings for the second\nquarter ended February 28 could be 35 cts, compared to a 95 ct\nloss last year.\n    Nimocks said Pesch's revised offer is not worth much more\nthan the 20 dlrs cash offered previously.\n    But Feinberg said there is a better chance a transaction\ncould be completed because of the revised structure of the\noffer. \"I think it's much more doable,\" he said.\n    Analysts have said American Medical has begun a turnaround\nby replacing some members of management and reducing costs.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
