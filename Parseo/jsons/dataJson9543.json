        "DATELINE": "    MONTREAL, March 25 - ",
        "BODY": "<John Labatt Ltd> anticipates a good\nfourth quarter and a new peak in sales and earnings for the\nfiscal year ending April 30, president Peter Widdrington told\nfinancial analysts.\n    He would not make any specific forecast, but said he was\noptimistic for further growth in fiscal 1988 in the company's\nbrewing and food products operations.\n    Labatt's earnings rose to 92.8 mln dlrs in the nine months\nended January 31 from year-earlier 78 mln dlrs. Revenue for the\nnine months rose to 3.20 billion dlrs from 2.70 billion dlrs.\n    Widdrington said Labatt's three-year business plan, now\nbeing updated, targets total sales of about six billion dlrs,\nincluding 2.50 billion dlrs in the U.S.\n    Labatt, Canada's leading brewer, has expanded in the U.S.\nfood products industry by acquisitions.\n    Widdrington said Labatt's strategy for U.S. expansion\nstemmed partly from its strong market position in the Canadian\nfood and beverage industry. The U.S. share of revenues for this\nyear will be about 35 pct, rising to 40 pct in fiscal 1988, he\nsaid.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
