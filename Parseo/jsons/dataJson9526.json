        "BODY": "Cyclops Corp said the three\nmembers of its board appointed last week by <Dixons Group PLC>\nhad resigned and that it named three Cyclops executives to\nreplace them.\n    Cyclops said the moves followed the announcement earlier\ntoday by Dixons that it received only 20 pct of Cyclops\noutstanding common stock under an extended tender offer that\nexpired yesterday.\n    Dixons initially ended its 90.25 dlr a share tender offer\non March 17 after receiving 54 pct of Cyclops shares.\n    However, the Securities and Exchange Commission last Friday\npressed Dixons to reopen the offer because the U.K.-based\ncompany had dropped a condition that at least 80 pct of Cyclops\nstock be tendered by the close of the offer.\n    Dixons then extended the offer until yesterday and earlier\ntoday indicated that a substantial number of tendered Cyclops\nshares had been withdrawn, leaving it with only 852,000 shares,\nor just over 20 pct of the roughly 4.26 mln Cyclops shares\noutstanding.\n    Dixons said today that it purchased the tendered shares,\nwhich, when combined with the shares it already holds, gives it\na 21.7 pct stake in Cyclops.\n    Cyclops said its reconstituted board includes the three\nnewly named directors and five outside directors, all of whom\nwere on the board prior to Dixons tender offer.\n    The three Cyclops directors were replaced by Dixons\nappointees on March 17 under an agreement reached between the\ntwo companies.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
