Sosnoff did not detail the value of\nthe proposed compensation.\n    Also suggested was a deal involving \"put\" and \"call\" option\nregarding Sosnoff's Caesars World holdings, he said.\n    The proposed deals would have also included a \"standstill\"\nagreement, which would have restricted Sosnoff's right to buy\nmore Caesars World stock or \"to take any action adverse to\nincumbent management,\" he said.\n    Sosnoff's report on the offers he received for his Caesars\nWorld shares were amended to his official offer to purchase the\ncompany, as well as reported to the SEC.\n    Sosnoff now holds about 4.1 mln Caesars World shares, or\n13.6 pct of the company's 30 mln shares outstanding.\n    The Sosnoff offer to buy the shares of the company he does\nnot already hold has been valued at 725.2 mln dlrs.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
