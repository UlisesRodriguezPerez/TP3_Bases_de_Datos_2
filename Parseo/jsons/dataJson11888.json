        "BODY": "Investor Martin T. Sosnoff said\nSouthmark Corp and affiliate Pratt Hotels Corp have ended talks\nwith his MTS Acquisition Corp on a possible joint venture for\nthe acquisition of Caesars World Inc.\n    Sosnoff said the talks had not been actively pursued since\nthey were announced March 20, but it had been agreed that\nunless the discussions were formally terminated, Pratt and\nSouthmark would not initiate a competing tender offer for\nCaesars World or take any other action that would hamper\nSosnoff's current offer to acquire all Caesars shares he does\nnot now own for 28 dlrs each.\n    Sosnoff said his 28 dlr per share bid for Caesars, which is\nscheduled to expire May 15, still stands, and he remains\nreceptive to negotiating a transaction to buy Caesars on\nfriendly terms.\n    Pratt recently made an apparently unsuccessful bid to\nacquire control of Resorts International Inc <RTB>, seeming to\nlose out to Donald Trump.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
