        "BODY": "The United States may lift an\nadditional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan later\nthis month, Reagan Administration officials said.\n    President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on\nJapanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986\nagreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and third\ncountry markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods.\n    The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on\nJapanese color television sets, hand-held power tools and\nportable computers.\n    Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  after\nJapan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market at\nbelow production costs.\n    Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory\nand recall purposes in a wide variety of computers.\n    The Administration officials said Commerce Department \nmonitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the\nsemiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking\nsales away from American-made semiconductors.\n    They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would\nbe lifted by the end of the month.\n    The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the\nclosed Japanese markets to U.S. goods.\n    U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliance\nwith the agreement earlier this week.\n    The periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining\nsanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until Japan is\nin full compliance with the semiconductor agreement.\n reuter\n\u0003"
