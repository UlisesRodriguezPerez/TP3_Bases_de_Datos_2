        "BODY": "Finance Minister Michael Wilson said\nlarge inflows of capital into Canada, principally into the\ncountry's bond market, is a major reason behind the sharp\nrecovery in the Canadian dollar.\n    He said the inflow of funds, mainly from Japan, Europe and\nthe United States, is the result of \"confidence in the\ndirection this country is going in.\"\n    \"That is the reason why the (Canadian) dollar today is\nhigher than 75 cts (U.S.) compared to this time last year (when\nit was) a little over 69 cts,\" Wilson told the House of Commons\ndaily question period.\n    Figures released this week show foreigners purchased a\nrecord 23.1 billion dlrs of Canadian bonds in 1986, more than\ndouble the previous year, with Japan investing a record 9.5\nbillion dlrs in the market.\n    Wilson was responding to opposition party questions about a\npossible loss of jobs from the rise in Canadian investment\nabroad. Canadian investment, including the buying of foreign\ncompanies, stocks and bonds, rose to 12.53 billion dlrs from\n6.19 billion dlrs in 1985.\n    The minister said the flow of funds from abroad would\ngenerate many new jobs in Canada.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
