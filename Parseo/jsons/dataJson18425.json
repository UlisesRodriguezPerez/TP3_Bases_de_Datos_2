        "BODY": "Treasurer Paul Keating said he now\nexpected the Australian current account deficit for fiscal\n1986/87 ending June 30 to come in around 13.25 billion dlrs.\n    In a statement released after Statistics Bureau figures\nshowed the May deficit was below forecasts at 866 mln dlrs,\nKeating said the cumulative deficit is now likely to be about\n1.5 billion dlrs below the Treasury forecast of 14.75 billion\nissued with the 1986/87 Budget papers last August.\n    However, the government had subsequently revised the\nforecast to around 13.75 billion dlrs after a series of current\naccount figures indicated a declining trend.\n    Keating's revised 1986/87 current account deficit forecast\ncompares with a record shortfall of 14.40 billion dlrs in\n1985/86, a level nearly double the 7.29 billion deficit\nrecorded only two years earlier in 1983/84.\n    Keating said the main reason for his revision was a\nbetter-than-expected export performance. Recent quarterly\nfigures showed export volumes rose 14.4 pct in the half-year to\nMarch 30 while import volumes rose only 0.9 pct, he said.\n    The Bureau data issued today showed the cumulative deficit\nfor the first 11 months of 1986/87 narrowed to 12.32 billion\ndlrs from 13.21 billion a year earlier.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
