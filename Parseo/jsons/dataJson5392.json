        "BODY": "A new method of calculating Sweden's\nunemployment figures reduced the number of jobless by a sixth,\na spokesman for the Central Bureau of Statistics (SCB) said,\nreporting a substantial drop in the past year.\n    According to the revised data there were 94,000 jobless in\nFebruary representing 2.2 pct of the workforce against 120,000\nor 2.8 pct of the workforce in February 1986.\n    SCB official Olle Wessberg said the new figures were based\non a more extensive survey of the unemployed which brought\nSweden into line with the practises recommended by the\nGeneva-based International Labour Organisation.\n    Wessberg said the new method cut the number of unemployed\nby about 16 pct. \"The way we are now collecting data is far more\naccurate and we are asking many more questions to find out\nwhether the jobless want work, whether they are able to work\nand whether they have actually looked for work,\" he told\nReuters.\n    The new method was first used for the January figures,\nwhich showed unemployment dropping to 2.1 pct of the workforce\nfrom 2.7 pct (old style) in December, but Wessberg said the\nchange had apparently not been noticed by the press.\n    Recalculated according to the new method, unemployment in\nFebruary 1986 would have stood at 2.2 pct, the SCB said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
