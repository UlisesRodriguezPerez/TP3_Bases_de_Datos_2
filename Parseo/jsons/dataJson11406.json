        "BODY": "A new grade of unleaded gasoline\nnow being test marketed will increase refining costs when\nrefiners can least afford it, according to officials attending\nthe National Petroleum Refiners Association conference here.\n    The new grade of unleaded gasoline has an octane level of\n89 compared with over 90 for super unleaded and 87 for regular\nunleaded gasoline.\n     Amoco Corp <AN> has test-marketed the new mid-grade\ngasoline and hopes to sell it on a regular basis in the South,\nEast and Midwest by the beginning of June, according to Paul\nCollier, executive vice president of marketing.\n    Phillips Petroleum <P> expects to begin marketing the new\n89 octane unleaded gasoline in May, sources said.\n    Converting current refinery operations to produce the 89\noctane unleaded gsoline could cost hundreds of millions of\ndollars per refinery but that depends on the present capacity\nand intensity of the refinery, said Amoco's Collier.\n    But not all oil company's welcome the introduction of\nanother grade of unleaded gasoline.\n    \"Three grades are not warranted,\" said Henry Rosenberg,\nchairman of Crown Central Petroleum <CNP>. \"Refiners will have\nto upgrade again,\" he added.\n    \"An investment will have to be made,\" said Archie Dunham,\nexecutive vice president of petroleum products at Conoco, an\noperating subsidiary of DuPont Corp <DD> in order to upgrade\nrefinery operations.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
