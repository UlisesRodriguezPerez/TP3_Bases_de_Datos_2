        "DATELINE": "    TOKYO, April 8 - ",
        "BODY": "Nippon Steel Corp <NSTC.T> denied local\nnewspaper reports that China has been seeking to buy steel\nplants from Japanese firms which plan to suspend output under\nthe recently announced rationalisation program.\n    The Mainichi Shimbun quoted Nippon Steel as saying that\nChina's State Planning Commission and some Chinese firms have\nasked Japanese makers to sell them steel works and rolling\nmills to expand steelmaking cheaply. It named no sources.\n    A Nippon Steel spokesman told Reuters that China has made\nno such official request, and the company was not considering\nsuch sales at the moment.\n    But Mainichi quoted Nippon Steel officials as saying if\nprices are reasonable, they would export their used mills to\nChina.\n    The paper said China's crude steel output totalled 52 mln\ntonnes in calendar 1986 and that it plans to increase to 80 mln\nby 1996.\n    Japan's steel industry rationalisation plan is aimed at\ncutting production capacity sharply over the next few years.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
