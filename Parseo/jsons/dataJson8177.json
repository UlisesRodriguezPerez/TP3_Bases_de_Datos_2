Other bank stocks also rose\nstrongly and dealers cited speculation already in the market\nthat Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> would make a similar move. Such\n\"scrip\" issues, if they occurred, would mark the first time\nGerman banks had ever issued free shares.\n    The varying reports said Dresdner shareholders may be\noffered one free share for every 15, 18 or 20 already held.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
