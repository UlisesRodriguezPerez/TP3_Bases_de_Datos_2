        "BODY": "The 37,635 deadweight tonnes bulk carrier\nCumberlande, which sank in the South Pacific last Friday, was\ncarrying a cargo which included lead as well as magnesium ore,\na Lloyds Shipping Intelligence spokesman said.\n    He was unable to confirm the tonnages involved.\n    Trade reports circulating the London Metal Exchange said\nthe vessel, en route to New Orleans from Newcastle, New South\nWales, had been carrying 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates.\nTraders said this pushed lead prices higher in early morning\ntrading as the market is currently sensitive to any fundamental\nnews due to its finely balanced supply/demand position and low\nstocks.\n    Trade sources said that 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates\ncould convert to around 5,000 tonnes of metal, although this\ndepended on the quality of the concentrates.\n    A loss of this size could cause a gap in the supply\npipeline, particularly in North America, they noted. Supplies\nthere have been very tight this year and there is a strike at\none major producer, Cominco, and labour talks currently being\nheld at another, Noranda subsidiary Brunswick Mining and\nSmelting Ltd.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
