        "DATELINE": "    TULSA, April 8 - ",
        "BODY": "Williams Cos said it expected oil and\nfertilizer transportation volumes to be flat in 1987 but said\noperating profits from the pipeline unit should improve from\n49.4 mln dlrs earned last year when a seven mln dlr special\ncharge was incurred.\n    Williams Pipeline Co took the charge against earnings in\n1986 for the removal of more than 500 miles of old pipeline\nfrom service and for casualty losses. Companywide, Williams had\na net loss of 134 mln dlrs on total revenues of 1.85 billion\ndlrs, a decline from profits of 32 mln dlrs on sales of 2.46\nbillion in 1985.\n    In its annual report, Williams said its Northwest Pipeline\nCorp and Williams Natural Gas Co had natural gas costs that are\namong the lowest in the nation, averaging 2.04 dlrs and 2.07\ndlrs per mcf, respectively, last year. Total natural gas\nreserves for both units declined to 10,010 billion cubic feet\nin 1986 from 11,334 billion cubic feet the previous year.\n    The company said its Williams Natural Gas unit, which has\nless take-or-pay exposure than most major pipelines, should\nshow improvement in its 1987 operating results because of\nchanges tariff and federal tax rates.\n    The company's gas marketing business is expected to have\nsomewhat lower earnings in 1987 because of competition in its\noperating region, the annual report said. The gas marketing\nunit earned 26.0 mln dlrs on sales of 285.6 mln dlrs last year.\n    Williams also said it expected a substantial decline in its\ndebt to equity ratio this year because of more than 250 mln\ndlrs received in cash from the sale of Agrico Chemical Co and\nproceeds from the sale and leaseback of Williams\nTelecommunications Co. The telecommunications business, a\n2,000-mile fiber optic system for long distance use, will not\nbe profitable until late 1988, Williams said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
