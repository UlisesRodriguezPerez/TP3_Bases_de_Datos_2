        "BODY": "Talks at the extended special meeting of\nthe International Coffee Organization (ICO) on the\nreintroduction of export quotas continued, but chances of\nsuccess were still almost impossible to gauge, delegates said.\n    Producer delegates were meeting to examine a Colombian\nproposal to resume historical quotas from April 1 to September,\nwith a promise to define specific new criteria by which a new\nquota system would be calculated in September for the new crop\nyear, they said.\n    Opinions among delegates over the potential for reaching a\nquota agreement varied widely.\n    Some consumers said the mood of the meeting seemed slightly\nmore optimistic. But Brazil's unwillingness to concede any of\nits traditional 30.55 pct of its export market share looks\nlikely to preclude any accord, other delegates said.\n    No fresh proposals other than the Colombian initiative had\nbeen tabled formally today, delegates said.\n    A full council meeting was set for 1900 hours for a\nprogress report, delegates said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
