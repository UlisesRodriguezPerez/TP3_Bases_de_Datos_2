        "DATELINE": "    AKRON, Ohio, March 24 - ",
        "BODY": "GenCorp Inc said it withdrew from\nconsideration at its annual meeting on March 31 proposals aimed\nat providing for a stock split and an increased dividend so\nthat it could focus its energies on responding to the takeover\noffer made last week by a partnership of AFG Industries Inc\n<AFG> and Wagner and Brown.\n    In addition to proposing an increase in the number of its\noutstanding common shares, GenCorp had suggested the adoption\nof a classified or \"staggered\" board and the elimination of\ncumulative voting.\n    GenCorp said these proposals could \"distract energy and\nattention from the real task at hand -- to respond to the\ntender offer in a manner which is in the best interests of the\ncompany, its shareholders and its other constituencies.\"\n    GenCorp said the proposal to increase its outstanding\nshares was made with the aim of declaring a stock split and a\ndividend increase.\n    The other proposals, it said, would provide for greater\nlong-term stability and cohesiveness for the GenCorp board.\n    The company did not indicate when it might resubmit the\nproposals for approval by its shareholders.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
