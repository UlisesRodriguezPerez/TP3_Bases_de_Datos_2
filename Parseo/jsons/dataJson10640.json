        "BODY": "A senior Nicaraguan official said a\nrecent plunge in coffee prices was economically and politically\ndisastrous for Latin American coffee-producing countries.\n    Nicaraguan Foreign Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca\nwas in London to brief International Coffee Organisation (ICO)\nexecutive board producer members after a meeting last weekend\nin Managua attended by eight Latin American coffee producers to\ndiscuss the fall in coffee prices.\n    London coffee prices slid 300 stg per tonne in March, to\n1,279 stg from 1,580 stg at end-February.\n    Martinez told reporters the price fall since the ICO failed\nto agree export quotas on March 1 has had disastrous results on\nLatin America, both economically and politically.\n    He urged continued negotiations among coffee producers to\npave the way for a coffee export quota agreement by September.\n    Coffee export quotas, used to regulate coffee prices under\nan International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago\nwhen prices soared in response to a drought in Brazil.\n    Central American economic ministers have estimated the\nregion will lose 720 mln dlrs in foreign exchange earnings in\n1987 if coffee prices are not rescued by a quota arrangement,\nMartinez said.\n    He said ICO quota talks broke down last month because\nconsumer members lack the political will to fully support\ncommodity agreements, and because consumers tried to dictate to\nproducers.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
