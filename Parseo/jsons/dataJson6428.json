        "BODY": "Cable and Wireless PLC <CAWL.L> and the\nPacific Telesis group <PAC.N> may take part in a proposed\nmerger of two rival firms seeking to enter Japan's\ninternational telecommunications market, a senior industry\nofficial said.\n    Fumio Watanabe, head of a telecommunications committee with\nthe Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren), told a\nnews conference Japanese shareholders in the two consortiums\nagreed that the U.S. And British companies will be invited to\nparticipate in the new merged firm.\n    The planned linkup will satisfy Tokyo's request that only\none private company should enter the market.\n    The two consortiums, <International Digital Communications\nPlanning Inc> (IDC) and <International Telecom Japan> (ITJ),\nwere set up in 1986 to compete with monopoly <Kokusai Denshin\nDenwa Co> (KDD) after the market was deregulated in 1985.\n    Watanabe said the Post and Telecommunications Ministry\nwanted only one competitor for the time being because of the\nsize of the Japanese telcommunications market and that foreign\ninvestors will only be allowed to hold a minority stake.\n    He estimated the two foreign firms' share in the merged\nconsortium at less than three pct and added that even the\nlargest shareholders could own only some five pct .\n    Cable and Wireless and Japanese trading house <C. Itoh and\nCo.> each have a 20 pct stake in the IDC consortium while\nPacific Telesis and Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc. <MER.N> jointly\nhold 13 pct .\n    ITJ is headed by a rival group of trading houses. Several\nfirms including Toyota Motor Corp. <TOYO.T>  belong to both.\n    Watanabe said progress was being made towards a merger\nagreement and added that Japanese industry agreed with the\ngovernment on having only one private consortium as two\ncompanies might invest \"excessive\" amounts.\n    He said talks with Cable & Wireless will continue this\nweek.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
