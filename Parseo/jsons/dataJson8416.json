        "TITLE": "TIN COUNCIL WINDING-UP VERDICT APPEALED",
        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, March 23 - ",
        "BODY": "Amalgamated Metal Trading, AMT, today\nlodged an appeal against the ruling which prevented its\npetition to wind up the International Tin Council, ITC.\n    The verdict was given by Mr Justice Millett on January 22,\nwhen AMT led an effort by ITC creditors to recover sums claimed\nby banks and London Metal Exchange brokers as a result of the\ncollapse of the ITC's buffer stock operations in October 1985.\nAMT had until March 26 to lodge its appeal.\n    The grounds for the appeal are that the judge erred on\nthree points when giving his verdict, Michael Arnold, head of\nthe broker creditors group Tinco Realisations, told Reuters.\n    The judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no jurisdiction to\nwind up the Tin Council, that the ITC was not an association\nwithin the meaning of the Companies Act, and that the\nwinding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect of an\narbitration award. AMT will contest all three points.\n    The U.K. Companies Act allows the possibility of the\nwinding-up of what it defines as an association, and AMT will\nargue that the Tin Council falls within this definition, Arnold\nsaid.\n    The ITC has immunity except for the enforcement of an\narbitration award, and thus it is important for AMT that the\ncourt accepts that the winding-up petition represents a move to\nenforce an arbitration ruling.\n    The court originally decided that the winding-up petition\nwent wider than the enforcement of such a debt, an AMT\nspokesman said.\n    The appeal is unlikely to be heard for several months, but\na case brought by fellow ITC creditor Maclaine Watson is to be\nheard on April 28. This is a move by the metal broker to have a\nreceiver appointed over the ITC's assets.\n    Since similar arguments will be used in this case, it is\npossible that any appeal in the Maclaine Watson case could be\nconsolidated with AMT's appeal, Arnold said.\n    Other ITC creditors have brought direct actions against the\nCouncil's member states and an application by the governments\nto strike out the first of these, brought by J.H. Rayner\n(Mincing Lane) Ltd, is to be heard on May 11.\n    Shearson Lehman Brothers action against the LME's tin\n\"ring-out\" in March 1986 is also scheduled to be heard in the\nnear future. The hearing date has now been put back slightly to\nJune 8.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
