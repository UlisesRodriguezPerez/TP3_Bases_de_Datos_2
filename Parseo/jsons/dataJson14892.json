        "DATELINE": "    KUALA LUMPUR, April 8 - ",
        "BODY": "Malaysia is unlikely to meet its\ntargeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar\n1987, oil palm growers told Reuters.\n    Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes,\nunchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliser\nand overstressed palms, they said.\n    The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil World\nnewsletter report that Malaysia's oil palm output is likely to\ndrop sharply this year.\n    Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about\n115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell more\npalm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage the\nindustry, a leading grower told Reuters.\n    The country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnes\nagainst about 800,000 last March, the growers said.\n    The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year\ndue to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output.\n    The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean,\nis likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous\n21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.\n    In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expected\nto enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oil\noutput peaks.\n    They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow,\nwith some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new trees\nagainst 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reduction\nwill not be felt for about another three years.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
