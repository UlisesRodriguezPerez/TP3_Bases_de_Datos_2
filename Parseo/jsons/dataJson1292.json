        "DATELINE": "    MIAMI, March 3 - ",
        "BODY": "The chairman of Goodyear Tire and Rubber\nCo, a concern that survived a recent hostile takeover bid,\ncharged that \"terrorists in three-piece suits\" are undermining\nthe nation's industrial base.\nIn a speech to a meeting of south Florida business executives,\nGoodyear Chairman Robert Mercer lashed out at corporate raiders\nand takeover specialists, accusing them of causing serious harm\nto the companies they target.\n  \"Their interest is not in preserving and strengthening\nAmerica's industrial and providing jobs,\" he said. \"Their\nproduct is simply deals, and that is not a product which a\ncountry ... can base a future on.\"\n    Last year, Mercer fought off a takeover attempt by British\nindustrialist Sir James Goldsmith.\n    But Goodyear's independence was preserved at a high price,\nMercer said.\n    The company bought back Goldsmith's stock for 620 mln dlrs,\ngiving him a 93 mln dlr profit. Goodyear also paid him 37 mln\ndlrs for expenses and bought about 41 mln other shares for over\ntwo billion dlrs.\n    In an effort to trim its new debt, Goodyear closed down\nthree plants Mercer believes otherwise could have been saved,\nsold its motor wheel and aerospace units and reduced its\npayroll by 10 pct, he said.\n    Mercer, who plans to testify tomorrow at a Senate hearing\non a proposed bill to control corporate raiders, said hostile\ntakeovers have also hurt workers.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
