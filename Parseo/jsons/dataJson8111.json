        "BODY": "The Development Bank of Singapore Ltd\n(DBS) said Malaysia's real gross domestic product growth (gdp)\nin 1987 could be 1.5 to two pct, above a budget target of one\npct.\n    It said in a report that because of an economic recovery\nand higher foreign exchange reserves, the Malaysian ringgit is\nunlikely to face devaluation in the near future.\n    The report was presented at a two-day investment conference\norganised by the DBS, one of Singapore's four major banks.\n    The report said rising commodity prices and the continued\nexpansion of the manufacturing sector coupled with rigorous\nfiscal restraints and a more stable currency are grounds for\ncautious optimism about the Malaysian economy.\n    It forecast the ringgit will remain stable at between 2.60\nand 2.70 Malaysian dlrs to the U.S. Dollar for the rest of the\nyear.\n    But the report said the growth rate of Malaysia's external\ndebt remains worrying and should be controlled. It said\nMalaysia's external debt totals 48 to 49 billion Malaysian dlrs\nand its debt service ratio exceeds 20 pct.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
