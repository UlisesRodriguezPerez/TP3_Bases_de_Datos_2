        "BODY": "The speaker of the Iranian Parliament,\nHojatoleslam Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, warned the U.S. Not to\nintervene in the Gulf, a day after Washington said its warships\nwere available to escort Kuwaiti tankers through the waterway.\n    \"If U.S. Intervention occurs, the entire world will become\ninsecure for the Americans and the events of Lebanon could be\nrepeated for the Americans everywhere,\" he said.\n    U.S. Defence officials disclosed in Washington yesterday\nthat the U.S. Navy, which has about 24 warships in or near the\nGulf, was prepared to escort Kuwaiti tankers, regular targets\nfor Iranian attacks in an offshoot of its war with Iraq.\n    Rafsanjani, in an interview reported by the Iranian news\nagency IRNA, also commented on earlier U.S. Disclosures that\nIran had erected sites for new Chinese-made Silkworm\nanti-shipping missiles at the Strait of Hormuz.\n    The agency, received in London, quoted him as saying that\nIran did not need missiles to close the strait, 24 miles wide\nat its narrowest, because \"we can close it with artillery only.\"\n    He added \"We have the longest coasts and the highest\ninterest here and the small southern (Gulf) states have a\nlesser interest compared with us and therefore it is natural\nfor us to protect the security of the Strait of Hormuz more\nthan others.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003"
