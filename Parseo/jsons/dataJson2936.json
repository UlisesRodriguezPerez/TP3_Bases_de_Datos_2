        "BODY": "The Treasury proposed allowing \ntemporary imports of South African uranium ore and uranium\noxide until July 1 under certain conditions pending\nclarification of anti-apartheid laws passed by Congress last\nfall.\n    The proposal to be published in the Federal Register next\nweek requests written congressional and public comment within\n60 days and deals with uranium ore and oxide that is imported\nfor U.S. processing and exporting to third countries.\n    The Treasury said it proposed allowing the temporary\nimports because it felt Congress had not intended when it\npassed the comprehensive South African sanctions bill last fall\n-- overriding President Reagan's veto -- to hurt U.S. industry.\n    \"The domestic uranium conversion industry and the federal\ngovernment's enrichment industry could be seriously injured in\na manner not intended by Congress if the . . . import ban on\nuranium ore and oxide were implemented to bar imports for\nprocessing and export through a mistaken interpretation of the\nact,\" the Treasury brief said.\n    The Treasury said an outright U.S. ban of uranium ore and\noxide might cause foreign electric utilities to divert their\nSouth African origin ore and oxide to other countries including\nthe Soviet Union for processing.\n    Treasury said it would allow imports of the South African\nore and oxide until July 1 for processing and re-export\n\"provided that the imported ore or oxide is accompanies by a\nlicense for importation issued by the Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission.\"\n    The Treasury brief also proposed allowing U.S.-origin goods\nto be imported temporarily from South African state-controlled\norganizations for repair or servicing in the United States.\n    \"The U.S. Customs will allow such importation to be made\nunder bond,\" the brief said.\n    The South African sanctions law, enacted by the United\nStates to protest the apartheid laws of racial segregation\npracticed by South Africa's white minority government,\nprohibited imports of uranium ore and oxide, iron and steel,\ncoal and textiles at the end of 1986.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
