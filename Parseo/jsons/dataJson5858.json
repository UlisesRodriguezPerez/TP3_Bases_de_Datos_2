        "DATELINE": "    TOKYO, March 17 - ",
        "BODY": "Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish,\nand operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan\ntakes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris\naccord, foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here.\n    \"The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of\n150.00 yen and to fall even below that level,\" a senior dealer\nat one leading bank said.\n    The dollar has eased this week, but remains stable at\naround 151.50 yen. Six major industrial countries agreed at a\nmeeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability.\n    Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term,\nbut a drastic fall is unlikely because of U.S. Fears of renewed\ninflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S.\nTreasury securities, needed to finance the U.S. Deficit.\n    Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package\nJapan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its\ntrade surplus significantly, and said such measures would\nprobably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar.\n    Under the Paris accord, Tokyo promised a package of\nmeasures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost\ndomestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus.\n    But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition\nboycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition\nof a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slim\nchance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near\nfuture, the dealers said.\n    If no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in the\nU.S. Congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure on\nthe dollar, they said.\n    The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changed\nsince before the Paris accord, they added.\n    \"Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to\na still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook, the international debt\ncrisis triggered by Brazil's unilateral suspension of interest\npayments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the\nReagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra arms\nscandal,\" said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank.\n    \"There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to\naround 140.00 yen by the end of this year,\" said Chemical Bank\nTokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi.\n    But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way\nfor fear of possible concerted central bank intervention.\n    Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U.S.\nFederal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for\nquotes last Wednesday, and even intervened to sell the dollar\nwhen it rose to 1.87 marks.\n    The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London\nwhen it neared 1.60 dlrs on Wednesday, they said.\n    But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central\nbank intervention, saying it may stimulate the dollar's decline\nbecause many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying\nintervention as a chance to sell dollars.\n    However, First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch\nassistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said \"The dollar will not\nshow drastic movement at least to the end of March.\"\n    Other dealers said the U.S. Seems unwilling to see any\nstrong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books\nfor the fiscal year ending on March 31, because a weak dollar\nwould give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on\ntheir foreign holdings, which could make them lose interest in\npurchases of U.S. Treasury securities.\n    U.S. Monetary officials may refrain from making any\ncomments this month to avoid influencing rates, they said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
