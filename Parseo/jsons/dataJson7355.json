        "TITLE": "UK CROSS FIELD PRT RELIEF FAVOURS SMALLER FIELDS",
        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, March 19 - ",
        "BODY": "The \"cross field allowance\" relief on\nPetroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of the\nExchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRT\npaying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co.\n    The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct of\nqualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability of\nother fields. It is restricted to new offshore developments\noutside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval.\n    A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not\npaying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directly\nbenefit in PRT saving on an existing field.\n    \"The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators\nin those fields which have no PRT liability,\" the report said,\nadding that the timing of development of such fields may be\nadvanced.\n    The government would in effect be subsidising these\ndevelopments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before\ncorporation tax, the report said.\n    On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit is\nof timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields will\nbe reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields will\nrise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said.\n    In a study on probable fields, the report said that when\nthe rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-paying\nfield such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in the\nU.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for a\nsmall non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9\npct.\n    The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there will\nbe a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not only\nwill these costs be unavailable for offset against the field's\nfuture profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will\nbe lost.\n    Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts\nwill have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later\ntime.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
