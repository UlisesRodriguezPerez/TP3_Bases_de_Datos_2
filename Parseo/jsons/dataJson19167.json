        "BODY": "Bank of England governor Robin\nLeigh-Pemberton said lowering interest rates too fast could\njeopardise recent economic achievements in the U.K.\n    In remarks prepared for delivery to businessmen in\nBirmingham, he said prospective returns on real investment are\nmore favourable, relative to those on financial assets, than\nfor a good number of years.\n    \"It would surely be foolish to put that favourable\nconjuncture at risk by lowering interest rates prematurely or\nexcessively,\" he said.\n    \"We might enjoy a short-term boost to activity, but at the\nrisk of a damaging return to the uncertainty and acrimony of\nhigh inflation,\" he added.\n    Leigh-Pemberton said he recognised there are some who would\nargue that interest rates are still too high and deter\ninvestment in industry.\n    \"But we should not forget that less than a year ago we were\nintervening to support sterling and had some temporary\ndifficulty in persuading the markets that a one pct increase in\nbase rates, to 11 pct, was a sufficient tightening of policy at\nthe time,\" he added. Base rate is currently nine pct.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
