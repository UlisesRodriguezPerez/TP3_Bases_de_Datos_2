        "DATELINE": "    MINNEAPOLIS, March 6 - ",
        "BODY": "The Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGE)\nwill start trading futures contracts in high fructose corn\nsyrup on April 6 if the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\n(CFTC) approves the contract as expected next week.\n    Pat Henderson, spokesperson for the MGE, said the exchange\nexpects contract approval at CFTC's Tuesday meeting. It has\nbeen under review since the exchange submitted the proposal in\nDecember, 1985.\n    The proposed contract is based on 48,000 pound lots of\n55-pct high fructose corn syrup, the equivalent of one tank\ntruck of the sweetening agent derived from corn in the wet\nmilling process. The syrup, commonly called HFCS-55, is most\ncommonly used as a sweetener in soft drinks and other\nbeverages.\n    Delivery would be by shipping certificate from production\nfacilities designated by the exchange. The contract, designated\nby the symbol \"HF,\" would trade from 0900 to 1315 CST. Months\ntraded would correspond with the Chicago corn futures months of\nMarch, May, July, September and December.\n    Contract price will be quoted per hundred weight, with a\nminimum price fluctuation of one cent and maximum fluctuation\nof one dlr per CWT.\n    \"We hope the producers and users of fructose will be\nactively involved, those producers being the large processors,\nthe corn wet millers, and the users being the beverage\nbottlers,\" Henderson said. \"But there are potentials for all\ntypes of people to use it. There is quite a list of industries\nthat utilize fructose.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
