        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 6 - ",
        "BODY": "The U.S. Treasury proposed allowing \ntemporary imports of South African uranium ore and uranium\noxide until July 1 under certain conditions pending\nclarification of anti-apartheid laws passed by Congress last\nfall.\n    The Treasury said it proposed allowing the temporary\nimports because it felt Congress had not intended when it\npassed the comprehensive South African sanctions bill last fall\n-- overriding President Reagan's veto -- to hurt U.S. industry.\n    The Treasury said an outright U.S. ban of uranium ore and\noxide might cause foreign electric utilities to divert their\nSouth African origin ore and oxide to other countries including\nthe Soviet Union for processing.\n    The Treasury also proposed allowing U.S.-origin goods to be\nimported temporarily from South African state-controlled\norganizations for repair or servicing in the U.S.\n    The South African sanctions law, enacted by the U.S. to\nprotest the apartheid laws of racial segregation practiced by\nSouth Africa's white minority government, prohibited imports of\nuranium ore and oxide, iron and steel, coal and textiles at the\nend of 1986.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
