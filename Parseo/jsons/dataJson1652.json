        "BODY": "The size of French 1986/87 carryover\nbarley stocks, estimated at 1.72 mln tonnes compared with\n700,000 tonnes in 1985/86 is worrying, French Cereals\nIntervention Office (ONIC) Director Bernard Vieux said.\n    He told journalists these estimates were unchanged at the\nend of February from the previous month while export forecasts\nwere lowered to 4.5 mln tonnes from 5.76 mln in 1985/86.\n    Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding a\nlarger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets are\nopened for French barley a large amount could be put into\nintervention.\n    A small amount of French barley has already been put into\nintervention, Vieux said without detailing the amount.\n    The outlook for French maize is better with 1986/87 exports\nto non-EC countries now put at 700,000 tonnes against 200,000\ntonnes at the end of January and against 155,000 tonnes in\n1985/86.\n    The higher estimate is due to the EC Commission's decision\nto hold special export tenders for French maize, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
