        "BODY": "Manufacturers Hanover Corp said it\nplaced 1.4 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to\nBrazilian borrowers on non-accrual as of yesterday, meaning\nthat income will be recorded only when actual cash payments are\nreceived.\n    As a result, net income for the first quarter will be\nreduced by 18 mln dlrs.\n    If Brazil, which suspended interest payments on its term\ndebt on February 20, continues to defer interest payments for\nthe rest of the year, net income for the whole of 1987 would be\nreduced by a total of 72 mln dlrs.\n    U.S. bank accounting guidelines do not require loans to be\nplaced on nonaccrual unless interest payments are past due 90\ndays or more.  However, Manufacturers Hanover said that, in\nlight of current circumstances, it was more appropriate to\nrecord income on its Brazilian loans only when cash payments\nwere received.\n    It added that it believes Brazil will reach agreement with\nits banks on a debt restructuring and that all interest\npayments will be received later in 1987.\n    The company earned 102.1 mln dlrs in first-quarter 1986 and\n410.7 mln dlrs for the whole of the year.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
