        "BODY": "Japan should increase foreign access to\nits farm products market, while encouraging further development\nof domestic agriculture, a government report said.\n    The white paper on agriculture for the year ended March 31\nsaid active participation in writing world farm trade rules at\nthe next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)\ntalks will help prepare Japan to improve access.\n    Agriculture Ministry sources said the paper marked an\neasing in Japan's tough position on agricultural imports which\nstressed the need for strict controls on some products to\nmaintain self-sufficiency in food.\n    Japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs,\ndown from 61 pct some 20 years ago, official figures show.\n    The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow to\nimprove productivity and demand/supply imbalances.\n    The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainly\nresponsible for higher domestic prices, it said.\n    The strong yen has meant lower input material prices but\nhas also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has\nworsened working conditions among part-time farmers, the paper\nsaid.\n    This could make it difficult to improve the industry's\nstructure, the paper said.\n    To solve these problems and to reduce farm product prices\nto more reasonable levels, Japan should try to restructure the\nthe agricultural sector to improve productivity and make it\nself-supporting, it said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
