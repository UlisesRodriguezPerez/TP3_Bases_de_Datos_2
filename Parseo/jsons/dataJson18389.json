        "TITLE": "BASIN PIPELINE REOPENS IN U.S. SOUTHWEST",
        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, June 15 - ",
        "BODY": "The Basin Pipeline in the Southwestern\nU.S. reopened yesterday with the expectation that all crude oil\nshipments for June will arrive on schedule, according to a\nspokesman for Texaco Inc. <TX>, operator of the pipeline\nthrough its Texaco Pipeline Co subsidiary.\n    \"We project the pipeline will make all June crude shipments\nscheduled,\" said Dan Stevens, the spokesman. \n    The pipeline reopened Sunday evening around 1900 EDT,\ncarrying an equivalent 280,000 barrels of crude oil per day\ncompared with an average 225,000 bpd shipped during the 30 days\nbefore its shutdown on May 30, according to Stevens.\n    Stevens said the increased shipments will make up for all\ncrude oil scheduled to arrive in Cushing, Oklahoma via the\npipeline by the end of June.\n    The pipeline was shut May 30 because of an apparent rupture\ncaused by flooding of the Red River, near the Texas/Oklahoma\nborder. It was expected to resume service Saturday but rising\nwaters of the river, which had recently receded, delayed the\nreopening, Stevens said. Approximately 1100 feet of new 24-inch\nsteel piping was installed under the river to replace damaged\npiping, according to Stevens.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
