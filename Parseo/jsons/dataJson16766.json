        "BODY": "The Washington Post said the U.S.\nCommerce Department yesterday issued a new report showing that\nthe U.S. Merchandise trade deficit was 13.65 billion dollars in\nFebruary, a reduction of 1.4 billion dlrs from the 15.06\nbillion figure the department reported only two days earlier.\n    The newspaper said: \"News of the unexpectedly large 15\nbillion deficit helped batter the dollar's value on foreign\nexchange markets and boosted U.S. Interest rates.\n    \"However, the new report went largely unnoticed by financial\nmarkets since such a downward revision in the deficit is a\nmonthly occurrence.\"\n    The Washington Post said: \"By law, the department must first\npublish what a top commerce official agreed are misleading\ntrade figures and then wait 48 hours before putting out the\nmore accurate ones.\"\n    No one was immediately available at the Commerce Department\nfor comment on the Washington Post report.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
