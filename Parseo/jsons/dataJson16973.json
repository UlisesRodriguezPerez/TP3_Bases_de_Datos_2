        "BODY": "The Japanese government is considering\nbuying U.S.-made supercomputers to help defuse mounting trade\nfriction between the two countries, Trade Minister Hajime\nTamura was quoting as saying.\n    Japanese officials said Tamura told visiting U.S. Trade\nRepresentative Clayton Yeutter that the government may set\naside money for the purchase of the supercomputers in a\nsupplementary budget to be drawn up later this year.\n    But he emphasised that the matter was still under study and\nthat no firm decision had been made.\n    Tamura urged Yeutter to lift the trade sanctions imposed\nagainst Japan and argued that the yen's rapid rise was already\nworking to correct the country's trade imbalance.\n    But, according to Japanese officials, Yeutter held out\nlittle hope that the American trade sanctions would be lifted\nsoon and said the United States needed action from Japan to\nboost its domestic demand and imports, not just words.\n    In order to lift the tariffs imposed on 300 mln dlrs worth\nof Japanese exports last Friday, the U.S. Needs proof that its\njoint computer chip pact with Japan is working. And that will\ntake time, Yeutter was quoted as telling Tamura.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
