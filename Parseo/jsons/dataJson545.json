But it said the talks did\nnot produce any agreements or understandings.\n    WEDGE said it believes that \"some form of restructuring of\nAMI and its business would be highly desirable and appropriate\nat this time.\"\n    WEDGE, which holds 4.8 mln shares of AMI common stock, said\nit plans to hold further talks with company management, Pesch\nand other shareholders.\n    Pesch last week sweetened his bid for the company to 22\ndlrs a share in cash and securties, or 1.91 billion dlrs based\non AMI's total outstanding, from an all-cash 20 dlr a share\nbid, which the company rejected.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
