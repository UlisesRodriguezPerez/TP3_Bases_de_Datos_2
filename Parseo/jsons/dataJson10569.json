        "DATELINE": "    KANSAS CITY, March 27 - ",
        "BODY": "A cold air mass working its way\nsouth from Canada may pose a threat to developing hard red\nwinter wheat in Oklahoma, according to Eugene Krenzler, wheat\nspecialist for the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension.\n    \"There is some threat. Some of the crop is far enough along\nso that it's probably vulnerable,\" Krenzler said.\n    Accu Weather meteorologist Dale Mohler said cold air moving\nfrom the north could put temperatures in the middle 20's\nfahrenheit as early as tonight, depending on development of a\nlow pressure area over southeast Colorado which could stall the\nsystem.\n    If impeded by the low-pressure area, the cold air could hit\nOklahoma and Texas as late as Monday morning. Temperatures\ncould stay in the mid-20's for up to eight hours, Mohler said.\n    Krenzler said less than 10 pct of the Oklahoma wheat crop\nhas advanced to boot stage. The closer to that stage the more\nvulnerable the head of the wheat is to cold weather, he said.\n    \"We can handle probably an hour or so down to 25 or 26\ndegrees (fahrenheit),\" Krenzler said, \"as long as we don't have\na lot of wind.\"\n    \"If we do get six hours down below 25 degrees I'd say we\nhave a good chance of significant damage to the heads,\" he\nsaid.\n    Krenzler said early planted stands in the north-central and\nsouthwestern parts of the state are probably most vulnerable.\nCrops in the panhandle of Oklahoma and Texas are less developed\nand have some snow cover protection from the cold, he noted.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
