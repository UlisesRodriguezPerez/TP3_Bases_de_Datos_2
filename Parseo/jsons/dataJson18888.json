        "BODY": "A South African trade union is in\ndispute with a subsidiary of Britain's Johnson Matthey Plc over\nthe company's proposal to move a platinum refinery near\nJohannesburg to a black tribal homeland.\n    The 30,000-member mainly black Chemical Workers Industrial\nUnion said it fears the planned move to the Bophuthatswana\nhomeland, where South African unions are not recognised, could\nlead to job losses and affect wages.\n    A mass dismissal last year at the Impala Platinum Holdings\nLtd <IPLA.J> mines in the tribal homeland sent world platinum\nprices rocketing.\n\n    The union said talks with management over the proposed move\nhad broken down. It said an earlier ballot of refinery workers\nshowed that most favoured striking over the move but added that\nno final decision had been taken on strike action.\n    The refinery processes all platinum metals of Rustenburg\nPlatinum Holdings Ltd, the world's largest platinum producer.\n    It is owned by Matthey Rustenburg Ltd, a joint-subsidiary\nof Johnson Matthey and Rustenburg which, in turn, is owned by\nmining group Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Co Ltd.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
