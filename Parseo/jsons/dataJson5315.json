        "BODY": "Indonesia has imported palm oil this\nyear and is likely to take more, trade sources said.\n    They were commenting on a weekend Jakarta report quoting a\nMinistry of Trade spokesman as saying Indonesia had not issued\nlicences to import the commodity. He also said there was no\nsign of a shortage of palm oil in Indonesia.\n    A major palm oil dealer said he shipped Malaysian palm oil\nto Indonesia in February, additional vessels were loading this\nmonth and other vessels had been earmarked for April.\n    Other operators claimed they had palm oil booked for\nIndonesia but would not disclose tonnages.\n    Traders said palm oil production in Indonesia this year had\nbeen below expectations and current stocks were low. They said\nlicences were issued at the start of the year to import crude\npalm oil but were subsequently revised to include RBD olein and\nRBD oil.\n    Last week there were rumours in European markets that\nIndonesia had issued licences to import around 135,000 tonnes\nof palm oil for deliveries commencing April. An Indonesian\nMinistry of Trade official said this was incorrect.\n    Some traders here said the total could be more. Others said\nthey could include those issued earlier this year and\napplications not yet granted.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
