        "BODY": "Bangladesh's trade gap is expected to\nwiden in fiscal 1987/88 beginning on July 1 after the\ngovernment relaxed restrictions on some imports including\nluxury cars.\n    The country has set its export target for the year at 1.1\nbillion U.S. Dlrs against imports of 1.805 billion dlrs,\ncompared with 1986/7's one billion dlrs of export earnings and\n1.113 billion dlrs of imports.\n    Commerce Minister Mohammad Abdul Munim said the changes\nwere aimed at encouraging export oriented industries to boost\nforeign exchange earnings and imports of essential machinery\nand raw materials, to increase industrial production.\n    The government was easing procedures to enhance incentives\nespecially for exporters of textiles and frozen food and\nimporters of industrial machinery and raw materials, Munim told\nreporters.\n    Commerce Ministry officials told Reuters the import policy\ncovered only commercial imports amounting to 1.805 billion\ndlrs. Imports of capital machinery and foodgrains by the\ngovernment were not included in the policy, they added.\n    They said the country's total import bill (both commercial\nand other imports) was expected to reach 2.7 billion dlrs in\nthe new year compared with 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87.\n    The minister said ending restrictions on imports of cars\nand dropping 50 pct sales tax on small cars would not harm the\neconomy.\n    Munim said Bangladesh feared a further drop in prices for\nits main export jute, \"which will certainly affect our export\nearnings\" in the coming year.\n    Bangladesh's jute exports fell to 410 mln dlrs from 500 mln\nin 1986/87, according official figures.\n    But Munim said exports of non-traditional items, which\naccounted for over 40 pct of total exports this year, would\nplay a key role in achieving the 1987/88 export target.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
