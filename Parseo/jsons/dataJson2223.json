        "BODY": "World grain trade could be turning\nthe corner and heading toward recovery in the 1986-87 season, a\nCargill, Inc. analyst said.\n    Writing in the March issue of the Cargill Bulletin, David\nRogers of Cargill's Commodity Marketing Division cited a\ngradual rise in world wheat trade in recent months, with a slow\nrise in wheat prices after recent historic lows.\n    He said the wheat trade, because wheat can be produced in\nmany nations, is a good barometer of world grain trade and\ncould lead to more activity in other grain markets.\n    Rogers said that with world grain prices at their lowest\nlevel in over a quarter of a century in real terms, demand has\nbegun to rise while producing nations are re-examining their\nexpensive price-support policies and reducing planted acres.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
