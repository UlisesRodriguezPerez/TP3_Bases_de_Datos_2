        "BODY": "China expects its 1987 grain harvest to be\n397 mln tonnes, eight mln tonnes short of its target, the New\nChina News Agency quoted a State Statistical Bureau spokesman\nas saying.\n    The harvest will be China's second highest in history but\npoor weather and low incentives for grain-producing farmers\nhave kept yields down, earlier Chinese press reports said.\n    Industry sources expect China to import at least 10 mln\ntonnes of grain this year because of the harvest shortfall.\n    Chinese customs figures showed grain imports of 9.59 mln\ntonnes in the first eight months of 1987, compared with 6.09\nmln in the same 1986 period.\n    Agriculture Minister He Kang said last month state prices\nfor grain purchase from growers were to be adjusted to increase\nthe incentive for grain production.\n    China could not afford to become a major food importer, he\nsaid.\n    The State Statistics Bureau spokesman also said China's\n1987 cotton output was expected to rise 10 pct over 1986 to 390\nmln tonnes.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
