        "BODY": "a confidential world bank report on the\nperuvian economy said the government's strategy does not offer\ngood prospects for medium and long-term growth and is likely to\nquickly lead to inflation.\n    The report, published today by an economic monthly, the\nperu report, said the success of president alan garcia's\ngovernment in stimulating output last year to achieve eight pct\ngross domestic product growth \"represents gains in the short\nterm at the expense of the long.\"\n    Government officials had no immediate comment on the\nreport, which advised a reduction in the overall size of the\npublic investment programme and greater emphasis on the\npreservation of peru's export potential.\n    The report said that although the government had succeeded\nin cutting inflation 50 pct a year in the first half of 1985 to\nunder 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivation programme was\nencountering increasing difficulties.\n    \"an early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked to\nmonetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing of\nprice controls, appears not improbable,\" it added.\n\n\u0003"
