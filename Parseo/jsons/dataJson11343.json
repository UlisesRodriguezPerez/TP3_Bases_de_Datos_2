        "BODY": "The Kansas City Board of Trade,\nKCBT, has asked federal futures regulators to modify a proposal\nto raise the Chicago Board of Trade's, CBT, speculative\nposition limits on wheat futures contracts, saying the plan\nwould put the the Kansas exchange \"at a serious competitive\ndisadvantage.\"\n    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, last month\nproposed raising CBT wheat speculative limits to 1,200\ncontracts all months net from 600 contracts, and to 900\ncontracts for any single month from 600 contracts.\n    At the same time, CFTC proposed leaving KCBT's wheat\nspeculative position limits unchanged.\n    \"Higher limits for CBT wheat than for KCBT wheat would\nsignificantly impair the KCBT's ability to compete with the CBT\nfor speculative interest,\" Michael Braude, president of the\nKansas exchange, said in a letter to CFTC.\n    A CFTC spokesman said the commission took into account open\ninterest affected by existing speculative limits in proposing\nto raise CBT's limits.\n    KCBT said the CFTC proposal would reduce hedging\nefficiency, constrain growth of intermarket spreading and of\nthe exchange's wheat options contract and impair its ability to\nattract large speculators.\n    The Kansas City exchange asked the commission to amend its\nproposal to change the limits for KCBT wheat to the exact same\nbushel amount as specified for CBT wheat.\n    CFTC will consider public comments on the proposal until\nJune 3.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
