        "BODY": "High wage settlements in Nordic countries\nthreaten to cut exports and reduce the international\ncompetitiveness of their industries, the Organisation for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.\n    In Denmark, the OECD said wage settlements concluded in\nearly 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deterioration\nin competitiveness. Sweden's competitive position was also seen\nat risk from accelerating wages.\n    The OECD predicted that domestic demand would come under\npressure from tight fiscal policy in Denmark, as well as\nNorway, Sweden and Finland.\n    Overall economic growth will vary in the different\ncountries between 1986 and 1988, the OECD semi-annual report\nsaid.\n    After a strong rise of 7.8 pct in 1986, total domestic\ndemand in Norway was seen falling by 1.5 pct in 1987 and one\npct the following year. Denmark was also expected to see a\nslump in domestic demand. The report said growth in Gross\nDomestic Product (GDP) was likely to speed up slightly in\nSweden and Finland in 1987 and 1988, while declining in Denmark\nand Norway.\n    Iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economic\nstrategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustained\nand balanced non-inflationary growth, the OECD said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
