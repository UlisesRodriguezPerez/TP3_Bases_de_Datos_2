        "BODY": "West German exports to the United\nStates fell below four billion marks worth in January for the\nfirst time since mid-1984, provisional Bundesbank data showed.\n    The figures showed exports were 3.85 billion marks in\nJanuary, sharply down from December's 4.40 billion and the\nlowest since the 3.56 billion exported to the U.S. In July\n1984. This compared with 4.86 billion marks in January 1986.\n    Total West German exports to Western industrialised\ncountries also fell in January to 34.76 billion marks from\nDecember's 36.45 billion, also posting the lowest monthly total\nsince July 1984.\n    West German exports to the European Community were 21.60\nbillion marks in January, down from 22.14 billion in December\nand 22.94 billion in January last year, the figures showed.\n    Exports to developing nations and centrally-planned\neconomies also slackened.\n    Separately, Commerzbank AG said in a report that the focus\nof West German exports this year was likely to shift to Europe\nbecause of an expected downturn in growth in the dollar area.\n    This was one of the strengths of West German exports\ncompared with Japan, which depended in large part on the U.S.,\nOPEC and developing country markets, it added.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
