        "DATELINE": "    HOUSTON, March 25 - ",
        "BODY": "Pennzoil Co said it had not yet\nreceived any \"meaningful settlement offer\" from Texaco Inc but\nadded that the company remained willing to consider proposals\nto settle the 10.2 billion dlr jury judgment it won against\nTexaco.\n    In its newly-released annual report to shareholders,\nPennzoil said it expected the Texas state court judgment, which\nwas upheld by a state appeals court on February 12, to be\nupheld if appealed again.\n    \"To date, Pennzoil has yet to receive any meaningful\nsettlement offer from Texaco, though it remains open to any\nrealistic effort to settle the matter,\" Pennzoil chairman Hugh\nLiedtke said in the annual report.\n    Pennzoil also said it had budgeted 212 mln dlrs for capital\nspending in 1987, a drop from the 233 mln dlrs spent last year.\n    Proved U.S. and foreign reserves of natural gas declined to\n964 billion cubic feet last year, from 1.01 trillion cubic feet\nin 1985, because of a virtual halt in its exploration program,\nPennzoil said. Its crude oil reserves dropped to 140 mln\nbarrels from 158 mln barrels in 1985.\n     The Houston-based company said it sold an average of 339\nmln cubic feet of domestic natural gas each day last year, a 17\npct drop from 1985. The average sales price for gas dropped by\n60 cents per mcf to 2.16 dlrs per mcf, Pennzoil said.\n    U.S. crude oil and gas liquids production last year fell to\nan average of 33,290 barrels per day from 34,102 barrels per\nday in 1985.\n    The company's total revenues in 1986 declined to 482.3 mln\ndlrs, from 762.5 mln dlrs the previous year. Operating income\nin 1986 fell more than 80 pct, to 38.0 mln dlrs.\n    Pennzoil said its goals for 1987 included development of\nits Point Arguello oilfield off the California coast, to\nmaintain current production levels in its Bluebell-Altamont\nField in Utah and to drill for prospects in the Gulf of\nMexico's Mobile Bay area.\n    \"Production should begin late in the year from the Harvest\nPlatform in the Santa Maria Basin offshore California,\" the\ncompany said. \"Pennzoil's share of this production initially\nshould be five thousand barrels a day, increasing to a peak of\n15 thousand barrels a day, net, by 1989.\"\n    In its sulphur business, Pennzoil said production totaled\n2.1 mln long tons last year, a decline of 18 pct from 1985. The\naverage sales price also declined, to 138.25 dlrs per long ton\nfrom 141.05 dlrs in 1985.\n    \"The long term outlook for our sulphur operations remains\nbright,\" the company said. \"We expect sulphur's pricing\nstructure to strengthen during the current year, probably in\nthe third and fourth quarters.\"\n            \n Reuter\n\u0003"
