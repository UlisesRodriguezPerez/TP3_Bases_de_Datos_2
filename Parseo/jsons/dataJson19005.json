        "BODY": "Australia's economy should manage modest\ngrowth over the next two years after a sharp slowdown but\nunemployment could still edge upwards, the Organisation for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.\n    The organisation's latest half-yearly report says Gross\nDomestic Product will grow by 2.5 pct this year and by 2.75 pct\nin 1988 compared with only 1.4 pct in 1986. The growth will be\nhelped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demand\nfollowing tax cuts and higher real wages, it added.\n    The report forecasts a decline in inflation, with consumer\nprices increasing by 8.5 pct this year and 6.25 pct in 1988.\n    The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightly\nand could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.\n    While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year,\nhowever, the report revises downwards the OECD's earlier growth\nforecast for 1987 of 3.75 pct.\n    The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economic\ngrowth and rising unemployment for New Zealand, which is\nstruggling to recover from a major economic crisis.\n    The country's GDP, which contracted by 0.6 pct last year,\nshould again show growth over the next two years, rising by\n0.25 pct this year and a more substantial 2.75 pct in 1988.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
