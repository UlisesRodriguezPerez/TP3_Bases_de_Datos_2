        "BODY": "The Soviet Union has agreed to supply\nIran with refined oil products in exchange for 100,000 barrels\nper day of crude, Iran's national news agency, IRNA, said.\n    IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Oil Minister Gholamreza\nAqazadeh as saying on his return to Tehran from Moscow that the\nagreement was part of a protocol on economic cooperation signed\nduring his visit. The amount of crude delivered to the Soviet\nUnion might double to 200,000 bpd later, he said.\n    Aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibility\nstudies for a pipeline to take Iranian crude from fields in\nsouthern Iran to the Black Sea through the Soviet Union.\n    Iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part of\nits oil exports from Iraqi air attacks in the Gulf.\n    Irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the Soviet\nUnion, which Aqazadeh had said would be discussed before he\nleft for Moscow.\n    Iran lost most of its refining capacity early in the Gulf\nwar and now imports several hundred thousand bpd of refined\nproducts.\n    Aqazadeh said Soviet refined products would be delivered at\nthe Caspian Sea ports of Anzali and Nowshahr, at Neka, near the\nCaspian, and at Jolfa in north-west Iran.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
