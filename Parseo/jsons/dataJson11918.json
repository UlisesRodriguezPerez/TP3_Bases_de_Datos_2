        "BODY": "Thyssen AG <THYH.F> expects a fall of\nbetween 15 and 20 pct in consolidated turnover in 1986/87,\nchief executive Dieter Spethmann said.\n    He told journalists the exact decline would depend on\ndollar developments. The Thyssen group did over 50 pct of its\nbusiness outside West Germany.\n    Spethmann made no comment on 1986/87 group earnings. World\ngroup net profit fell to 370.1 mln marks in the year ended\nSeptember 1986 from 472.4 mln a year earlier on group sales\nwhich fell to 40.00 billion marks from a previous 44.32\nbillion.\n    Last week Spethmann told the annual meeting Thyssen\nexpected to post a good profit in 1986/87 despite expected\nlosses in the mass steel-making operations this year.\n    Spethmann said engineering turnover would not be lower this\nyear, but lower steel prices would result in a drop in steel\nturnover and sales volume. This would also affect Thyssen's\ntrading operations, he said.\n    Spethmann also categorically denied a magazine article\npublished this week which spoke of a dispute between him and\nHeinz Kriwet, management board chairman of Thyssen Stahl AG,\nover planned job cuts in steel plants in the Ruhr area.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
