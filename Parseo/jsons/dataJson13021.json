        "BODY": "The United Food And Commercial\nWorkers said that more than 1,000 rank-and-file members of the\nunion will demonstrate Monday at Dart Group Corp's headquarters\nprotesting Dart's proposed 1.73 billion dlr takover of\nSupermarkets General <SGL>.\n    Supermarkets is best known for its Pathmark chain of\nsupermarket drug stores in the New York and New Jersey area and\nalso owns Rickels home centers.\n    The union said that it is firmly against the Dart bid\nbecause \"workers have always ended up with a raw deal in the\ncurrent takeover mania.\"\n    A Union statement said: \"We do not intend to allow our\nmembers to pick up the tab for Supermarket General's executives\nand the bankers or the Dart Group who stand to make millions.\"\n    Dart is controlled by the Haft family of Washington, which\nlast year made a bid for California-based Safeway Stores Inc.\nThe Hafts lost, but walked away with at least 100 mln dlrs in\nprofits, analysts estimate.\n    The union said that Dart's Safeway bid forced a major\nrestructuring at Safeway to pay the Hafts and their lawyers and\ncaused a loss of thousands of jobs.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
