        "BODY": "Britain is not considering any\nrestriction of its present oil production, UK Energy Minister\nAlick Buchanan-Smith said.\n     Speaking to reporters at the Offshore Technology\nConference, Buchanan-Smith said, \"No, we've made that\nabsolutely clear, we see no reason for changing (the production\nlevel).\"\n     Earlier today, Buchanan-Smith gave the go-ahead to Mobil\nCorp for two new North Sea developments -- the Ness oil field\nand Beryl B subsea water injection project -- totalling 96 mln\ndlrs (60 mln British pounds).\n     Unlike Norway, which has restricted its production of\nNorth Sea oil by 80,000 barrels a day in an effort to stabilize\nworld oil prices, Britain has consistently refused to intervene\nin the market place.\n     Buchanan-Smith also said there may be a demand-supply gap\nin the 1990s for natural gas in Britain, but added that it\nwould probably be less than had been previously estimated.\n     Norway is a major producer of natural gas and this morning\nNorway's Energy Minister Arne Oien said he was hoping Britain\nwill take more Norwegian gas in the 1990s.\n     Buchanan-Smith also said he expects to announce the\nresults of the 10th licensing round of North Sea tracts next\nmonth.\n     He said there had been 75 applications for 127 tracts by\n84 companies, and added that he expects about 50 blocks will be\nlicensed.\n     He said the results would be in line with rounds prior to\nbut not equal to the ninth two years ago, which was one of the\nmost successful ever.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
