        "BODY": "Ames Department Stores Inc fell 1-7/8\nto 23 in what analysts said was a reaction to a surprise\nannouncement earlier today by the company that earnings in the\nfiscal year ended January 31 will decline sharply.\n    Ames said it expects to report earnings of between 72 and\n77 cts per share compared with 1.19 dlrs per share in the\nprevious year.\n    \"We were looking for 1.15 dlrs,\" said an analyst at a major\nWall Street firm who declined to be identified. Ames said most\nof the decline resulted from an inventory shortage at its\nSecaucus, N.J. distribution center.\n    \"The obvious suspicion is that there has been some kind of\nfraud or theft,\" said Ralph Shulansky, senior vice president of\nAmes. \"We do not have hard evidence we are still putting things\ntogether.\"\n    He said it would take several weeks for the company to\ncomplete an investigation. He said there are no law enforcement\nofficials involved at this time.\n    He declined to quantify the inventory shortage but said it\nwas the major reason for the decline in earnings. A decline in\ngross margin percentage and an increase in the effective tax\nrate also contributed to the downturn, Ames said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
