        "BODY": "West German Economics Minister Martin\nBangemann indirectly rejected a call from the country's leading\neconomic research institutes for early introduction of a major\ntax reform involving gross tax cuts of 44 billion marks.\n    In a statement reacting to the five institutes' joint\nspring report, Bangemann said that as far as the call for\nbringing forward the 1990 tax reform was concerned --\n    \"The government points out that the positive effects for\ngrowth of its policy of consolidation (cutting the budget\ndeficit) must not be allowed to be endangered.\"\n    Bangemann also recalled that the scope of tax cuts planned\nfor 1988 had already been increased.\n    Three institutes predicted two pct economic growth in 1987,\nwith exports falling by 0.5 pct. The other two saw only one pct\ngrowth and said exports would fall 2.5 pct.\n    Bangemann said \"The government, agreeing with the majority,\nsees no reason for the extraordinarily pessimistic estimate for\nexports expressed by the minority.\"\n    He said there was reason to believe that export demand\nwould start to rise in the course of the year, partly because\nof a further increase in world trade.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
