        "BODY": "The economy faces lackluster growth\nand the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement\nin U.S. exports should falter, economists say.\n    Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness\nin the key housing and auto sectors and could be further\nhampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say.\n    \"These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength\nto keep the economy from tipping into a recession?\" said Lyle\nGramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers\nAssociation and a former Federal Reserve Board official.\n    The Commerce Department said this week that the economy\ngrew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, but\na U.S. monetary official called it a weak report.\n    Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spending\nrose a weak 0.1 per cent.\n    \"Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing --\nare faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, \"\nMartin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics,\ntold Reuters.\n    Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow\nbecause inflation is rising faster than real wages.\n    To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise,\nreturning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost\npersonal income and consumption, he says.\n    \"I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to\nkeep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,\"\nGramley said.\n    Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters\nthat the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the\nresult of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last\nand said the recovery was showing anemia.\n    Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, \"The pace\nof the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into\nmonetary policy\" - possibly a signal that the Fed will be\naccommodative.\n    Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct\nforecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if\nthe dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and add\nto the risk of a recession.\n    Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in May\ncame despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where an\ninventory overhang still exists.\n    He says the boost in production came from smaller\nindustries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which have\nimproved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar.\n    \"They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in\neconomic activity, but I think they will keep us out of a\nrecession,\" Mauro said.\n    In a speech to financial planners this week, Beryl\nSprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted the\ntrade deficit will continue to improve.\n    \"Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and\ninto 1988 are still quite favorable,\" he said.\n    But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in\ninflation.\n    Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers\nInc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5\nto five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after\na 1.1 pct increase in 1986.\n    The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oil\nand energy prices and rising prices for services, he said.\n    \"The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets\nout of the bottle, it continues to persist,\" he said, adding he\nwould like the Fed to tighten credit.\n    A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the\ndollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, says\na prominent international banker.\n    Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the National\nPress Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen and\nthe mark will continue for years because the United States is\nthe world's largest debtor nation.\n    The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a\nfurther slackening of activity and called naive the belief that\nthe five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever.\n\"It is very difficult to be optimistic,\" Gut said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
