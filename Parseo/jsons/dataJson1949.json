        "BODY": "The Nigerian naira firmed 2.6 pct against\nthe dollar after 17 banks were disqualified from bidding at\ntoday's weekly foreign exchange auction, the central bank said.\nThe naira finished at 3.8050 to the dollar, against 3.9050 last\nweek.\n    Only 38.39 mln dlrs of the 50 mln dlrs on offer was sold,\nwith all 27 bidding banks successfully obtaining hard currency.\n    The effective rate, including a central bank levy, for\ntransactions in the coming week, was 3.8241 against 3.9246 last\nweek.\n    The failure to sell the whole allocation was due to the\ncentral bank's unprecedented disqualification of 17 banks as\npunishment for inadequate documentation in previous\ntransactions.\n    Banks are required to submit proof that their bids are\nbased on valid commercial transactions and the central bank has\ncomplained in the past that many are failing to produce the\nright paperwork within the specified time.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
