The new facility will replace the current\n4.8 billion guilders of seven-day advances expiring Monday.\n    Money dealers estimated today's money market shortage at 11\nto 11.25 billion guilders, barely changed from yesterday.\n    They said call money was still relatively high at 6-1/8 to\n6-1/4 pct as a result of the tight set of bids accepted by the\nBank for the previous seven-day facility.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
