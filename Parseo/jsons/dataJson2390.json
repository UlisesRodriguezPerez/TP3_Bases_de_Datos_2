        "BODY": "The Commerce Department on Monday\nwill set final dumping duties on frozen orange juice from\nBrazil, department officials said.\n    A preliminary duty of 8.54 pct was set last Oct 17 on the\nimports, which run at about 700 mln dlrs a year. Commerce's\nruling on Monday will reset the duties on the basis of more\ndetailed cost information, industry officials said.\n    The duties now are being assessed on a temporary basis,\npending a final ruling by the U.S. International Trade\nCommission (ITC) on whether the imports are injuring the\ndomestic orange industry.\n    The ITC ruled provisionally last June 18 that the domestic\nindustry was being injured by Brazilian orange juice imports.\n    A complaint that the Brazilian imports were being dumped at\nbelow costs on the U.S. market was filed on behalf of U.S.\ngrowers by the Florida Citrus Mutual, a Lakeland, Fla., group,\nAlcoma Packing Co, Inc, and Barry Citrus Products.\n    U.S. officials say about half of the orange juice consumed\nin the United States comes from Brazil.\n reuter\n\u0003"
