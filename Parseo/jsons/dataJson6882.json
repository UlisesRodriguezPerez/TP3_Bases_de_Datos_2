        "BODY": "Asked what the U.S. State\nDepartment's policy is on offering subsidized wheat to Moscow,\nSecretary of State George Shultz told a group of farm leaders\nthat U.S. products must be competitive in the world market.\n    \"If we are going to sell our products, whatever they may\nbe, wheat or anything else, then we have to meet the market,\"\nShultz told the board of directors for the National Association\nof Wheat Growers.\n    \"We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say that\nsomebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same\nthing at a lower price somewhere else. They just aren't,\" he\nsaid.\n    \"That is our approach in the negotiations with the Soviets,\nand it must be our approach as we look at the American farm\nprogram and try to figure out what we should do to make it\nbetter,\" Shultz told the Wheat Growers.\n    Schultz said that while he does not favor a situation that\nwould allow the Soviet housewife to buy food cheaper than the\nAmerican housewife, he realizes the importance of American\nagricultural products being competitively priced.\n    Speculation has been in the market for some time that the\nUnited States is considering offering wheat to the Soviet Union\nat subsidized prices.\n    Soviet officials have said they would buy U.S. wheat if it\nwere competitively priced. Agriculture Department officials\nhave declined to take any official position on the issue.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
