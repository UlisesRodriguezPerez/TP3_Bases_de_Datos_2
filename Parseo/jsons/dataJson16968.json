        "BODY": "U.S. Interior Secretary Donald Hodel\nsaid there was a one in five chance that new drilling in Alaska\nwould find oil.\n    \"But if it's there, there's a very good chance that it would\nbe a giant field,\" Hodel said on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\"\n    \"So it is the best geological prospect that they\n(geologists) have talked to me about since I've been involved\nin this process,\" he said.\n    Hodel announced yesterday that he would urge Congress to\nopen up 1.5 mln acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in\nAlaska to oil exploration despite fears of environmental damage\nthreatening the Caribou herd in the region.\n    He said today the exploration was needed in an effort to\nprevent future U.S. oil shortages and said oil drilling in the\nlarge Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska proved oil could be drilled\nwithout severely damaging the environment.\n    He said the Caribou herd at Prudhoe Bay had tripled,\ncontrary to concerns before the drilling operation that it\nwould endanger the herd.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
