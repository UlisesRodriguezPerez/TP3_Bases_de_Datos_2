        "TITLE": "U.S. CONSERVATION FIGURES SEEN NEUTRAL/BEARISH",
        "AUTHOR": "    By Brian Killen, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    CHICAGO, March 13 - ",
        "BODY": "U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA)\nfigures for highly-erodible land enrolled into the Conservation\nReserve Program were regarded by most grain analysts as neutral\nto bearish, although some said a full state-by-state breakdown\nwould be needed to assess the full price impact.\n    \"Out of 10.5 mln acres only 1.9 mln acres were accepted in\ncorn -- That's neutral at best and perhaps bearish to what the\ntrade was looking for,\" Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham\nLambert said.\n    The USDA said it had accepted 10,572,402 more acres into\nthe conservation program out of bids on a total of 11,254,837\nacres.\n    Gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate of\nplanted acreage for corn as a result of the latest figures, but\nsome other analysts said they would adjust their estimates\nslightly. The USDA is due to release planting intentions\nfigures March 31.\n    Indications of a heavy sign-up in the conservation program\nrecently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreage\nto 63.0 to 67.0 mln acres from 67.0 to 69.0 mln.\n    Richard Loewy, analyst with Prudential Bache Securities,\nsaid there was not enough information to completely assess the\nconservation figures. \"The 1.9 mln acres on corn is certainly\ndisappointing,\" he added.\n    The USDA later released the state-by-state breakdown of the\nenrollment figures.\n    Loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative for\nboth new crop corn and soybeans, and might possibly mean an\nupward adjustment in planting intention figures.\n    Asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificates\nonto the market this spring, he said: \"The trade was definitely\nlooking higher, so certificates are going to be less than\nexpected.\"\n    The USDA offered a special corn \"bonus\" rental payment to\nthe farmers to be paid in generic certificates. The bonus\namounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the farm program\npayment yield for corn, for each acre of corn accepted into the\nreserve.\n    Katharina Zimmer, analyst for Merrill Lynch Futures, said\nthe conservation sign-up was slightly higher than she had\nexpected, although she noted that some trade expectations were\nconsiderably higher than the actual figures.\n    \"I think it is friendly for the market, at least in the\nlong run,\" she said.\n    Susan Hackmann of AgriAnalysis said there was some\nconfusion over whether trade ideas of an enrollment figure\nbetween 15 and 18 mln acres referred to the total sign-up or\nthe latest addition.\n    \"It seems the trade was looking for more acres to be bid\ninto the program,\" she said.\n    Hackmann said she would not make much change to her ideas\nabout corn planting figures as a result of the conservation\nsign-up. She added that while some trade guesses were as low as\n61 mln acres, she was looking for corn plantings to be in the\nhigh 60's.\n    Zimmer of Merrill Lynch said she would be making a slight\nreduction of about one mln acres in her planting estimate to\naround 64 mln acres.\n    New crop corn prices at the Chicago Board of Trade firmed\nearlier this week on ideas of a large sign-up in the program,\ndespite the fact that acres enrolled are generally poor\nyielding and not likely to make a substantial difference to\nfinal production figures.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
