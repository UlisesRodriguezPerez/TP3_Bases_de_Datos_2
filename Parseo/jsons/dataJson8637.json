        "BODY": "Philippine Secretary of\nTrade and Industry Jose Concepcion, who two days ago expressed\ndoubts about agreements produced at international conferences,\nsaid he was pleased with the latest gathering here.\n    Concepcion told Reuters in an interview that the informal\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting gave\nministers from more than 20 nations the chance to examine\nissues with which GATT did not have the political will to deal.\n    \"Also, the role of the developing countries has been\nemphasised in this particular meeting. Somehow it has been the\nperception of developing countries that GATT is a club of rich\ncountries,\" he added in an interview with Reuters.\n    \"In fact many of the issues that have been tabled for\ndiscussion (in the Uruguay round of trade negotiations) will be\nof more benefit to the developed countries,\" he said.\n    Concepcion said at the start of the Taupo meeting that the\nUruguay round was meant to be a \"shining act of faith\" in the\nworld trade system.\n    Concepcion said the Philippines would address the issues of\ntrade in tropical fruit and the improvement of GATT machinery\nto make it more responsive.\n    He said tropical fruit came from developing countries but\nfaced non-tariff barriers, quantitative restrictions or very\nhigh duties in other nations. Concepcion named Japan and South\nKorea as examples.\n    He said he would go to Wellington for talks with New\nZealand, which had a surplus in trade with the Philippines, to\nencourage it to switch imports from other countries. He noted\nthat New Zealand bought its bananas from Ecuador.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
