        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, April 2 - ",
        "BODY": "Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWL.L> said new\nproposals unveiled by Japan for it to become a core member of a\nmerged telecommunications firm to compete for\ntelecommunications contracts did not remove the group's\nobjections.\n    The suggestions by Federation of Economic Organisations\nofficial Fumio Watanabe was a formal announcement of proposals\nmade earlier this week and reported in the Japanese press.\n    Cable has a 20 pct stake in one of the two groups trying to\ncompete against Japan's <Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd> which\nmonopolises Japan's overseas telephone business.\n    But a Cable spokesman said it still believed a merger of\nthe two consortia would be impracticable. \"They are like oil and\nwater,\" he said.\n    The Japanese authorities want only one competitor and have\nproposed that the two consortia band together. The issue has\nbeen taken up by the British government as a test case on the\nopenness of Japanese markets. Watanabe's latest proposals said\nthat the eight core companies of the new group should have\nequal share holdings but added that they could work out the\nprecise percentages amongst themselves.\n    The reports earlier this week said that Cable would be\noffered a five pct stake, up from an originally proposed three\npct.\n    Despite the apparent differences in stakes offered, the\nCable spokesman said the two offers appeared to be essentially\nthe same.\n    Cable shares at 1100 GMT were quoted nine pence firmer at\n374p.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
