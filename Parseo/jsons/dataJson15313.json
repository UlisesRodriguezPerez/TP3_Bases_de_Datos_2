        "BODY": "Canada plans to monitor steel shipments\nflowing in and out of the country in an attempt to appease\nconcerns in the U.S. over the high level of Canadian steel\nexports, Trade Minister Pat Carney said.\n    \"To help maintain our open access to the U.S. steel market,\nthe government is taking further action to ensure we have more\naccurate data on exports and imports and that Canada is not\nused as a backdoor to the U.S. market by offshore suppliers,\"\nCarney said.\n    Carney also said Canadian companies were being asked to\nexercise prudence in the U.S. market and both countries were\nconsidering establishing a joint commission to study the\ngrowing steel problem.\n    Carney told the House of Commons she will soon announce an\namendment to the Exports and Imports Permits Act to set up the\nmonitoring program.\n    Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pct\ncent of the U.S. market in recent months, almost double the\nlevel just two years ago, Canadian trade officials said.\n    The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time of\ngrowing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports from\nseveral countries in the face of a decline in the domestic\nsteel industry.\n    Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed Canada's share of the\nAmerican market be limited to 2.4 pct.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
