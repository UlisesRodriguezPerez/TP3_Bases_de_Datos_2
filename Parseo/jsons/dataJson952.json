        "BODY": "Opec remains within its agreed output\nceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day, and had expected current\nfluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs, Indonesian\nEnergy Minister Subroto said.\n    He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that\npresent weakness in the spot oil market was the result of\nwarmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for\noil.\n    Prices had also been forced down because refineries were\nusing up old stock, he said.\n    He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production\nceiling. Asked what Opec's output level was now, he replied:\n\"Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day).\" He did not elaborate.\n    He said there appeared to have been some attempts to\nmanipulate the market, but if all Opec members stick by the\ncartel's December pricing agreement it would get through\npresent price difficulties.\n    He predicted that prices would recover again in the third\nand fourth quarters of 1987.\n    He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency\nOpec meeting.\n    He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the\nspot price. \"We hope the weak price will be overcome, and\npredict the price will be better in the third and fourth\nquarters.\"\n    Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock\ndeliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price\nto fall. But Opec would get through this period if members\nstuck together.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
