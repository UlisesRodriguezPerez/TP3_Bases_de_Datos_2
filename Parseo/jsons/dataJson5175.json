        "BODY": "Taiwan is not expected to export sugar\nthis year because of falling production and growing domestic\nconsumption, state-owned Taiwan Sugar Corp said.\n    A company spokesman told Reuters this will be the first\ntime in more than 40 years Taiwan has not exported sugar. Last\nyear, sugar exports totalled 149,755 tonnes.\n    He said the actual production during the 1986/87 season\n(November/May) is about 480,000 tonnes, barely enough to meet\nlocal consumption. This compares with actual 1985/86 output of\n570,000. He said the production fall was due to typhoon damage\nto more than 6,000 hectares of canefields last year.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
