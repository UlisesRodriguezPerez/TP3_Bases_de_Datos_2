        "BODY": "General Public Utilities Corp\nsaid its board declared a dividend of 15 cts per share on\ncommon stock, its first dividend since it omitted payment in\nFebruary 1980 as a result of the Three Mile Island nuclear\naccident in 1979.\n    The company said it was able to declare the dividend due to\nprogress in the cleanup of Three Mile Island Unit Two.\n    A company spokesman said GPU expects to continue declaring\ndividends on a quarterly basis, with the rate depending on the\nprogress of the cleanup and on other company operations.\n    GPU said the dividend is of \"modest size,\" representing\nless than a third of the amount paid as a dividend by the\naverage electric utility.\n    \"As the operating companies need to return to the capital\nmarkets for debt and preferred stock, this should tend to\nproduce lower cost and better terms,\" the company said.\n    The dividend is payable May 29 to holders of record April\n24.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
