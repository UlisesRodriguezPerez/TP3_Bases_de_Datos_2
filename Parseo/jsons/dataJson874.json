        "BODY": "The government's industry aid and\nprotection review body, the Industries Assistance Commission\n(IAC), will hold a 12-month inquiry into the Australian wheat\nindustry, Primary Industry Minister John Kerin said.\n    The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistance\nto the industry and the nature, duration and extent of any aid,\nhe said in a statement.\n    He said the inquiry will be the first step in setting\nmarketing arrangements to apply after June 30, 1989, when the\nunderwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat Marketing\nAct expire.\n    Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a full\nexamination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system.\n    \"The inquiry will be required to take into account changes\nwhich have taken place in the industry as a result of the\nagricultural policies of major wheat producing countries and\nthe industry's capacity to adjust to any recommended changes,\"\nhe said.\n    \"The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry,\nas the substantial fall in world prices is likely to trigger\nunderwriting support from the government for the first time,\" he\nsaid.\n    Kerin was referring to the government's underwriting of the\nguaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the Australian\nWheat Board near the start of the season.\n    The IAC's report will be due at the same time as the\nfindings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage,\nHandling and Transport, Kerin said.\n    He said the timing of the IAC inquiry would allow its\nfindings and those of the Royal Commission to be considered in\nlater negotiations on wheat-marketing arrangements between the\nfederal and state governments and the industry.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
