        "BODY": "Indonesia's coffee production in\n1986/87 ending September 30 may fall slightly from last year's\nlevel of 360,000 tonnes, Dharyono Kertosastro, chairman of the\nAssociation of Indonesian Coffee Exporters told Reuters.\n    He said shade trees had been damaged by pests and this may\nhave affected the crop, though it remains to be seen how\nseriously. Indonesia's main crop is harvested next month.\n    He gave no figure for expected output, except to say it\nwould probably be down a little from 1985/86. He said stocks\nwere about normal at 90,000 tonnes.\n    Kertosastro predicted that exports were unlikely to rise\nmuch from last year's level of 320,000 tonnes. \"I expect exports\nwill be a bit more, maybe 330,000 tonnes, but not above that,\"\nhe said. Exports in 1985/86 were valued at 944 mln U.S. Dlrs,\nbut the value could fall by 30 pct this year because of low\nprices, he added.\n    Dharyono said production was behind a five year plan target\nof 420,000 tonnes for the current year, but Indonesia is trying\nto boost output through introduction of higher yielding seeds,\nbetter training for farmers and increased use of fertilizers.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
