The 1987 target is 617 million.\n    Dinkov said the Soviet Union would develop 38 new oil\ndeposits in the coming year. He called for speedier geolog\nprospecting across the country to spur the oil industry.\n    The Supreme Soviet convened on Monday to endorse the 1988\nbudget and plan. The session is expected to end on Tuesday.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
