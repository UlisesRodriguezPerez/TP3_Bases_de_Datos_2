        "DATELINE": "    ISLAMABAD, June 2 - ",
        "BODY": "Pakistan says its economy has continued\nits recent outstanding performance during the financial year\n1986/87 ending on June 30 but areas like balance of payments,\ninvestments and energy were causing concern.\n    GDP grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980\nand the inflation rate was the lowest since 1969/70, according\nto a government economic survey.\n     The reform of economic regulation had gathered momentum\nand there was an impressive performance in a five point\ngovernment program for rural uplift, education and poverty\nalleviation, said the survey.\n    Ministry Economic Adviser Qazi Alimullah told a news\nconference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms\ndamaged the wheat crop, GDP growth was calculated at 7.04 pct\ncompared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.He said the figure might now\nslide down a little to around 6.8 or 6.9 pct.\n    The survey said monetary expansion was estimated to be nine\npct to date but might rise to around 12 pct by the year-end.\n    Alimullah said exports rose 18 pct to 3.5 billion dlrs from\n2.9 billion dlrs in 1985/86. But the at the same time, home\nremittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrs\nfrom the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion.\n    More exports and an improvement in the balance of payments\nsituation will be required to overcome this declining trend in\nhome remittances, he said.\n    The survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to\n2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because of\nthe boost in exports.\n    He said national investment continued to be small because\nof a poor rate of savings, about 14 pct of GDP. He said more\nsavings were required to maintain or possibly step up the\npresent growth rate and to finance the country's seventh\nfive-year development plan to be launched in July 1988.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
