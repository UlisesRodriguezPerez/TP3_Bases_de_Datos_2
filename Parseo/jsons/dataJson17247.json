        "BODY": "A top United Arab Emirates (UAE)\nbanker said a new law would be introduced soon obliging courts\nto recognise interest rates contracted between bank and\nborrower.\n    Sheikh Suroor bin Sultan al-Dhahiri, Chairman of Abu Dhabi\nCommercial Bank, told reporters after the shareholders' meeting\nlast night the decree would make interest in debt cases payable\nat the contracted rate up to the day a case is filed in court.\n    Subsequently, interest would be charged at a maximum nine\npct for personal and 12 pct for corporate loans, he said.\n    The law, if passed, would mark a breakthrough in solving\nwhat UAE bankers say is one of their biggest problems,\ncollecting bad debts in court.\n    Under current UAE law in all emirates, except Dubai, courts\nrecognise only simple interest at a maximum nine and 12 pct\neven if a loan was contracted at higher compounded rates.\n    The Central Bank said last year that roughly a quarter of\ntotal loans in the UAE banking system were non-performing.\nSheikh Suroor also said a judicial committee set up to consider\ndebt cases would begin functioning within a month.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
