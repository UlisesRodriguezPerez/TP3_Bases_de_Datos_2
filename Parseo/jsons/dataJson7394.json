        "BODY": "Liberalization of Italy's foreign exchange\ncontrols should be \"gradual\" but also \"reasonably rapid,\" a report\nissued by a study committee nominated by the Italian Treasury\nMinistry said.\n   The report, looking at the country's financial development\nprospects, said Italy's large public sector deficit and growing\npublic debt were among the considerations that made a gradual\nliberalization preferable.\n    The report also favoured retention of the lira's six pct\noscillation band with the European Monetary System (EMS) during\nthe liberalization process in order to lessen short-term\ndomestic interest rate fluctuations which could result from\nportfolio adjustments.\n    The lira's fluctuation margin is currently significantly\nhigher than that allowed for other EMS currencies.\n    Italy has over recent months announced a series of\nderegulation moves in response to a European Community\ndirective aimed at creating a genuine common market in goods,\nservices and finance by 1992.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
