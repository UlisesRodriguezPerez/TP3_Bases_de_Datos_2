        "DATELINE": "    BUDAPEST, April 13 - ",
        "BODY": "Hungary has announced sharp price\nincreases for a range of food and consumer products as part of\nits efforts to curb a soaring budget deficit.\n    The official MTI news agency said the government decided\nconsumer price subsidies had to be cut to reduce state\nspending. From today the price of meat will rise by an average\n18 pct and that of beer and spirits by 10 pct, MTI said.\n    MTI said consumer goods will also become more expensive,\nwith the price of refrigerators rising some five pct. It also\nannounced a number of measures to ease hardship, including\nhigher pensions and family allowances.\n    Statistics indicate the budget deficit tripled in 1986 to\n47 billion forints. Central banker Janos Fekete has said the\nFinance Ministry is trying to cut the 1987 shortfall to between\n30 and 35 billion from a planned 43.8 billion.\n    A major tax reform, including the introduction of a\nWestern-style valued added tax, is planned for January 1988 in\nan effort to cure problems in state spending.\n    But diplomats said the latest announcement shows the\nauthorities were forced to act quickly to keep this year's\ndeficit under control.\n    The measures are also aimed at cooling an overheated\neconomy, and could help dampen Hungarians' appetite for\nimported Western goods which consume increasingly expensive\nhard currency, the diplomats said.\n    The diplomats also said, however, that they did not expect\nthe kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in\nother East Bloc states, notably Poland.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
