        "BODY": "Saudi crude oil output last month fell\nto an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd\nin January, Gulf oil sources said.\n    They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah\nterminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month\nfrom 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some\ncustomers.\n    But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf\nexports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd\nfrom 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said.\n    The production figures include neutral zone output but not\nsales from floating storage, which are generally considered\npart of a country's output for Opec purposes.\n    Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a\nproduction restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group\nlast December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs\na barrel.\n    The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week\nappeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February\nentitlements before the month-end.\n    Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued\nsupport for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude\ncustomers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said.\n    The four -- Exxon Corp <XON>, Mobil Corp <MOB>, Texaco Inc\n<TX> and Chevron Corp <CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement\nlast month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel.\n    However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's\nability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will\ncome this month, when demand for petroleum products\ntraditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent\nweeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels.\n    Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday\nreiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord\nand said it would never sell below official prices.\n    The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell\nslightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in\nJanuary because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export\nrefineries.\n    They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd\nlast month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at\nBahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady\nat around 200,000 bpd each.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
