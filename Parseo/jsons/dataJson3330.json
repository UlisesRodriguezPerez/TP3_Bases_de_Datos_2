        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 9 - ",
        "BODY": "The U.S. Agriculture Department\nincreased its estimate of Soviet 1986/87 grain imports to 26\nmln tonnes from last month's projection of 23 mln tonnes.\n    In its monthly USSR Grain Situation and Outlook, USDA said\nthe increase reflected the return of the Soviet Union to the\nU.S. corn market and continued purchases of both wheat and\ncoarse grain from other major suppliers.\n    USSR wheat imports were projected at 15 mln tonnes, up one\nmln from last month's estimate and 700,000 tonnes below the\npreliminary 1985/86 figure.\n    Soviet grain for feed use was estimated at a record 129 mln\ntonnes. Record or near-record livestock inventories, along with\na dry fall which likely reduced late season pasturage, and a\ncold winter have increased feed demand, USDA said.\n    USSR meat and egg production in January rose only slightly\nfrom the previous January's level, while milk production\nincreased by nearly six pct.\n    Unusually cold weather in January and smaller increases in\nroughage supplies during 1986 than in 1985 kept livestock\nproduction from expanding as much as it did a year earlier,\nUSDA said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
