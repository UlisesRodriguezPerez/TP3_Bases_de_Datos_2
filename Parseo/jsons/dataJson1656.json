        "DATELINE": "    CHICAGO, March 4, - ",
        "BODY": "South Korea's record 7.1 billion dlrs\ntrade surplus with the U.S. is bound to diminish as the\ncountry switches purchases from Japan in favor of U.S.\ncompanies, Trade Minister Woong-Bae Rha said.\n     He rejected suggestions the Korean Won is undervalued, and\ndenied any plans for a \"drastic and sudden\" revaluation.\n    Rha is heading a trade mission to 37 U.S. cities. Last year\nSouth Korea ran a 4.3 billion dlr trade surplus, including a\nrecord 7.1 billion surplus with the U.S. and a 5.5 billion dlr\ndeficit with Japan.\n    Rha told Reuters in an interview the current trade mission\nis looking for 2.0 billion dlrs in purchases from U.S.\ncompanies, about a quarter of which represents \"transferred\npurchases from Japanese sources.\"\n    Rha said the items being sought by the current mission are\n\"mainly chemicals, machinery and parts.\"\n    He said South Korea is the fourth largest importer of U.S.\nagricultural products. The current mission is not involved in\nthat area but there are plans to buy \"substantial amounts of\ncotton\" from the U.S.\n    He noted his country \"is clearly not as open as the American\nmarket. Nor is it reasonable to expect that it should be,\"\nconsidering South Korea has a 40 billion dlr foreign debt and\nspends six pct of its gross national product on defense.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
