        "BODY": "Member states of the European\nCommunity are starting to run out of patience with Japan which\nthey believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open\nits market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.\n    Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC\ncountries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the\nwillingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese\ngovernment to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.\n    However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as\nEC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.\n   Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to\nan EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could\nraise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.\nCarries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.\n    The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations\nentered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed\nto stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of\nthe U.S.\n    The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's\ntrade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in\nMarch, up from 1.94 billion in February.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
