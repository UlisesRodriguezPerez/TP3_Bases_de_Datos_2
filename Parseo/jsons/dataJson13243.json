        "BODY": "British Chancellor of the\nExchequer Nigel Lawson said the next U.K. Election was not the\nonly element standing in the way of full British membership of\nthe European Monetary System (EMS).\n    But he added that arguments against joining had weakened.\n    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, widely believed to be the\nstrongest government opponent of full EMS membership, has made\nclear she does not expect to consider joining until after the\nnext UK election, due by mid-1988 at the latest.\n    But Lawson, in answer to a question, told reporters after\nan informal European Community finance ministers' meeting here\nthat other factors apart from the upcoming election stood in\nthe way of full membership.\n    In addition to the question of the exchange rates at which\nBritain should enter the EMS's core exchange rate mechanism,\nthere was also the impact of sterling membership on the system\nto be considered, he said.\n    British entry would change the EMS from a monopolar system\nbased on the West German mark to a bipolar mark-sterling\nsystem, he noted. \"We have to make sure it would work.\"\n    But Lawson added that some of the considerations that had\nmade it difficult for Britain to join in the past now posed\nless of a problem.\n    As an example he cited sterling's role as a petrocurrency,\nwhich he said was diminishing. \"That argument has clearly\nweakened,\" he said.\n    Lawson restated that the government was keeping the\nquestion of membership under review.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
