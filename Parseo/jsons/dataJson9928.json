        "DATELINE": "    SADDLE BROOK, N.J., March 26 - ",
        "BODY": "Michigan General Corp said\nit agreed to sell substantially all of the assets and certain\nliabilities of its Krestmark subsidiaries to LCB Holdings Inc\nfor 6.5 mln dlrs cash.\n    Sale of Texas-based Krestmark, a maker of doors, door\nframes and other products, will allow Michigan General to\nconcentrate on retailing through its Diamond Lumber and\nSavannah Wholesale units.\n    Proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce debt. The deal\nis subject to execution of a definitive agreement.\n    Krestmark had revenues of about 40 mln dlrs and operating\nlosses of three mln dlrs in 1986, the company said. It has been\naccounted for as a discontinued operation since last September.\n    Dallas-based LCB is a privately-held maker of structural\nsteel joists and rack and storage handling systems.\n    Michigan General also said its Diamond Lumber homebuilding\nproducts retail unit closed nine unprofitable stores in the\nfirst quarter and reduced its headquarters staff by 10 pct. The\nnine closed stores, which had pretax operating losses of 1.7\nmln dlrs in 1986, are being sold to provide cash for\noperations.\n    About 4.5 mln dlrs of inventory from the stores is being\ntransferred to other locations, the company said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
