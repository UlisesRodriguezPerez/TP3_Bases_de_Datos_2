        "BODY": "The Bank of England said it had invited\nan early round of bill offers from the discount houses after\nforecasting a shortage of around 1.2 billion stg in the money\nmarket today.\n    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills for\nrepurchase by the market will drain some 526 mln stg while\nbills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury\nbills will remove around 1.79 billion stg. A rise in note\ncirculation will take out a further 105 mln stg.\n    Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions\nwill add around 1.01 billion stg and bankers' balances above\ntarget some 185 mln stg.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
