        "BODY": "The Senate this week might take up\nproposed legislation that could serve as a lightning rod to\nexpose broad initiatives to change U.S. farm policy.\n    The Senate could consider a House-passed bill that would\nallow wheat and feedgrains farmers to receive at least 92 pct\nof their income support payments if flooding last year\nprevented, or will prevent, them from planting their 1987\ncrops, Senate staff members told Reuters.\n    Also pending is a bill extend the life of the National\nCommission on Dairy Policy.\n    Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., intends to offer an amendment\nto one of the bills that would suspend the minimum planting\nrequirement for all 1987 wheat, feedgrain, cotton and rice\nproducers, an aide said.\n    Under current law, producers must plant at least 50 pct of\ntheir base acreage to be eligible for 92 pct of their\ndeficiency payments.\n    Most major U.S. farm groups have lobbied hard against\nmaking any fundamental changes in the 1985 farm bill out of\nfear a full-scale debate could expose agricultural problems to\nbudget-cutting pressures.\n    Representatives of these farm groups have said they also\nfear efforts by Midwestern Democrats to force a floor vote on a\nbill that would require large acreage set-asides in return for\nsharply higher support prices.\n    However, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, sponsor of the bill, told\nReuters he did not intend to offer his measure as a floor\namendment but to bring it through the committee.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
