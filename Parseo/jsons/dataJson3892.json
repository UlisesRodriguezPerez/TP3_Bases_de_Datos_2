        "BODY": "Mario Branco Peres, president of\nthe Brazilian Association of Citrus Juice Industries\n(Abrassuco), welcomed a decision by the U.S. Commerce\nDepartment sharply cutting its duties on imported frozen\nconcentrated orange juice (FCOJ) from Brazil.\n    Speaking by telephone from Sao Paulo, Peres said, \"With its\ndecision, the U.S. government recognised the honesty of\nBrazilian exporters, who never have the intention of practising\ndumping.\"\n    In a final ruling yesterday, the U.S. government eliminated\nthe duties shipped by Sucocitrico Cutrale and cut to 1.96 pct\nthe duty on Citrosuco. Duties of 8.54 pct had been set last\nOctober.\n    Peres said Brazil had enough orange juice to meet the needs\nof its major clients.\n    \"We do not have in stock what we would like to have, but we\ncertainly have enough orange juice available to supply our\nbuyers,\" Peres said, declining to estimate the amount of the\ncurrent stock. \"To keep it a secret is part of our strategy,\" he\nadded.\n    Peres said the price policy of the orange juice was based\non market conditions.\n    \"There is nothing better than a free trade policy,\" he said.\n    Cutrale and Citrosuco officials were not immediately\navailable for comment.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
