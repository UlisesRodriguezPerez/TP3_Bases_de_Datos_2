        "DATELINE": "    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 20 - ",
        "BODY": "The European Community's farmers'\npressure group Copa has urged EC farm ministers to agree a tax\non vegetable proteins similar to the oils and marine fats tax\nwhich has already been proposed by the EC Commission.\n    Copa president Hans Kjeldsen told a news conference on\nTuesday he had also urged ministers to seek a similar mechanism\nfor cereal substitutes.\n    He was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with the\nDanish foreign and agriculture ministers, who currently chair\nmeetings of their EC colleagues.\n    Kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would help\nthe EC's budget problems and would provide some price stability\nfor producers.\n    This would in turn help the market position for certain\ncrops of which the EC is a net importer such as oilseeds, peas\nand beans, but for which the Commission is now proposing severe\noutput restrictions.\n    A minority of EC ministers opposed to an oils and fats tax\non imported and domestically produced oils and marine fats\nsucceeded in blocking the idea during this year's annual EC\nprice fixing.\n    However, the EC Commission has said it maintains its\nproposals for a tax.\n    Kjeldsen said Copa had urged the ministers to pursue\ninternational negotiations on farm trade with the aim of\nbridging the gap between EC and world prices.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
