        "DATELINE": "    CHICAGO, June 19 - ",
        "BODY": "The six basis point rise of the past\nmonth in U.S. debt futures may be extended next week by a\nseries of U.S. economic reports, analysts said, as long as the\ndollar holds firm.\n    \"Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basis\npoints over the last month, largely over indications that\ninflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowing\nU.S. trade balance, in nominal terms,\" Samuel Kahan, chief\nfinancial economist with Kleinwort Benson Government\nSecurities, said.\n    Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in\nthe economy during the first quarter, but his concern is\nwhether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in the\nlonger term.\n    Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which has\nbecome more important to the direction of debt futures than the\nbeneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy.\n    The median trade expectations for Tuesday's U.S. Consumer\nPrice Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down\n1.5 pct, respectively.\n    Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 money\nsupply announced this week was \"surprising, much larger than\nexpected,\" according to Kahan. \"Unless quickly reversed,\" such\na trend \"will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,\"\nKahan said.\n    Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates which\nKahan said have \"slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Board\nannual targets,\" the consequences could be a hint of economic\nweakness down the road, he said.\n    Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised for\nfurther gains, although the advance has been slowed recently,\nanalysts said.\n    September T-bonds \"are up almost six points since about May\n18,\" Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. September\nbond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93\nin mid-June, Duggan said.\n    While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far,\nand bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through\nchart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwarted\nabove the 93 level.\n    \"The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken\nout before this activity is anything other than a trading range\nmarket,\" Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analyst\nBrian Singer said.\n    The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S.\ncurrency has made little headway of late, analysts said.\n    \"The critical variable remaining in the market is the value\nof the dollar,\" Kahan said.\n    Additional influences next week will be possible\ndevelopments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impact\nand size of the U.S. budget deficit, \"although these will not\nbe in the forefront of the market early next week,\" Kahan said.\n    In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refunding\nauctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday and\nThursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the results\nwith little excitement. However, a successful auction could\nprove to be a turning point, depending on prevailing market\npsychology.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
