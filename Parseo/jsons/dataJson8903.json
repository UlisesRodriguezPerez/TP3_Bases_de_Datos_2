        "BODY": "Colombia's coffee export revenue dropped\n97 mln dlrs to 233.6 mln dlrs for the first two months of the\nyear against 330.9 mln dlrs in the similar period of 1986,\ncentral bank preliminary figures show.\n    Experts attributed the fall to lower world market prices\nfollowing the failure to re-introduce international coffee\nexport quotas, but they said Colombia could compensate the drop\nwith higher exports in calendar 1987.\n    Coffee export revenue for 1986 was 2.33 billion dlrs,\naccording to the bank.\n    Jorge Cardenas, manager of the National Coffee Growers'\nFederation, last week estimated the recent drop of 30 cents a\nlb in coffee prices would mean a net loss revenue of 457 mln\ndlrs for Colombia.\n    But he stressed that Colombia, with stockpiles of 10 mln\n(60-kg) bags, had the capacity to export more and would use a\nrecently-introduced more flexible marketing policy to do so.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
