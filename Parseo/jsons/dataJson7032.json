        "DATELINE": "    PARIS, March 19 - ",
        "BODY": "There is no question of stimulating\nconsumption or relying on a systematic budget deficit or other\nreflationary policies to boost the French economy, sources\nclose to finance minister Edouard Balladur said.\n    Their comments followed remarks by prime minister Jacques\nChirac's spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said on Monday ministers\nwere agreed on the desirability of \"relaunching\" the economy.\n    This sparked speculation the government was preparing for a\nreflationary U-turn, but the finance ministry immediately ruled\nout any such move.\n    The sources today said the government's policy remained one\nof \"recovery,\" or sound finances and greater efficiency.\n    They said that while 8.6 billion of the 30 billion franc\nrevenues expected for 1987 from a sweeping privatisation\nprogram will go to providing public companies with fresh\ncapital, 21.4 billion francs, or two-thirds, will go toward\npaying off national debt.\n    Any further privatisation revenue this year above the 30\nbillion would be distributed between repayment of national\ninternal debt and public companies in similar proportions, they\nadded.\n    The sources said it was absurd to talk of reflation when\nthe country's internal debt, expected to grow by 10 pct this\nyear from 1,300 billion francs in 1986 was growing twice as\nfast as gross domestic product.\n    Nominal GDP is expected to grow by roughly five pct this\nyear from 5,000 billion francs last year, broadly in line with\nearlier forecasts. Real GDP will grow by up to 2.5 pct.\n    The sources said that with France's economic targets for\n1987 roughly in line with its main trading partners, the\ngovernment had no intention of pushing the economy to grow at\nan artificial pace out of step with neighbouring economies.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
