        "BODY": "<Hawker Siddeley Canada Inc> said that,\ndue to poor market conditions for railway freight car\nmanufacturing, it plans to sell its Trenton Works division in\nTrenton, Nova Scotia.\n    Hawker Siddeley said it set aside a provision of 7.7 mln\ndlrs for the proposed sale.\n    It also said lower 1986 earnings were due to much lower\nearnings in transportation equipment and losses in steel\ncastings and forgings, which offset gains in the mining sector\nand improvements in forestry equipment.\n    Hawker Siddeley also said demand for new railway equipment\nwas limited with export sales frequently restrained by\ncustomers' financing difficulties.\n    Demand for steel castings and wheels for Canadian railways\ncontinued to be very depressed with maintenance requirements at\nthe lowest level in the past decade.\n    However, there was demand for industrial casting due to\nincreased hydro-electric power generation, the company said.\n    The company said manufacturing of mining machinery and\ntunnelling equipment showed greatly improved results in the\nU.S. and export markets, mainly China and India.\n    The Orenda division maintained a high level of activity in\naircraft engine repair and overhaul and in the manufacture of\nengine components.\n    Sawmill equipment and skidder operations were affected by a\nstrike in British Columbia and the extended debate on U.S.\nimports of Canadian lumber, but there were encouraging signs at\nyearend, the company said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
