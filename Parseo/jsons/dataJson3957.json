        "BODY": "Alcoa officials acknowledged the\npossibility that they may have a position in the off-exchange\naluminum options market, but declined specific comment on trade\nspeculation that the company is holding a large outstanding\nposition.\n    An Alcoa (Aluminum Company of America) source involved in\nterminal trading for the company said: \"We use all means\navailable to manage our business, so it's a possibility we're\ntrading options.\"\n    \"We won't go into specifics about what we're doing. But\nwhen you're dealing in un-alloyed ingot, it's a commodity\nbusiness where there are a lot of tools available (for hedging)\nand Alcoa is using all of those tools,\" said Al Posti, Alcoa's\nmanager of corporate news.\n    Trade sources have said Alcoa is long call options equal to\n30,000 to 50,000 tonnes of aluminum due to mature in April and\nMay. However, some New York-based aluminium traders said they\nbelieve the size of Alcoa's position has been exaggerated.\n    The possibility that Alcoa may be long call options is one\nfactor indicating that supply tightness may worsen in the\nsecond quarter, traders said.\n    \"If they decide to exercise their right to buy, it would\nmean really squeezing the market,\" one New York trader said,\nnoting that aluminum stocks on the London Metal Exchange were\n90,500 tonnes at the end of last week.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
