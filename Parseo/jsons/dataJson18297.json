        "BODY": "After a highly favorable reception of\na trial batch of bread baked from 300 lbs of U.S. wheat flour\nlast February, the Senegalese appear ready to take delivery of\na first tranche of 10,500 tonnes of mixed U.S. wheat, the U.S.\nAgriculture Department said.\n    In its report on U.S. Export Markets for U.S. Grain, the\ndepartment noted Senegal had bought 100,000 tonnes of wheat\nunder the Export Enhancement Program last November, but local\nopposition from millers, accustomed to French wheat, has been\ndelaying deliveries.\n    As a result there were a series of baking seminars as well\nas the trial batch, in an effort to satisfy local flour millers\nand convince key officials of the qualities of U.S. wheat.\n    The department said if deliveries of U.S. wheat to Senegal\nremain on track, the U.S. could dominate a wheat market that\nhad been expected to import 140,000 tonnes of mostly French\nwheat during the 1987/88 (July-June) season.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003"
