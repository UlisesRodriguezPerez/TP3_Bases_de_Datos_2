        "TITLE": "SOAKING RAINS BOOST DRY AUSTRALIAN SUGAR CANE AREA",
        "DATELINE": "    SYDNEY, April 27 - ",
        "BODY": "Good soaking rain is boosting the sugar\ncane crop in the key Mackay region of Queensland following a\nprolonged dry spell relieved only by intermittent falls, an\nAustralian Sugar Producers Association spokesman told Reuters.\n    The rains began late last week, developed into heavy\ndownpours over the weekend and are continuing today, he said\nfrom Brisbane.\n    The Mackay and Burdekin regions, which together grow about\nhalf the Australian cane crop, have been the Queensland cane\nareas hardest hit by unseasonal dry weather since December.\n    The spokesman said the rain missed the Burdekin area, just\nto the north of the Mackay region on the central Queensland\ncoastal fringe, although recent light showers have freshened\nthe crop there.\n    Owing to the dry spell in the Mackay and Burdekin areas,\nthe overall 1987 Australian cane crop is likely to be below the\n25.4 mln tonnes crushed in 1986 for a 94 net titre raws outturn\nof 3.37 mln tonnes, he said.\n    But any decline will not be as great as seemed likely a\ncouple of months ago when it appeared the Mackay-Burdekin crops\nwere going to suffer badly, he said.\n    Preliminary crop estimates are expected to be available\nearly next month, the spokesman said.\n    The crush in the Mackay-Burdekin is likely to start later\nthis year, in late June or early July against mid-June last\nyear, to allow the cane to grow and sweeten further, he said.\n    The crush normally runs to around the end of December.\n    Elsewhere in the sugar belt, the cane is doing well, with\nsome mill areas expecting record crops, he said.\n    Industry records show variations in the crop are not always\nmirrored in raws output. In 1985, 24.4 mln tonnes of sweeter\ncane than in 1986 produced 3.38 mln tonnes of raws.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
