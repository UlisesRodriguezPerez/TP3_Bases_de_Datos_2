        "BODY": "Calumet Industries Inc said it expects\nto report a loss from operations for its second quarter ending\nMarch 31, despite a strong unit sales increase.\n    In the same year-ago period the company reported net income\nof 366,953 dlrs, or 18 cts a share.\n    Chairman S. Mark Salvino said the expected loss is\nprimarily due to depressed product prices not recovering the\nincreasing cost of crude oil.\n    Salvino also said steadier crude prices and the reduced\nrate of refinery production should increase product prices and\nlead to a return to more normal profit margins.\n    He reported that the 23 mln dlr HydroCal II system under\nconstruction at the company's refinery in Princeton, La., is on\nschedule and production will begin early in fiscal 1988.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
