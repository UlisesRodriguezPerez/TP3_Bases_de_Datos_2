        "BODY": "Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita\nsaid there is little room left for the central bank to further\nease its credit policy as interest rates levels are now\napproaching their lower limit.\n    \"The government should instead seek ways of making the best\nuse of its fiscal policy,\" he told a press conference.\n    His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic\nstimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming\ndays.\n    At the recent talks among the six major industrialised\nnations in Paris, Japan promised to work out a comprehensive\neconomic package to boost domestic demand, which in turn would\nhelp increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus.\n    Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in\nthe second half of the year if the yen remains stable.\n    He said there is caution in the foreign exchange market\nagainst a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains\nthe recent stability in the currency markets. Conflicting\neconomic indicators from the U.S. Have also been dampening\nmarket activity, he added.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
