        "TITLE": "U.S. INTERIOR SECRETARY OPPOSES OIL IMPORT FEE",
        "DATELINE": "    LOS ANGELES, April 29 - ",
        "BODY": "U.S. Interior Secretary Donald\nHodel said he does not support an oil import fee as a means to\nstimulate domestic oil and gas production.\n    \"I am an advocate for incentives for exploration,\" Hodel\nsaid, but added, \"I do not favor an oil import fee.\"\n    \"It would inject the federal government so deeply back in\nto the process, we would never get the government out again,\nand I think that would be in the long term disinterest of the\nnation,\" Hodel said in an address to a group of local business\nexecutives.\n    Earlier today, Congressmen from oil producing states\nintroduced a bill that would impose a fee on oil imports.\n    Hodel said he supports drilling incentives, such as repeal\nof the Windfall Profits Tax and Fuel Use Act and deregulation\nof natural gas.\n    The secretary also said oil and gas exploration offshore\nCalifornia and in the Artic National Wildlife Refuge is\nnecessary to prevent the U.S. from becoming too dependent on\nforeign supplies of oil for its energy needs.\n    Failure to approve such exploration, Hodel said, would lead\nto greater U.S. dependence on foreign sources of oil.\n    \"In the next two to five years, no matter what we do today,\nwe are very likely to find the U.S becoming 50 pct or more\ndependent on imports for its oil requirements,\" Hodel said.\n    If OPEC were to raise oil prices sharply, Congress would\nlikely act to have the federal government fix gasoline prices\nand allocate supplies, Hodel said.\n    \"If they allocate supplies you and I, in the same\ntwo-to-five year time frame, could well find ourselves sitting\nback in gas lines,\" Hodel said.\n    Exploration for oil and gas in offshore areas and in the\nArctic National Wildlife Refuge would not jeopardize\nenvironmentally sensitive areas, Hodel said.\n    \"We are convinced we can meet and resolve every\nenvironmental concern that is raised,\" Hodel said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
