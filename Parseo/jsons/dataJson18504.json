        "BODY": "The New Zealand Government will sell\n25 pct of state-owned <Air New Zealand Ltd> to the public,\nCivil Aviation minister Richard Prebble said.\n    Prebble said in a statement the government would appoint an\nadviser to help it decide how the shares should be sold, the\ntiming of any sales and the price.\n    \"Clearly there will be a need to gauge the effect of other\nproposed share issues so as to enter the market at the best\nopportunity,\" Prebble said.\n    \"We are in no particular rush to sell our shares in Air New\nZealand,\" he said.\n    \"Our aim is to maximise the benefit to the taxpayer. If that\nmeans waiting for a while, then so be it,\" Prebble said.\n    He said Air New Zealand expects to release its results soon\nfor the year to March 31 1987. He said he was confident it\nwould post an excellent profit.\n    Prebble said Air New Zealand was successful but its ability\nto prosper in future was hampered by its\nwholly-government-owned status.\n    Prebble said access to new sources of capital would\nincrease its ability to expand and develop.\n    This sale announcement follows the public float in March of\naround 13 pct of the <Bank of New Zealand Ltd>.\n    The government has said it will also float part of the\ncapital of other state-owned operations, including <DFC New\nZealand Ltd>, formerly Development Finance Corp of New Zealand\nLtd, and Petroleum Corp of New Zealand Ltd.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
