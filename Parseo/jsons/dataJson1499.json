        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 4 - ",
        "BODY": "Secretary of Commerce Malcolm\nBaldrige expressed concern about the continuing U.S. trade\ndeficits with South Korea and Taiwan and said that without an\nadjustment in exchange rates there is little likelihood of\nimprovement.\n    Speaking to the President's Export Council, an industry\nadvisory group, Baldrige said the trade deficit issue was under\ndiscussion with those countries.\n    \"I feel that unless we see an exchange rate adjustment we\nprobably won't be able to see much of a change in the large\nsurplus that Taiwan in particular has with us,\" he said.\n    In a wide-ranging discussion on U.S. trade matters,\nBaldrige also repeated U.S. concern about an attempted takeover\nby Japan's Fujitsu company of Fairchild Computer.\n    He said that the Japanese were resisting allowing U.S.\ncompanies into the giant computer business while at the same\ntime attempting to acquire control of a U.S. company that does\nmajor computer business in the U.S. market.\n    Lastly, Baldrige said that the United States was hopeful\nthat it could complete a free market agreement with Canada by\nthe autumn, but said major issues, including acid rain,\nremained unresolved.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
