        "BODY": "Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp will\nlater today formally ask the U.S. Interstate Commerce\nCommission (ICC) to reconsider its earlier rejection of the\nmerger of the holding company's railroad assets, a company\nspokesman said.\n    \"We expect to file papers late tonight\" asking the ICC to\nreopen the rail merger case, spokesman Rich Hall said in a\ntelephone interview from the company's Chicago headquarters.\n    The ICC had rejected in July, on grounds it would reduce\ncompetition, the merger of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific\nRailroads.\n    The deadline for seeking ICC reconsideration of the merger\nplan is midnight tonight.\n    Santa Fe Southern Pacific owns the Santa Fe railroad and\nholds the Southern Pacific railroad assets in trust while\nawaiting federal approval of the merger plan.\n    The ICC had ordered the holding company to divest one or\nthe other railroad but stayed its ruling pending a decision on\nthe request for reconsideration.\n    If the ICC ultimately decides not to reopen the case, it is\nexpected to reinstate the divestiture order.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
