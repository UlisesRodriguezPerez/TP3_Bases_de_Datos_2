        "BODY": "The premiers of Canada's\neastern provinces and the governors of America's New England\nstates urged development of Canada's offshore oil and gas\nfields and construction of a pipeline from Nova Scotia to New\nEngland.\n    Newfoundland premier Brian Peckford, speaking to the annual\nconference of New England and eastern Canadian leaders, said\ndevelopment would prevent a repetition of the energy crisis of\nthe early 1970s.\n    The group also agreed to discuss energy and security of\nsupply next spring.\n    Drilling off Canada's Atlantic coast has stalled since\nworld oil prices began tumbling two years ago. The resolution\nsupporting a natural gas pipeline from Nova Scotia to New\nEngland has been on the agenda for six years, and this is the\nsixth year it has been approved.\n    The two-day conference ends tomorrow.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
