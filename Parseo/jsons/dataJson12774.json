        "BODY": "The Belgian National Bank cut interest\nrates on one, two and three-month treasury certificates to 7.30\npct from 7.40 pct effective immediately, the bank said in a\ntelex message.\n    The Bank last adjusted its short-term treasury certificate\nrates on March 23, when it also reduced rates for all three\nperiods by 0.10 points.\n    A National Bank spokesman said the latest adjustment would\nbring the rates closer in line with currently prevailing\ninterbank interest rates.\n    The spokesman said it was too early to predict whether the\nmove would herald a reduction in discount rate, which currently\nstands at eight pct, when the Bank holds its regular weekly\nmeeting at which the rate is discussed next Wednesday.\n    The discount rate generally moves in tandem with the\nthree-month treasury certificate rate. However, there is no\nformal link and the discount rate was not adjusted following\nthe March 23 changes.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
