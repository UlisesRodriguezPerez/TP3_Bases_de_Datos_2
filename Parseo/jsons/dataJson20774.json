        "BODY": "A new convoy of tankers escorted by\nAmerican warships headed down the Gulf on Wednesday, towards\nIranian oil platforms still oozing smoke after having being\nblasted by U.S. Navy raiders.\n    Some Gulf sea captains were reported to be steering well\nclear of Iran's Silkworm missiles, however, and frontline\nemirate Kuwait redeployed air defences to counter the threat.\n    \"I think the predominant feeling ... Is of being scared this\nconflict will escalate,\" a top West German Foreign Ministry\nofficial, Helmut Schaefer, told reporters in Bahrain after a\ntour of three Gulf states.\nb\n    Shipping sources said on Tuesday night at least six sea\ncaptains had voiced fears that Iran would avenge Monday's U.S.\nRaids by unleashing more Silkworm missiles at ships plying the\nGulf.\n    Belgium decided two minesweepers en route for the Gulf\nwould stay out for the time being following Monday's U.S.\nAction.\n    But there was no sign that the prospect of more tit-for-tat\nassaults had reduced the level of shipping activity in the\narea.\n    Iran, having vowed to react strongly after Monday's U.S.\nAction, launched a barrage of threats and ridicule.\n    For its part, Washington warned Iran again on Tuesday that\nit was ready for any further hostile action.\n    Pentagon officials then announced that a U.S. Guided\nmissile destroyer began escorting two Kuwaiti tankers flying\nthe U.S. flag southwards--the 80,000 tonne product carrier\nOcean City and 46,000 tonne petroleum tanker Gas King.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
