        "DATELINE": "    BRUSSELS, June 18 - ",
        "BODY": "The Belgian National Bank said it cut\none, two, and three month treasury certificate rates, all by\n0.10 points, effective immediately.\n    The cuts take the one month rate to 6.75 pct, the two month\nrate to 6.80 pct and the key three month rate to 6.85 pct, the\ncentral bank said in a telex.\n    A National Bank spokesman said the modest cut was made\nafter a decline in domestic money market rates yesterday, and\nwas not expected to be followed by a cut in the 7.60 pct\ndiscount rate.\n    The short-term treasury certificate rates, and especially\nthe three-month rate, have been the National Bank's main\nmonetary policy instrument for the last two years.\n    The discount rate has been the market's penalty rate rather\nthan a guiding rate since 1985, and its advances are currently\nlittle used as liquidity is ample, bank economists said.\n    The bank last cut one- to three-month certificate rates on\nJune 5, also by 0.10 points.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
