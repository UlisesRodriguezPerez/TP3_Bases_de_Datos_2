        "BODY": "Treasury Secretary James Baker said\nthe agreement among industrial nations in Paris last month is\nonly a start in Washington's drive to intensify economic\ncooperation among leading countries.\n    In a speech to the National Newspaper Association, Baker\nsaid \"the six steps beginning with the Plaza Agreement and\nculminating in the Paris Accord, are only a start.\"\n    He added \"we see our role as a steward of a process in which\nwe sit down with our industrial allies to find ways to promote\nmore balanced international growth.\"\n    The Paris agreements called trade surplus countries to\nstrengthen their growth and on the U.S. to reduce its budget\ndeficit. Under such circumstances, the countries agreed their\ncurrencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic\nfundamentals.\n    Baker also said he still sees \"ominous\" signs of pressure for\nprotectionist trade legislation \"and this pressure for\nprotectionism is coming from new areas of society.\"\n    But he also said he believed a coalition was forming that\nsupported free trade.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
