Toepfer said in\nits latest report.\n    It is too soon to assess the extent of the damage, but it\nis likely that northern West German crops are particularly at\nrisk because of insufficient snow cover, it said.\n    The soil needs to warm up rapidly and moisture content must\nimprove to avoid further delays to spring field work, it added.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
