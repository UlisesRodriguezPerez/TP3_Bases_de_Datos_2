        "BODY": "<SNC Group Inc> expects 1987 earnings\nto rise to 1.20-1.40 dlrs a share from 91 cts a share last\nyear, with revenues climbing to about 430 mln dlrs from last\nyear's 350 mln dlrs, president Alex Taylor said before the\nannual meeting.\n    SNC, Canada's second biggest engineering and construction\ngroup, became the country's largest ammunition manufacturer\nlast year with its 90 mln dlr acquisition of Canadian Arsenals\nLtd from the Canadian government.\n    The impact of that and several smaller deals will be felt\nfully in 1987, Taylor said.\n    Defense preoducts and other manufacturing operations will\naccount for more than half SNC's total 1987 revenues, helping\nto counterbalance the more cyclical engineering and\nconstruction acivities, Taylor said.\n    Last year, SNC earned 8.7 mln dlrs, including a small\nextraordinary gain.\n    In 1987, a total manufacturing activities will generate\nabout 235 mln dlrs in revenues, and engineering and\nconstruction about 200 mln dlrs, he said, adding that defense\nproducts operations should be a major contributor to earnings.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
