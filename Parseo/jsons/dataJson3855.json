        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 11 - ",
        "BODY": "U.S. Senate Republican leader Robert\nDole (R-Kan.) said he and a group of Republican lawmakers are\nconsidering introducing legislation to extend the ethanol tax\nexemption through the year 2000.\n    Dole, addressing the National Corn Growers Association\nboard, said the proposal was under consideration by a rural\ntask force of Republican members of Congress and governors.\n    Gasoline containing at least 10 pct ethanol now receives a\nsix cents per gallon exemption from a nine cent federal excise\ntax. The exemption is to expire the end of 1992.\n    Ethanol is produced primarily by a few large agribusiness\nfirms including Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and A.E. Staley.\nThe tax exemption has helped bolster ethanol production despite\na sharp drop in the prices of competing crude oil.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
