        "BODY": "Canadian gross domestic product should\ngrow at a real rate of 3.3 pct this year before easing to a 3.0\npct growth rate next year when U.S. economic growth is expected\nto decline, Royal Bank of Canada, Canada's largest bank, said\nin its monthly economic forecast.\n    The forecast is from fourth quarter to fourth quarter. The\nbank did not give Canada's real rate of growth for 1986. The\nbank said it expects the Canadian dollar to remain at the 75\nU.S. ct level for the next few months as major economic\nfundamentals have not improved enough to return the currency to\na higher level in the absence of a wider interest rate spread.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
