        "BODY": "Union and New South Wales government\nofficials have reached a compromise in a dispute over workers\ncompensation, averting increased industrial action in the\nstate, union sources said.\n    But some unions, including those of building and mining\nworkers, said they were dissatisfied with the deal and would\ncontinue their strikes for a few more days.\n    State officials said the government had agreed to revise\nits proposals to cut compensation and would allow slightly\nhigher cash benefits for injured workers.\n    Under the original proposal, which sparked strikes and\nother industrial action in the state on April 7, workers'\ncompensation would have been cut by one third. Full details of\nthe compromise package are not yet known.\n    The Labour Council, affiliated to the Australian Council of\nTrade Unions (ACTU), had threatened to paralyse New South Wales\nunless the government modified its pending legislation on the\nissue.\n    State officials said the only sectors affected in the past\nthree days were some government building projects, railway\nfreight movement and cargo handling in Sydney's ports.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
