        "BODY": "The former chief currency\ndealer of Herstatt Bank, which collapsed in 1974 on foreign\nexchange speculation in West Germany's biggest banking crash,\ncan stand trial for damages, a court ruled.\n    The court overturned a claim by Danny Dattel that a case\nfor damages should not be allowed after such a long interval.\n    Herstatt creditors are seeking 12.5 mln marks from Dattel,\nwhom they accuse of causing losses at the bank of over 500 mln\nmarks by manipulating forward foreign exchange contracts.\n    The crash of the private Herstatt bank with losses of over\none billion marks stunned West Germany's business community,\nand led to a tightening of banking regulations.\n    The losses were even greater than the 480 mln marks\nannounced recently by Volkswagen as a result of fraud in\ncurrency transactions.\n    Ivan Herstatt, managing director of the bank when it\ncollapsed, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison in\n1984 but appealed. Six other people associated with the bank\nwere jailed in 1983.\n    But Dattel was freed from prosecution after he produced\nmedical evidence of paranoia caused by Nazi persecution during\nhis childhood, which might have led him to take his own life.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
