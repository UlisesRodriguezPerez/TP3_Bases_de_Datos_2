        "BODY": "The International Coffee Organization\n(ICO ) council talks on reintroducing export quotas continued\nwith an extended session lasting late into Sunday night, but\ndelegates said prospects for an accord between producers and\nconsumers were diminishing by the minute.\n    The special meeting, called to stop the prolonged slide in\ncoffee prices, was likely to adjourn sometime tonight without\nagreement, delegates said.\n    The council is expected to agree to reconvene either within\nthe next six weeks or in September, they said.\n    The talks foundered on Sunday afternoon when it became\napparent consumers and producers could not compromise on the\nformula for calculating any future quota system, delegates\nsaid.\n    Coffee export quotas were suspended a year ago when prices\nsoared in response to a drought which cut Brazil's crop by\nnearly two-thirds. Brazil is the world's largest coffee\nproducer and exporter.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
