        "BODY": "Sweden's Sandvik AB <SVIK.ST> and\nDiamant Boart SA of Belgium, in which Societe Generale de\nBelgique <BELB.BR> holds an indirect 52 pct stake, have\nfinalised negotiations on merging oil and gas drilling tool\nactivities, officials of both companies said.\n    Staffan Paues, President of the new Brussels-based joint\nventure company Diamant Boart Stratabit SA (DBS), told a news\nconference that the merged firm would be able to offer products\nfor all types of drilling operations.\n    He said there were already signs that a slow recovery from\nrecession was under way in the oil and gas industries.\n    \"Stability in oil prices should lead to renewed investment\"\nPaues said.\n    DBS, which Paues said began operations today, brings\ntogether Sandvik's wholly-owned U.S. Subsidiary Strata Bit Corp\nof Houston and Diamant Boart's petroleum activities in Europe,\nNorth America, the Middle and Far East and Africa.\n    Paues said the merger was a direct result of the sharp fall\nin oil prices 18 months ago which led oil firms to cut back\nexploration activities. Officials said the complementary\ncharacter of the two firms' operations was a further reason.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
