Mike Synar said today that while\nPresident Reagan is ready to use military force to protect\nKuwait tankers in the Gulf, the United States is ill-prepared\nat home to deal with a new energy crisis.\n    Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, made his remarks in comments\non a study by the General Accounting Office (GAO) on the U.S.\nparticipation in the 1985 test of the emergency oil sharing\nprogram of the International Energy Agency.\n    The IEA, an alliance of 21 oil consuming countries, was\nformed after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo to find ways to deal\nwith any future oil cutoff.\n    Synar said, \"the president is prepared to take military\naction to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers but has been unwilling to\ntake less dangerous, equally-important action to prepare our\nnation for the next energy crisis.\"\n    Reagan said the U.S. military would protect Kuwaiti oilers\nto assure the West of a continuing supply of Middle East oil,\nincreasingly being threatened by the Iranian-Iraqi war. Synar,\nwho asked for the GAO report after criticism of U.S. action in\na previous IEA test, said the United States successfully\nadvocated a test limited to training participants in oil\nsharing procedures and the system's mechanical aspects.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
