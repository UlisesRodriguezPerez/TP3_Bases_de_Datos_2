        "DATELINE": "    ROTTERDAM, April 27 - ",
        "BODY": "Effective extraction of the toxic\nmetal cadmium from soil may at last be feasible using soybean\nplants, research in the Netherlands by a Belgian-based\nenvironment group shows.\n    Cadmium, naturally drawn up by plants and passed on to\nconsumers, has been shown to produce kidney damage and\nresulting calcium loss as well as causing high blood pressure\nand cancers, a spokesman for the Ecological Life and\nCultivation (VELT) said.\n    Three years of experiments by the organization showed\nsoybean plants extracted up to 16 pct of soil-borne cadmium,\nwhich went into the leaves and not into the beans themselves.\n    Cadmium is present in the soil because of emissions in the\npast by factories producing non-ferrous metals, the spokesman\nsaid.\n    \"Although many of these factories are now using far safer\nmethods of manufacture, the cadmium is already in the soil and\nuntil now there has been no way to get rid of it,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
