        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, March 5 - ",
        "BODY": "Jaguar Plc <JAGR.L> is about to sell its\nnew XJ-6 model on the U.S. And Japanese markets and expects a\nstrong reception based on its success in the U.K., Chairman Sir\nJohn Egan told a news conference.\n    Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to\n830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightly\nbelow 1985's 121.3 mln, Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average\nprofit growth of 15 pct per year. However, the introduction of\nthe new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down.\n    Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to\nsell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987.\n    U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover,\nfinance director John Edwards said.\n    A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwards\nsaid the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German\ncompetitors offered an \"umbrella\" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6\nhad also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would\nrestrict the car's price.\n    Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a\n12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of\nits receipts for longer periods, John Egan said.\n    In the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10\npct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pct\nof net sales and training two pct.\n    Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the\nother half. The firm is in early stages of considering the\nbuilding of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg,\nbut Egan said this would take at least another three years\n    On the London Stock Exchange, Jaguar's shares were last\nquoted at 591p, down from 611p at yesterday's close, after\nreporting 1986 results which were in line with market\nexpectations, dealers said.\n REUTER...\n\u0003"
