        "TITLE": "U.S. GASOLINE SURPLUS SEEN OVER NEAR TERM",

        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, April 24 - ",
        "BODY": "Unless U.S. refiners reduce the amount\nof gasoline they now produce, the oil industry will enter the\ncoming summer driving season with the largest surplus of motor\nfuel since 1984, oil analysts and traders said.\n    \"They key question is how much gasoline refiners produce in\nthe coming weeks,\" said Larry Goldstein of Petroleum Industry\nResearch Inc. \"If refiners cut output and demand turns upward,\ngasoline stocks could begin to draw, and the surplus could\npotentially turn around in four to eight weeks,\" said\nGoldstein.\n    The American Petroleum Institute said U.S. gasoline stocks\nfor the week ended April 17 are 37.6 mln barrels above last\nyear's levels, and analysts said they don't believe the\nexpected one to two pct rise in demand will take care of the\nsurplus before the start of the summer driving season, which\nbegins Memorial Day weekend.\n    The API said the last time stocks were this high was in\n1984, when there was a 27 mln barrel excess. Oil traders said\nthat the surplus held throughout the summer of 1984, depressing\nprices for the motor fuel.\n    Over the past several weeks, analysts said they expected\nrefiners to reduce production because there was no profit in\ncontinued production of gasoline due to the surplus. However,\nrefineries continued to operate at higher levels, they said.\n    U.S. refineries have been running at about 78.8 pct of\ncapacity during March and April this year, compared to 77.5 at\nthis time last year, API statistics show.\n    Because of the current excess in stocks, one planner for a\nmajor oil company said he believed that most companies are\ncontemplating cutting refinery throughput over the near term.\n    He said some refiners appear to be selling less\naggressively in order to have product on hand to meet the\nexpected rise in demand this summer.\n    Goldstein said that other factors, such as higher speed\nlimits, the gasoline lead phasedown, and possible new\nrestrictions on gasoline vapor pressure could tighten the\nsupply situation this summer.\n    However, a planner at another major oil company said that\nalthough large inventories are dampening the price outlook for\ngasoline this season, he does not expect refiners to cut output\nsoon.\n    That oil company planner said high crude oil runs reduce\nthe refiner's average costs, making the incremental barrel of\ngasoline cheaper to produce.\n    Most analysts expect a slight upturn this summer over the\nsummer of 1986. Bo Poates, an analyst at the Energy Futures\nGroup Inc said he foresees demand up about one pct in the\nsecond and third quarters of 1987.\n    Chase Econometrics' Scott Jones sees gasoline demand rising\n1.9 to 2.2 pct for the year, due mainly to continued low\nprices.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
