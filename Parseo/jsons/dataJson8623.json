        "BODY": "The council of the\nAustralian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) said it\nwill press on with its campaign for major improvements to\nAustralia's petroleum taxation structure.\n    The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly\ndisappointed by the Australian government's position on\ntaxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy\nMinister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference.\n    As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to target\nany tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach to\nsecondary taxation of petroleum.\n    APEA had expected the government to make positive responses\nto detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of\nexisting secondary tax disincentives to exploration and\ndevelopment, the council said.\n    It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by\nEvans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed\nwith the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation.\n    Evans told the conference the government did not plan to\naccept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow\ndeductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure.\n    \"The government's unwillingness to allow the deduction of\nunsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore\narea in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is\nprofit based,\" the APEA council said.\n    The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil\nexploration companies that it had realistic answers to the\nindustry's concerns, despite its recognition of the industry's\nproblems, the council said.\n    The industry has called for the end of all discriminatory\nsecondary taxation of petroleum, citing them as major\ndisincentives at a time of low oil prices.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
