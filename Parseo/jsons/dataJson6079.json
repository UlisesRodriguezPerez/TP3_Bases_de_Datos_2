        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 17 - ",
        "BODY": "A proposal by two U.S. House\nDemocrats to target government farm benefits to small- and\nmedium-sized farms was warmly received by Democrats on a\nHouse subcommittee today.\n    \"On balance, this is the best new idea I have seen,\" said\nRep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), Chairman of the House Agriculture\nSubcommittee on Wheat, Feedgrains and Soybeans. \"This is the\nfirst hard constructive proposal coming out as an alternative\nto the (Reagan) administration's farm proposal.\"\n    The plan, offered by Reps. Tim Penny (D-Minn.) and Byron\nDorgan (D-ND), would raise target prices for wheat to 5.00 dlrs\nper bushel and for corn to 3.50 dlrs. Producers could receive\ndeficiency payments on up to 80 pct of normal yield but not\nmore than on 30,000 bu of corn and 20,000 bu of wheat.\n    The proposal also would require acreage reductions of 20\npct, eliminate generic certificates and prohibit persons not\nactively engaged in farming from receiving program benefits.\n    Dorgan said the bill would save 24 billion dlrs over five\nyears, protect family farms and eliminate government\naccumulation of stocks because nonrecourse loans would be\nhalted.\n    However, Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said the measure would\n\"involve the federal government in deciding and defining who a\nfamily farmer is.\"\n    Roberts said the bill, for example, would restrict program\npayments to 500 acres of wheat production in western Kansas.\n    Other Republicans on the panel questioned how the bill\nwould determine if a person was actively engaged in farming and\ntherefore eligible for payments.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
