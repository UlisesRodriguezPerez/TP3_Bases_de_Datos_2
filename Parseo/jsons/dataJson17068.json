        "BODY": "Japan should look out for possible\neffects of the yen's recent sharp rise on Japan's economy as\ngrowth remains slow, the government's Economic Planning Agency\nsaid in a monthly report submitted to cabinet ministers.\n    EPA officials told reporters the underlying trend of the\neconomy is firm but growth is slow due to sluggish exports.\n    Customs-cleared exports by volume fell 4.9 pct\nmonth-on-month in February after a 2.8 pct fall in March.\n    The government must take adequate economic measures to\nexpand domestic demand and stabilise exchange rates in a bid to\nensure sustained econonic growth, the report said.\n    The report made a special reference to the yen's renewed\nrise and its effect on the economy, the officials said, adding\nthe agency's judgement of current economic conditions has not\nchanged since last month.\n    The EPA said last month Japan's economy is beginning to\nshow signs of bottoming out, conditional upon exchange rates.\n    The dollar fell below 139 yen in early trading today - a\npost-war low.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
