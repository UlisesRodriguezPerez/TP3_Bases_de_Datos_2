        "BODY": "U.S. Trade Representative Clayton\nYeutter said the United States will retaliate if the European\nCommunity adopts a proposed tax on vegetable oils, but he did\nnot say what EC products would be singled-out for reprisal.\n    Speaking to the National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA)\nconvention here, Yeutter said he is \"cautiously optimistic\" the\ncontroversial oils tax proposal will be rejected by the EC\nCouncil of Ministers.\n    Yeutter said the proposed tax is a \"flagrant violation of\nthe spirit of GATT\" because it would imperil the zero binding\nduty on U.S. exports of soybeans to Europe.\n    He said the Reagan administration has yet to decide on a\nretaliation list. The administration would not reveal a\nretaliation list unless the EC approved the proposal, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
