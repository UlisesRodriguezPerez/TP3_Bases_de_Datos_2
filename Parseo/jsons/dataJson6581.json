        "DATELINE": "    CHICAGO, March 18 - ",
        "BODY": "The Tax Reform Act of 1986 will have a\nsubstantial impact on Continental Illinois Corp, the company's\nannual report says.\n    One provision repeals the reserve method of providing for\nbad debts for banks with over 500 mln dlrs in assets and\nrequires that tax loan loss reserves taken in the past, be\nrestored to current earnings status, it said.\n    As a result, those amounts will be subject to federal\ntaxes, it said. No amounts were disclosed.\n    Continental said it decided to deal with this change \"in\nits entirety\" in 1987.\n    Tax reform will also change foreign tax credit limitation\nrules, and although the impact will not be material in the\nshort term, the Act will require, for the first time, that\nincome from certain foreign subsidiaries be taxable, the report\nsaid.\n    The new legislation also reduces existing tax credits by\n17.5 pct in 1987 and 35 pct in 1988 and later years, it said.\n    Continental's investment tax credits carryforwards of 12.8\nmln dlrs at 1986 year end will be reduced to 10.6 mln dlrs in\n1987 and, if not used in 1987, to 8.3 mln dlrs in 1988, it\nsaid.\n    Another provision of the Act could result in limiting the\nuse of tax credits if a change in ownership of Continental\ntakes place, the report said.\n    This could happen if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp\nsells enough shares of Continental's common stock over the next\ntwo years to cause a change in ownership, it noted.\n    In December, the FDIC sold about one-third of its junior\nconvertible preference stock in Continental to the public in\nthe form of common stock.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
