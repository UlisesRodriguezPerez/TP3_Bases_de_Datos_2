        "BODY": "American Century Corp said it\nhas restated its earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30,\n1986 to provide an additional five mln dlrs to its loan loss\nallowance, causing a restated year-end net loss of 14,937,000\ndlrs, instead of 9,937,000 dlrs.\n    The company said the change came after talks with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission on the company's judgement\nin considering the five mln dlrs collectible.\n    In the note to its 1986 financial statement, American\nCentury said it considered the five mln dlrs collectible,\nmaking its loan loss provision less than required.\n    The company said in spite of the SEC decision, it still\nfeels its allowance for possible loan losses at June 30, 1986\nwas adequate and that it has considered all relevant\ninformation to determine the collectibility of the five mln dlr\nreceivable.\n    But, it said continued disagreement with the SEC staff\nwould not be in its best interest.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
