        "BODY": "The Federal Trade Commission said\nits staff has urged the governor of Georgia to veto a bill that\nwould prohibit petroleum refiners from owning and operating\nretail gasoline stations.\n    The proposed legislation is aimed at preventing large oil\nrefiners and marketers from using predatory or monopolistic\npractices against franchised dealers.\n    But the FTC said fears of refiner-owned stations as part of\na scheme of predatory or monopolistic practices are unfounded.\nIt called the bill anticompetitive and warned that it would\nforce higher gasoline prices for Georgia motorists.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
