        "BODY": "The Senate budget committee sits\ndown tomorrow to start drafting a fiscal 1988 budget, with the\nbudget writers expected to look at several proposals for fuel\ntaxes and other tax options to cut the budget.\n    In a briefing book for the drafting sessions, a number of\nrevenue raising tax options are proposed, including a five dlrs\na barrel fee on domestic and imported oil, a fee just on\nimported oil, and a broad based tax on domestic energy\nconsumption based on five pct of value.\n    Other proposals include various excise taxes and\ncombinations of import surcharges or tariffs, including a 10\npct import across the board import surcharge that would raise\n22 billion dlrs next year alone, more in later years.\n    The committee, however, will only include revenue numbers\nin its proposed budget with the actual revenue decisions left\nto the House and Senate tax-writing committees.\n     The committee will draft a budget which its chairman, Sen\nLawton Chiles, a Florida Democrat, said he hopes would raise at\nleast 18 billion dlrs in revenues, or about half the minimum 36\nbillion dlr deficit reduction he has in mind.\n    The House Budget Committee also plans to start drafting a\nseparate budget plan later this week, which would have to be\nreconciled with the Senate version. The final budget would be\nthe fiscal 1988 spending and revenue blueprint.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003"
