Pete Domenici, a main sponsor\nof legislation to set an oil import fee, said the\nadministration's energy security report was based on flawed\neconomic assumptions.\n    The New Mexico Republican said the report did not take into\naccount the last few weeks' drop in domestic oil production in\nits statement that an oil fee would raise prices for consumers.\nThe report said a decline in economic growth as a result of the\nfee would reduce tax revenues. \"A five dlr (per barrel) oil\nimport fee will provide the stimulus to create jobs and\ninvestment, \" and raise revenues, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
