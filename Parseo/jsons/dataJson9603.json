        "BODY": "Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige\nsaid the U.S. trade deficit should start to decline soon,\npossibly in the figures for February or March.\n    \"We could see the trade deficit start down in February or\nMarch,\" Baldrige said in an appearance before the Senate\nGovernmental Affairs Committee.\n    He predicted the trade deficit, which was 170 billion dlrs\nin 1986, would decline by 30 to 40 billion dlrs in 1987 and in\n1988.\n    Baldrige said he was making his prediction without having\nseen the February trade figures, but he said that the volume of\nimports has dropped beginning with the fourth quarter of 1986\nand will continue to drop in this quarter.\n    The eventual turnaround in the monthly trade figures will\nreflect the impact of the decline in the dollar, Baldrige said.\n    Ealier, Treasury Secretary James Baker told the committee\nthat the trade deficit had levelled off, but Baldrige said he\nwas more optimistic, adding, \"I think we turned the corner in\nFebruary.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
