        "BODY": "Germany's current account and trade\nsurpluses should narrow sharply in 1987 but they will take a\nlong time to get back to normal levels, the Bundesbank said in\nits 1986 yearly report.\n    The procedure would be slow as an abrupt turnaround in\nexternal factors such as oil prices and exchange rates was not\nexpected. It did not specify what levels it considered normal.\n    West Germany posted a record trade surplus of 124 billion\nmarks in 1986, after 86 billion in 1985 and its current account\nsurplus widened to 76.50 billion from 44.6 billion.\n    Signs imports would continue to rise, a factor already\nnoted at the start of 1986, while exports rose only slightly,\nwould lead to a smaller trade surplus, the Bundesbank said.\n    In real terms, West German imports rose 5.7 pct in 1986\nwhile exports only increased by 0.8 pct.\n    Germany's current account surplus widened to a provisional\n6.6 billion in February from 4.8 billion in January but was\ndown from 6.85 billion posted in February 1986.\n    The trade surplus in February widened to a provisional 10.4\nbillion marks from 7.2 billion in January and was still above\nthe 6.84 billion reached in the same month the year before.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
