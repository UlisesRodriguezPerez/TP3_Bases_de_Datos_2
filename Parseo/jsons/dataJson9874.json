        "BODY": "Anchor Glass Container Corp said\nfirst quarter net income is now expected to exceed the 3.1 mln\ndlrs earned before extraordinary items in the year earlier\nquarter.\n    Previously, the company had said first quarter results\nwould likely be lower than for the 1986 period due to\nproduction disruptions caused by the large number of production\nline changes scheduled during the first quarter, its statement\npointed out.\n    While the disruptive effects of the production line changes\nhad occurred in line with expectations, Anchor Glass said,\nfirst quarter operating results were helped by lower than\nanticipated operating costs and improved margins on sales as a\nresult of a more favorable product mix.\n    The company said its income performance for the full year\nremains very good.\n    It also said Anchor Hocking Corp <ARH> has converted the\nentire principal balance of its Anchor Glass convertible\nsubordinated note to 576,694 Anchor Glass common shares.\n    Anchor Glass said the conversion decreased its total debt\nand increased stockholders' equity by about 9.4 mln dlrs and\nincreased common shares outstanding to 13,902,716.\n    It said the conversion will also reduce its annualized net\ninterest expense by about 1.1 mln dlrs, or 600,000 dlrs after\ntaxes.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
