        "BODY": "Moore Corp Ltd expects 1987 profits from\ncontinuing operations will exceed 1986 results and recover to\n1985 levels when the company earned 152 mln U.S. dlrs or 1.70\ndlrs a share, president M. Keith Goodrich said.\n    \"We'll have a substantial increase in earnings from\ncontinuing operations,\" he told reporters after the annual\nmeeting. He said he expected profits would recover last year's\nlost ground and reach 1985 results.\n    In 1986, profits from continuing operations slumped to\n139.5 mln dlrs or 1.54 dlrs a share. The total excluded losses\nof 30 mln dlrs on discontinued operations.\n    Goodrich said Moore is still actively looking for\nacquisitions related to its core areas of business forms\nmanufacturing or handling.\n    \"We could do a large acquisition,\" he said when asked if\nthe company could raise as much as one billion dlrs for this\npurpose.\n    Chairman Judson Sinclair, answering a shareholder's\nquestion, told the annual meeting that a special resolution\npassed by shareholders to create a new class of preferred\nshares would allow Moore to move quickly if it decided to\npursue an acquisition.\n    \"If we were to make a major acquisition ... it means we can\nmove with a certain expediency,\" Sinclair said.\n    Asked if the resolution was designed to give Moore\nprotection from a possible hostile takeover, Sinclair said\nonly, \"I know of no threat to the corporation at this time.\"\n        \n Reuter\n\u0003"
