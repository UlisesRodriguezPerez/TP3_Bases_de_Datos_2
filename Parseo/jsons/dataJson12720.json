        "TITLE": "U.S. ACREAGE CUTS SEEN LIMITING STOCK BUILD",
        "AUTHOR": "    By Maggie McNeil, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, April 2 - ",
        "BODY": "Sharp cuts this year in U.S. planted\nacreage may not make a big dent in the U.S. grain stockpile but\nwill at least keep grain surpluses from increasing, Agriculture\nDepartment and industry commodity analysts said.\n    \"The scenario is turning around on stocks. The whole\nsupply/demand picture could finally be getting more in\nbalance,\" a USDA analyst said.\n    The USDA prospective plantings report this week indicated\nthat U.S. farmers will idle 52-55 mln acres in annual acreage\nreduction programs this year. An additional 20 mln acres have\nbeen enrolled in the conservation reserve program, bringing\ntotal idled acreage in the U.S. to 72-75 mln acres, almost a\nthird of the nation's total 235 mln acre crop base.\n    Production of wheat, corn and soybeans in 1986/87 will\nprobably closely match annual usage, limiting any buildup in\nstocks, analysts said.\n    \"It's a substantially different story from last year when\nwe added 1.5 billion bushels of corn to the stockpile,\" Vernon\nMcMinimy, director of commodity research for Staley Co. said.\n    Interviewed at an agribusiness education conference here,\nMcMinimy said that 67.6 mln planted acres of corn will likely\ntranslate into 60 mln harvested acres, and with normal yields,\nfinal production of 6.9 to 7.0 billion bushels.\n    McMinimy estimated that total U.S. corn disappearance in\n1986/87 could end up at 7.1 billion bushels, possibly resulting\nin a 200-million bushel reduction in the current corn stockpile\nof 5.45 billion bushels.\n    \"To say this represents a turn-around is wrong, but we're\nat least in a holding pattern,\" George Hoffman, director of\ncommodity analysis for Pillsbury said.\n    Hoffman said wheat stocks could rise slightly by the end of\n1986/87 to 1.9 billion bushels due to \"significantly less\"\ndomestic feed use for wheat because of lower corn prices.\n    USDA analysts, however, project slightly higher usage and\nsaid wheat stocks will either decrease slightly or at least not\nincrease. With yearly use at around two billion bushels, next\nyear's projected crop could be used up, an analyst said.\n    \"We won't be adding to stocks. Stocks are at a record now,\nso if we can begin to touch them even minutely through acreage\nreductions, that would be an improvement,\" an Agriculture\nDepartment wheat analyst said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
