        "BODY": "The port of Philadelphia was closed\nwhen a Cypriot oil tanker, Seapride II, ran aground after\nhitting a 200-foot tower supporting power lines across the\nriver, a Coast Guard spokesman said.\n    He said there was no oil spill but the ship is lodged on\nrocks opposite the Hope Creek nuclear power plant in New\nJersey.\n    He said the port would be closed until today when they\nhoped to refloat the ship on the high tide.\n    After delivering oil to a refinery in Paulsboro, New\nJersey, the ship apparently lost its steering and hit the power\ntransmission line carrying power from the nuclear plant to the\nstate of Delaware.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
