        "BODY": "China's trade deficit in the first\nquarter fell to 1.05 billion dlrs from 3.04 billion in the same\n1986 period, customs figures show.\n    Zhang Zhongji, spokesman of the State Statistical Bureau,\nquoted the figures as showing exports rose 27 pct to 7.28\nbillion dlrs and imports fell 5.1 pct to 8.33 billion.\n    He said if imports of gifts, foreign aid items and\nmaterials for joint ventures are excluded, the deficit was only\n350 mln dlrs, and the surplus on invisibles was 700 mln. As a\nresult, foreign exchange reserves increased somewhat from their\nlevel at end-1986, he said, but gave no figure.\n    Official figures show the reserves at 10.514 billion dlrs\nat end-1986, down from 11.9 billion at end-1985.\n    Zhang said one reason for the rise in exports was improved\nincentives to export firms, which are being allowed to retain\nmore foreign exchange from the goods they sell.\n    He said first quarter exports to Hong Kong and Macao rose\n35.5 pct to 2.48 billion dlrs and imports rose 55.3 pct to 1.46\nbillion. Exports to Japan fell 2.3 pct to 1.28 billion and\nimports 24.4 pct to 2.14 billion.\n    Exports to the U.S. Rose 23 pct to 640 mln dlrs and imports\nfell 26.7 pct to 840 mln.
