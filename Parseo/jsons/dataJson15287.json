        "BODY": "South Korea's purchase of about 2.4\nmln tonnes of U.S. corn in the past six months -- close to\ndouble last year's total -- indicates that imports from the\nUnited States, as well as total imports are set for a dramatic\njump, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.\n    In its World Production and Trade Report, the department\nsaid total South Korea corn imports for the 1986/87 season\n(Oct-Sept) are estimated at 4.3 mln tonnes, with about 3.4 mln\ntonnes from the United States.\n    During the 1985/86 season, imports totaled only 1.3 mln\ntonnes of U.S. corn out of a total of 3.6 mln tonnes.\n    Ite appears the Koreans are shifting back to U.S. corn in\nlight of competitive U.S. prices and uncertain supplies from\nChina, Argentina and South Africa, it said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
