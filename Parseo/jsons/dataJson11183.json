        "BODY": "India cut the export duty on coffee\nto 330 rupees per 100 kg from 600 rupees, effective March 23, a\nCoffee Board official said.\n    The reduction should help India reach its coffee export\ntarget of 90,000 tonnes in fiscal 1987/88 ending March 31,\nagainst provisionally estimated exports of 75,000 tonnes in\n1986/87 and an actual 99,254 tonnes in 1985/86, he said.\n    India is likely to press for international export quotas at\na meeting of coffee producers in London this week because of\ndepressed prices, he added.\n    The International Coffee Organisation, which represents\nboth consumers and producers, has so far failed to reach\nagreement on quotas.\n    India feels it will be useful to have quotas now because\nthe slide in prices is unlikely to be halted immediately, he\nsaid.\n    Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market\nprices surged after a drought devastated Brazil's coffee crop.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
