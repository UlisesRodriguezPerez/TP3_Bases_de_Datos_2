Earlier this week, the Bank sanctioned a cut in\nbank interest rates in a surprise move, which aimed at limiting\nsterling's rise ahead of the March 17 budget.\n    But today the pound has strengthened to 72.7 on its\ntrade-weighted index from 72.1 last night, though the U.K.\nCurrency is below its day's high against the dollar.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
