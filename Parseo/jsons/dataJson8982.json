        "BODY": "The U.S. House Foreign Affairs\nCommittee voted to ease restrictions on exports that are now\nkept from shipment to Soviet-bloc countries but are no longer a\nthreat to U.S. national security.\n    The Democratic-controlled committee said the\nadministration's export control policies, which restrict\nshipment of thousands of products, contributed to last year's\nrecord 169 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit.\n    The committee said the legislation will cut government red\ntape and make it easier for U.S. companies to compete with\nforeign producers since many of the goods are readily available\nfrom other countries.\n    Rep. Don Bonker, chairman of the International Economic\nPolicy subcommittee, said the unnecessary restrictions had cost\nthe U.S. 17 billion dlrs in exports a year.\n    \"This is Congress' number one opportunity to attack the\ntrade deficit in a positive way by exporting more,\" the\nWashington Democrat said.\n    The legislation would order the Commerce Department to lift\ncontrols on 40 pct of goods on the restricted export list over\nthe next three years unless other countries agree to comparable\ncontrols.\n    Most of these are of the least sophisticated type of\ntechnology such as medical instruments.\n    It would also give the Commerce Department primary\nauthority to decide which exports will be permitted and limit\nthe Defense Department to an advisory role in reviewing\nrequests to export highly-sensitive technology.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
