        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, June 18 - ",
        "BODY": "The U.K. High Court dismissed an appeal\nby Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc's <RTZL.L> RTZ Oil and Gas Ltd unit\nand ruled that the financial provisions a company makes for the\nfuture cost of abandoning an oil field are not tax deductible,\nthe Press Association reported.\n    The company was appealing against a decision of the Tax\nCommissioners that any such provision was a capital\nexpenditure, not a revenue expenditure, and was not deductible.\nThe court was told that since 1976 the company had made an\nannual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost of\nabandoning a rig.\n    An RTZ spokesman said the ruling was not worrying as the\nsubsidiary had assumed that the provisions were not deductible\nfrom corporation tax payable.\n    It would have been a bonus if the company had won but all\nbudgeting had been on the assumption that it would not, he\nsaid.\n    Oil analysts said that RTZ's assumption of liability was\nshared by the industry as a whole.\n    The ruling appeared to mean that tax relief on the\nexpensive process of abandoning rigs would apply when the\nexpense occurred, not when provisions for future expenses were\nbuilt into the accounts, one analyst added.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
