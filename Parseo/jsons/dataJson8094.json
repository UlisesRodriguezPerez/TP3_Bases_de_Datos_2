        "BODY": "Italy's national airline, Alitalia Spa\n<AZPI.MI>, reporting a 14.6 pct rise in provisional 1986 net\nprofit, said it carried seven pct more passengers on domestic\nroutes last year, but 11.5 pct fewer passengers on flights from\nNorth America and Canada.\n    Alitalia said the drop in North American traffic had been\ndue to a general fall in the numbers of American tourists\nvisiting Europe caused by fears of terrorism.\n    The airline reported provisional net profit rose to 55\nbillion lire from 48 billion in 1985.\n    A spokesman said Alitalia was hoping for an increase in\ntraffic with the U.S. In 1987.\n    It planned to increase the number of flights from Italy to\nNew York to 19 per week, to reinstate flights to Boston and to\nre-open the direct Rome-Milan-Los Angeles service.\n    The spokesman announced that from March 29, Alitalia would\nbe starting a new weekly service to Shanghai.\n    For its summer 1987 programme, it would be adding 127 extra\nflights to European destinations -- an increase of 27 pct.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
