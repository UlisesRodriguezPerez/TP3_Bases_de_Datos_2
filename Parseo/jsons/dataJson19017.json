        "DATELINE": "    OTTAWA, June 18 - ",
        "BODY": "Finance Minister Michael Wilson said tax\nreform will not affect his determination to reign in\nexpenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline\nin the budget deficit in the late 1980s.\n    \"Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,\"\nWilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons.\n    Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrs\nin the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as he\nforecast in the February budget.\n    And in the year ended this past March, the deficit was\nexpected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32\nbillion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said.\n    Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year\nhigher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm income\nsupport programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipated\nrevenues.\n    But finance department documents show the pace of deficit\nreduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and\n1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the\ntransition to the reformed taxation system.\n    The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs in\nfiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1\nbillion dlrs in 1991.\n    Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadian\neconomy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pct\nthis year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by an\nactual 3.1 pct.\n    Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilize at around\nthe current four pct level over the next two years.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
