        "BODY": "South Africa must drive down its\ninflation rate to much lower levels to prevent a further\ndecline in the rand, said Volkskas Bank in its monthly economic\nreview.\n    The bank said that without a major drop in the inflation\nrate, the rand was bound to eventually decrease even more,\nregardless of a sharp rise in the gold price.\n    Inflation is running at an annual rate of some 17 pct and\nthe rand is around 49.53 U.S. Cents. Most economists estimate\ncontinued high inflation.\n    Volkskas predicted the rand will remain fairly steady for\nthe rest of 1987 and then ease slightly next year.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
