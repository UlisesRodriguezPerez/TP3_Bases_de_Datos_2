        "BODY": "The Reagan administration is debating\nwhether to provide government credit guarantees for the export\nof plywood, a U.S. Agriculture Department official said.\n    As a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation\nand Development, OECD, the United States has agreed not to\nprovide any concessional credits on the export of manufactured\nproducts.\n    However, USDA General Sales Manager Melvin Sims told\nReuters the administration is considering allowing USDA to\nprovide its first export credit guarantees for plywood on the\ngrounds it is not a manufactured product.\n    Sims said it was clear that wood products such as\nfurniture, tables and window frames would be considered\nmanufactured goods and therefore ineligible for export credit\nguarantees. However, the case of plywood was less clear.\n    \"As long as it's a basic material, we consider it still just\na processed version of the basic agricultural commodity,\" Sims\nsaid in a telephone interview.\n    Earlier today, USDA said that plywood was eligible under an\nexport credit guarantee offer for Turkey announced yesterday.\nIn its original announcement yesterday, USDA had said the offer\nincluded three mln dlrs for the export of lumber, excluding\nplywood. However, Sims said he did not expect any plywood\nexports to be including under the lumber guarantee offer.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
