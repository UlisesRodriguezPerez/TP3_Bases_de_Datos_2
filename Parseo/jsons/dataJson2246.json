        "BODY": "Turkey is holding a buying tender for\n100,000 tonnes of white sugar on March 24, traders here said.\n    The sugar is being sought for early arrival and will\nprobably be met with April/May shipment sugar, they added.\n    Earlier today newspapers in Turkey carried an advertisement\nfrom Turkish Sugar Factories inviting offers of 100,000 tonnes\nof crystal sugar with a 50 pct option to increase or decrease\nthe amount.\n    Over the 1983/85 period Turkey each year has exported\nbetween 240,000 and 350,000 tonnes of whites to Iran and\nbetween 62,000 and 230,000 tonnes to Iraq.\n    Following lower sugar crops in the past two years analysts\nsaid Turkey needs to import sugar now if it is to continue\nfilling these export contracts, and may need to buy more.\n    Last month London broker C Czarnikow estimated Turkish\n1986/87 production at 1.42 mln tonnes raw value against 1.4 mln\nin 1985/86 and an average 1.76 mln in the previous three\nseasons.\n    The semi-official Anatolian Agency recently quoted Turkish\nMinister of Industry and Trade Cahit Aral as saying Turkey\nwould export 100,000 tonnes of sugar this year and import the\nsame amount.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
