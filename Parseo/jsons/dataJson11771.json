        "BODY": "Taiwan's imports in the second quarter of\n1987 are expected to rise to 7.75 billion U.S. Dlrs from 5.82\nbillion a year earlier and from 6.95 billion in the first\nquarter of this year, the statistics department said.\n    A department official attributed the increase to growing\ndomestic investment by the private and public sectors. It is\nexpected to rise to 4.68 billion U.S. Dlrs from 3.79 billion a\nyear earlier and 3.41 billion during the first quarter.\n    Taiwan's exports in the April-June quarter are expected to\nrise to 12.03 billion U.S. Dlrs from 9.63 billion a year\nearlier and 11.28 billion in the first quarter.\n    The official said Taiwan's trade surplus is expected to\nclimb to 4.28 billion U.S. Dlrs in the second quarter of 1987\nfrom 3.81 billion a year earlier. It was 4.33 billion in the\nfirst quarter of this year.\n    Most of the surplus is expected to come from trade with the\nU.S., Taiwan's largest trading partner and importer of nearly\n50 pct of Taiwan's total exports, he said.\n    He said he expected Taiwan's imports, including grains,\nmachinery and power plant equipment, from the U.S. To rise\nsharply because of government efforts to balance trade with\nWashington. He declined to give figures.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
