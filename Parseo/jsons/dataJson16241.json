        "BODY": "Hungary has announced sharp price\nincreases for a range of food and consumer products as part of\nits efforts to curb a soaring budget deficit.\n    The official MTI news agency said the government decided\nconsumer price subsidies had to be cut to reduce state\nspending. From today the price of meat will rise by an average\n18 pct and that of beer and spirits by 10 pct, MTI said.\n    The measures are also aimed at cooling an overheated\neconomy, and could help dampen Hungarians' appetite for\nimported Western goods which consume increasingly expensive\nhard currency, the diplomats said.\n    The diplomats also said, however, that they did not expect\nthe kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in\nother East Bloc states, notably Poland.\n    MTI said consumer goods will also become more expensive,\nwith the price of refrigerators rising some five pct. It also\nannounced a number of measures to ease hardship, including\nhigher pensions and family allowances.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
