        "BODY": "Phelps Dodge Corp is prepared to make\nanother large non-copper acquisition and a deal could be struck\nin the near future, chairman G. Robert Durham said.\n    Durham told Reuters the company was examining potential\ncandidates but not yet talking with any. Any acquisition must\nhave a different economic cycle to copper, he said.\n    Phelps Dodge, the largest U.S. copper producer, last year\npaid 240 mln dlrs for Columbian Chemicals Co which makes carbon\nblack used in rubber and tires. The purchase was part of a\nstrategic plan to diversify and then match earnings between\ncopper and non-copper operations.\n    The company could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrs to\nbuy another non-copper firm, Durham said, citing 100 mln dlrs\nof cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
