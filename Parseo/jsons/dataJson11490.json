        "BODY": "Canada's airline industry, shaken up by\na recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor for\ngovernment-owned Air Canada, has begun its first serious drive\nfor profitability in 50 years, industry analysts said.\n    \"Now we've got a company that can compete with Air Canada,\"\nsaid Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd.\n\"Clearly, it can go head-to-head in any market.\"\n    The new airline, which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlr\ntakeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small but\ncash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp, was launched last week\nas Canadian Airlines International Ltd.\n    Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the\n6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market, against Air Canada's\n50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about nine\npct.\n    Analysts believe Pacific Western's aggressive and\ncost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the true\npotential of the former CP Air, which floundered for four\ndecades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian Pacific\nLtd.\n    They said CP Air's management style had been not much\ndifferent from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, because\nneither airline was held accountable to its owners.\n    \"Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, these\ntwo airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neither\nseemed that concerned about the bottom line,\" said Bradley.\n    \"But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be very\nconscious of profitability and shareholder return. And Air\nCanada is on the verge of going that way,\" he said.\n    CP Air, always fighting for market share rather than\nprofits, was \"a perennial money-loser,\" analyst Wilfred Hahn of\nBache Securities Inc said in a recent report.\n    Prior to its takeover in December, it had accumulated\nlong-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985, its\nlosses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs.\n    Air Canada, widely expected to be privatized later this\nyear in a public share offering, lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs on\nrevenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of more\nthan 2 billion dlrs.\n    Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold to\nthe public, the prospect of privatization at a time of\nincreased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay more\nattention to finances, analysts said.\n    It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit \"in\nexcess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs\" for 1986. However, this profit\nrecovery was due less to management skill than the fact that\nall Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said.\n    Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year,\nattracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 in\nVancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors.\n    For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct air\ntraffic growth, and they expect profits will come from\ncost-cutting and careful spending.\n    Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said\ninstitutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to their\nportfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that new\ncompetition makes profit growth less certain.\n    \"The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. At\none time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody\nelse's,\" Friend said.\n    Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airline\nshares for at least a year.\n    Analysts said Air Canada's immediate concern ahead of a\npublic stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routes\nwithout setting off a political storm.\n    It also will be faced with an expensive but necessary\nupdating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft.\n    Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later,\nalready has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase of\na dozen aircraft from Europe's Airbus Industrie.\n    Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week ordered\nsix commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it would\nsoon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or the\nBoeing Co.\n    Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet,\nneeds to make fewer replacements and can afford these without\nhurting profits.\n    Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects Canadian\nAirlines' profit in 1988 will more than double last year's 29.8\nmln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
