        "DATELINE": "    BRUSSELS, March 19 - ",
        "BODY": "European Community (EC) industry\nministers agreed on a plan for voluntary steel plant closures,\ndrawn up by industry lobby group Eurofer, and calculated to\nlead to the loss of about 22,000 jobs.\n    The ministers resolved that the proposed closures, which\nshould bring production capacity more in line with weak demand,\n\"remain considerably below the surplus in capacity.\"\n    They asked the EC Executive Commission to consult with\nEurofer, major steel companies and with governments, to\npinpoint scope for further capacity reductions beyond the\nannual 15.26 mln tonnes identified by Eurofer.\n    The Commission will draw up a new system  of steel\nproduction quotas to protect vulnerable EC firms from the full\nrigors of open competition.\n    Commission sources said any new system would cover only\nheavy products representing about 45 pct of the market, instead\nof 65 pct under the present system.\n    Ministers hope to approve a closure program when they meet\nagain in Brussels on June 1, the sources said.\n    Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes told ministers\ncapacity was 30 mln tonnes in excess of requirements and that\nthis excess ought to be eliminated by the end of 1990.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
