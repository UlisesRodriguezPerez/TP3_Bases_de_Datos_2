        "BODY": "China and Australia's Victoria state\nsigned a joint venture contract for a 290 mln dlr aluminium\nprocessing plant in China that will export to South Korea,\nAustralian officials told journalists.\n    China has no official direct trade or government ties with\nSeoul, while it maintains close links with North Korea.\n    China International Trust and Investment Corporation\n(CITIC) would have 75 pct of the equity in <Bohai Aluminium\nIndustries Ltd>, the company to build the rolling mill and\nextrusion plant on the northeast China coast, they said.\n    It was China's largest joint venture so far, they said.\n    \"A joint venture opens up the potential for penetrating\nmarkets that would not otherwise be possible (for China),\"\nVictoria state treasurer Rob Jolly said.\n    An Australian diplomat said CITIC was eager to pursue South\nKorean markets. Indirect trade between China and Seoul is\ngrowing but is not officially publicised.\n    Victoria's <Aluvic Ltd>, on behalf of the state government,\nwill hold a 25 pct equity stake in the project, which is\nintended as a sister plant to Victoria's Portland aluminium\nsmelter. CITIC in May agreed to invest about 80 mln dlrs in\nPortland.\n    The China-based joint venture would process Portland\naluminium and aim to sell aluminium products to the domestic\nChinese market as well as for export, Jolly said.\n    The Australian side's investment was limited to about 22\nmln dlrs, but Aluvic would have the right to appoint key\nmanagers, he said.\n    Australian officials said they hoped the goodwill generated\nby their participation would lead to further CITIC investment\nin Victoria. The Chinese group enjoys a high level of\nindependence from Peking's central government and has extensive\noverseas investments.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
