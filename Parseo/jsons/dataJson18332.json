        "BODY": "A Colombian group announced the suspension\nof its bombings of oil pipelines pending the government's levy\nof a social tax on foreign petroleum companies and an 800 mln\ndlrs fine on the Occidental Petroleum Corp <OXY>.\n    There was no indication the government would meet the\nconditions demanded by the leftist National Liberation Army\n(ELN).\n    According to the state oil firm, ECOPETROL, the ELN carried\nout 72 attacks on petroleum pipelines between 1984 and 1986.\n    The assaults, the most recent launched two months ago, have\ncaused an estimated total of 50 mln dlrs in damage.\n    In a communique, the ELN said it would demand a tax of one\ndollar per barrel of crude oil pumped by foreign firms as a\ncondition for maintaining its suspension of the assaults.\n    Foreign oil firms pump an average of 225,083 barrels per\nday in Colombia. Colombian tax authorities are investigating\nOccidental, a U.S.-owned firm, for alleged tax evasion.\n    If the charges are proven, the firm could face a fine of up\nto 800 mln dlrs. The ELN demands the government charge the\npenalty.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
