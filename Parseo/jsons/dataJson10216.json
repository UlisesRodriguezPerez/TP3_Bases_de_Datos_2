        "DATELINE": "    TORONTO, March 26 - ",
        "BODY": "Canamax Resources Inc and Pacific\nTrans-Ocean Resources Ltd said they conditionally approved\nstarting production at their jointly owned Ketza River gold\ndeposit in the Yukon after a study recommended the move.\n    They said production was conditional on approval of a water\nlicense and arrangement of appropriate financing. They\nestimated development costs for the mine and mill would total\n21.1 mln dlrs, including three mln dlrs of working capital.\n    The feasibility study anticipated gold production of 49,600\nounces a year at a cost of 129 Canadian dlrs a short ton, they\nsaid.\n    Canamax and Pacific Trans-Ocean said the project would\nyield a 40 pct after-tax real rate of return at a gold price of\n400 U.S. dlrs an ounce.\n    They said they would mine 460,000 tonnes of proven and\nprobable mineable reserves of oxide ore grading 0.45 ounce gold\nper ton at a yearly rate of 112,000 tonnes for a mine life of\n4.25 years.\n    Possible reserves of 75,000 tonnes grading 0.38 ounce gold\nper ton at the break zone would extend mine life by a year,\nwith considerable potential for development of further oxide\nore reserves at the deposit, they said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
