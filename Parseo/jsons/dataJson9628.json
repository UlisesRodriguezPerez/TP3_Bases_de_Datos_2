        "BODY": "The Semiconductor Industry\nAssociation urged the U.S. government to impose trade sanctions\nagainst Japan for violating the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Trade\nAgreement.\n    In a letter to Treasury Secretary James Baker the group\nsaid sanctions should be imposed against Japanese chipmakers as\nof April 1 and should continue until the United States is\nsatisfied that there is full compliance with the agreement.\n    The group said action by Japan to cut back on semiconductor\nexports is not what is required.\n    \"America's interests require that agreements be honored and\nthat U.S. industries not bear the burden for the persistent\nunwillingness or inability of the government of Japan to\ndeliver on its commitments,\" the trade group said.\n    The White House Economic Policy Council is expected to\ndiscuss possible sanctions against Japan at a meeting scheduled\nfor Thursday.\n    The trade group said Japan has not lived up to the terms of\nthe agreement last year which was aimed at ending Japanese\ndumping of semiconductors and at opening Japanese markets to\nforeign-based manufacturers.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
