        "BODY": "Union Carbide Corp is looking to\nacquisitions and joint ventures to aid its chemicals and\nplastics growth, according the H.W. Lichtenberger, president of\nChemicals and Plastics.\n    Describing this as a major departure in the company's\napproach to commercial development, he told the annual new\nbusiness forum of the Commercial Development Association \"We\nare looking to acquisitions and joint ventures when they look\nlike the fastest and most promising routes to the growth\nmarkets we've identified.\"\n    Not very long ago Union Carbide had the attitude \"that if\nwe couldn't do it ourselves, it wasn't worth doing. Or, if it\nwas worth doing, we had to go it alone,\" Lichtenberger\nexplained.\n    He said \"there are times when exploiting a profitable\nmarket is done best with a partner. Nor do we see any need to\nplow resources into a technology we may not have if we can link\nup profitably with someone who is already there.\"\n    He said Carbide has extended its catalyst business that way\nand is now extending its specialty chemicals business in the\nsame way.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
