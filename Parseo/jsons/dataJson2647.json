        "DATELINE": "    CHICAGO, March 6 - ",
        "BODY": "Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp said it\nfiled a petition asking the U.S. Interstate Commerce Commission\nto reconsider its earlier rejection of the merger of the\nholding company's railroad assets.\n    The ICC had rejected in July the merger of the Santa Fe and\nSouthern Pacific Railroads on the grounds that it would reduce\ncompetition.\n    Santa Fe in its petition outlines an array of\npro-competitive agreements with other railroads which would\npreserve the economic benefits of the merger for the merged\nrailroad and the public.\n    If the commission agrees that public benefits and\ncompetitive enhancements will result, it can vote to reopen the\nmerger case. Interested parties have until March 25 to file\nstatements in response to the supplemental petition.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
