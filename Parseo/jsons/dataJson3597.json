        "BODY": "Raab Karcher AG, a trading\nsubsidiary of VEBA AG <VEBG.F>, said it increased operating\nprofit in 1986 despite a sharp decline in turnover, and added\nthere were good chances this profit level could be held in\n1987.\n    Operating profit rose to just under 120 mln marks in 1986,\nfrom around 100 mln in 1985.\n    However, the group's third party sales fell sharply to 7.2\nbillion marks from 9.4 billion the year before, largely due to\nlower prices for energy products, particularly oil and coal,\nmanaging board chairman Klaus Giesel told a news conference.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
