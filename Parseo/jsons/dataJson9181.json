        "BODY": "Nippon Steel Corp <NSTC.T> plans to\nreduce its dividend to three yen in the year ending March 31\n1987 from the five yen of 1985/86, a company spokesman said.\n    The company estimated parent company current losses at 15\nbillion yen in 1986/87, including a gain of 95 billion yen from\nthe sale of securities. This compares with a 36.07 billion yen\nprofit a year earlier.\n    Sales in 1986/87 are seen at 2,150 billion yen, down from\n2,685 billion a year ago.\n    Poor business prospects were attributed to the yen's rise\nand slow world steel demand. Nippon is expected to report\nparent company results in late May.\n    Total 1986/87 crude steel production is estimated at 25.57\nmln tonnes, down from 27.98 mln a year earlier.\n    Crude steel production is likely to be below 1986/87 output\nbut forecasts for profits and sales in the year starting April\n1 are unavailable yet, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
