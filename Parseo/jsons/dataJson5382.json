        "BODY": "Representatives of cocoa consuming\ncountries at an International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council\nmeeting here have edged closer to a unified stance on buffer\nstock rules, delegates said.\n    While consumers do not yet have a common position, an\nobserver said after a consumer meeting, \"They are much more\nfluid ... and the tone is positive.\"\n    European Community consumers were split on the question of\nhow the cocoa buffer stock should be operated when the ICCO met\nin January to put the new International Cocoa Agreement into\neffect, delegates said.\n    At the January meeting, France sided with producers on how\nthe buffer stock should operate, delegates said. That meeting\nended without agreement on new buffer stock rules.\n    The EC Commission met in Brussels on Friday to see whether\nthe 12 EC cocoa consuming nations could narrow their\ndifferences at this month's meeting.\n    The Commissioners came away from the Friday meeting with an\ninformal agreement to respond to signs of flexibility among\nproducers on the key buffer stock issues, delegates said.\n    The key issues to be addressed at this council session\nwhich divide ICCO members are whether non-member cocoa should\nbe eligible for buffer stock purchases and what price\ndifferentials the buffer stock should pay for different types\nof cocoa, delegates said.\n    A consumer delegate said producers and consumers should be\nable to compromise on the non-member cocoa question.\n    A working group comprising delegates from all producing and\nconsuming member countries met briefly this morning, then broke\nup into a producer meeting and an EC meeting, followed by a\nconsumer meeting.\n    Producers, who are in favour of the buffer stock buying a\nvariety of grades of cocoa and oppose non-member cocoa being\naccepted, reviewed their position ahead of the working group\nmeeting this afternoon.\n    \"We are waiting to see what consumers say,\" a producer\ndelegate said. \"We hope they will be flexible or it will be\ndifficult to negotiate.\"\n    The ICCO comprises 33 member countries. Non-\nmembers include the U.S., a consumer, and Malaysia, an\nincreasingly important producer.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
