        "DATELINE": "    FRANKFURT, March 25 - ",
        "BODY": "The Bundesbank bought large amounts\nof dollars for yen in an apparent attempt to hold the dollar\nabove 149 yen, dealers said.\n    The dollar intervention was in concert with some other\ncentral banks, they said.\n    Dealers said the Bank of Japan and Bank of England\nsupported the dollar against the yen earlier today and that\nthese two banks and the U.S. Federal Reserve were also active\nyesterday.\n    The Bundesbank declined to comment on the dealers' remarks.\n    Dealers said the intervention underlined the determination\nof central banks to keep currencies within recent ranges\nfollowing last month's agreement in Paris by six leading\ncountries to foster currency stability.\n    One dealer said he had been repeatedly in contact with the\nBundesbank during the morning to see if it wanted to buy\ndollars after the Japanese and U.K. Central bank moves.\n    He said the Bundesbank told him it was observing the\nsituation to see if it should intervene in consultation with\nother central banks.\n    Since the Paris agreement on February 22 the dollar had\nuntil yesterday traded in a 1.8150-1.8700 mark range, and above\n150 yen, with traders reluctant to push the dollar down to test\ncentral banks' resolve to defend currency stability.\n    But the test came this week with the dollar falling below\n1.81 marks and 150 yen. Dealers said a reviving trade dispute\nbetween Washington and Tokyo and growing sentiment that the\ndollar would have to fall further to narrow the obstinate U.S.\nTrade deficit were behind the weakness.\n    This week's intervention showed central banks were prepared\nto cooperate to defend the Paris pact, dealers said.\n    Dealers said it was significant the West German and British\ncentral banks were supporting the dollar against the yen.\n    That showed the pact involved multilateral cooperation by\ncentral banks to foster currency stability, they said.\n    But it was unclear how such cooperation was being arranged\nand how frequent consultations between central banks were.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
