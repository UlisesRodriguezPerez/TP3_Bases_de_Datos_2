        "BODY": "South Africa's new foreign debt\nagreement sparked a rally in local financial markets, but\nbankers and economists said the pact removes only one source of\nanxiety from a still depressed economy.\n    \"We have not gone from 'no confidence' to 'full confidence'\nyet,\" commented one banker, who saw the agreement as having\nmarginal influence on fundamental economic problems.\n    Money market analysts cited the debt renegotiation as the\nmain impetus behind increases today in both the commercial and\nfinancial rand.\n    The commercial rand, used for current account transactions,\nrose 0.5 cts to 49 U.S. Cts while the financial rand jumped\nnearly two cts to 33 U.S. Cts.\n    All equity and fixed investment flows of foreigners take\nplace through the financial rand, which is considered the main\nbarometer of South Africa's attractiveness to overseas\ninvestors.\n    Analysts predicted the debt arrangement plus further gains\nin the gold price could push the commercial rand over 50 U.S.\nCts and the financial rand to 35 cents in the next few weeks.\n    They said the financial rand in particular was being driven\nby a tentative provision in the new debt agreement that could\nfavorably affect the currency.\n    Foreign creditors may get permission to convert loan\nbalances and short-term claims into equity investments in South\nAfrica.\n    Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said the Reserve Bank\nwas \"investigating the implications of such conversions in light\nof terms and restrictions of the financial rand system.\"\n    Du Plessis in disclosing the new agreement last night said\nthe recent sharp rise in the financial rand was an example that\n\"some foreign investors are again taking a more realistic view\nof South Africa.\"\n    Terms of the debt agreement call for South Africa to repay\n1.42 billion dlrs of 13 billion dlrs of frozen debt over the\nnext three years. The agreement extends a standstill\narrangement, expiring June 30, that has been in place since\nAugust, 1985.\n    Bankers said the repayment amounts essentially confirmed\ntheir private estimates and could be comfortably met by the\nmonetary authorities.\n    \"They (creditors) asked for the maximum amount and we\noffered the minimum,\" said one banking source, reacting to\nreports from London that creditors were hoping for larger\nrepayments.\n    Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said South Africa\nshould have \"no difficulty whatsoever\" with the terms.\n    Economists said the debt agreement would have no\nsignificant impact on economic problems continuing to face\nSouth Africa including high rates of inflation and\nunemployment, labour unrest and political uncertainty.\n    Johannesburg Stock Exchange president Tony Norton, speaking\nyesterday before the debt agreement, said the economy was \"in\nbad shape\" and there was \"an awful lot of talk but little action\"\nto cure serious problems.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
