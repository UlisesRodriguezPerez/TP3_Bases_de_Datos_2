        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 19 - ",
        "BODY": "The U.S. Agriculture Department is\nproposing tighter federal standards setting allowable limits on\ninsect infestations in grain shipments.\n    The changes in the standards would include the following:\n    -- Establishing equal tolerances for the number of live\ninsects in shipments of food grains, feed grains and oilseeds.\n    -- Revising the definition of \"infested\" to give equal value\nto all insects injurious to grain.\n    -- Establishing lower levels of infestations. In 1988, the\ninfested level would be set at three or more live insects per\nrepresentative sample (about 100 grams), in 1990 two or more\ninsects, and in 1992 the final infestattion level would be set\nat one or more live insects per representative sample.\n    -- Revising the definition of sample grade by adding a\nlimit of 10 live or dead insects per sample.\n    -- Revising the definition of sample grade for wheat by\nadding a limit of 32 insect-damaged kernels per 100 grams of\nwheat.\n    The department asked for public comments on the proposals\nby April 17.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
