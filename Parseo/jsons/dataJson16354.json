        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, April 13 - ",
        "BODY": "Foster Wheeler Corp <FWC> said an\naudit of its Stearns Airport Equiment Co Inc unit, revealed\n\"substantial discrepancies\" in Stearns accounts that may\nrequire material adjustments to previously announce\nconsolidated results of the company and its subsidiaries.\n    Foster said certain Stearn officers and senior management\nmade Stearn's operations appear more profitable than they were\nby improperly recording job costs. It said Stearn's president\nand controller had resigned. A Foster spokesman said he did not\nknow the names of the president and controller, and could not\nimmediately comment on the release.\n    Foster said the amount involved in the \"discrepancy\" is\nabout 13.7 mln dlrs before taxes or about 8.2 mln dlrs net\nafter tax due to an \"improper recording of job costs over a\nperiod of several years and continuing through part of the\nfirst quarter of 1987.\"\n    Stearns is a unit of Foster's Conergic Corp subsidiary.\nThe company said the impact on its results for 1987 was not\n\"likely to be significant\" but the amount to be charged to\nprior periods had not been determined.\n    Foster reported after tax earnings of 28 mln dlrs, 26 mln\ndlrs and 35.4 mln dlrs for 1986, 1985, and 1984, respectively.\n    Stearns, based in Crowley, Texas, makes airport baggage\nconveyor equipment and passenger loading bridges.\n    Foster, a diversified international concern with 27\nsubsidiaries operating worldwide, is based in Livingston, New\nJersey. Its reported revenues for the period ended December 26,\n1986 of 1.3 billion dlrs.\n    The company said a detailed audit and investigation is\ncontinuing. A company spokesman declined to comment further on\nthe investigation.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
