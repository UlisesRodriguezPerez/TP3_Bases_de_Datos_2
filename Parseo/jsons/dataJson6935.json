        "BODY": "European sugar output on the basis of\nthree year average yields will be over half a mln tonnes white\nvalue down on last year although yields do vary widely from\nyear to year, broker C Czarnikow said in its market review.\n    European Community sowings are likely to be down compared\nwith last year. There have been suggestions these sowings might\nrespond to the recent upsurge in world prices, but Czarnikow\nsaid \"it is not the sort of fact that easily becomes known.\"\n    The broker bases its forecasts on Licht planting estimates\nwhich put W Germany, the Netherlands and USSR lower but\nHungary, Romania, Poland, Turkey and Yugoslavia higher.\n    Czarnikow's projections in mlns tonnes white value and\nthree differing yields include\n      '87/88  max      aver      min    1986/87\n France       3.57     3.42     3.28       3.44\n W Germany    3.08     2.88     2.64       3.19\n EC          13.82    13.01    12.13      13.76\n W Europe    17.71    16.45    14.98      16.71\n Poland       2.02     1.80     1.13       1.74\n USSR         8.65     7.60     5.71       8.05\n E Europe    13.87    12.14     9.08      12.44\n All Europe  31.58    28.58    24.06      29.15\n  REUTER\n\u0003"
