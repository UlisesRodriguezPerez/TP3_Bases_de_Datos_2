Dlrs each with a\nfour-for-three share alternative.\n    Both are 70 pct owned by Canada's Alcan Aluminium Ltd <AL>\nwhich will take the share swap option, Alcan Australia deputy\nchairman Jeremy Davis said in a statement. The remainder of\nAlcan New Zealand's totalled issued 21.84 mln shares are\nbroadly held while Alcan Australia's are primarily held by\ninstitutions. Alcan NZ last traded at 1.55 NZ dlrs, while Alcan\nAustralia today ended four cents down at 1.15 dlrs.\n    Davis said the offer, which is subject to approval by the\nNew Zealand Overseas Investment Commission, was a response to\nthe integration of the two countries' markets under the\nAustralia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations treaty.\n    Alcan New Zealand shareholders who accept the offer would\nalso receive the final dividend of 10 cents a share normally\npayable on May 27.\n    Alcan Australia would invite New Zealand representation to\nits board and would apply to list its shares on the New Zealand\nStock exchange, Davis said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
