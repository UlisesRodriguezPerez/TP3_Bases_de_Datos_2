        "TITLE": "BAKER/STOLTENBERG MEETING SOOTHES MARKETS",
        "AUTHOR": "    By Jonathan Lynn and Anthony Williams",
        "DATELINE": "    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 - ",
        "BODY": "News of a meeting between U.S. Treasury\nSecretary James Baker and West German Finance Minister Gerhard\nStoltenberg on Monday soothed currency markets, allowing the\ndollar to recoup much of the day's losses, dealers said.\n    News of the meeting, which took place in Frankfurt in great\nsecrecy, came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism by\nBaker of West German monetary policy, which had provoked fears\nthat the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy.\n    The dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over two\npfennigs in after hours New York trading, dealers there said.\n    The announcement of the meeting, also attended by\nBundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, was made simultaneously\nin Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New York\nmarkets.\n    Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policies\naccepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministry\nspokesman in Bonn said.\n    The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of\n1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.\n    The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market\nreacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest\nrates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said that\nWest Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord.\n    Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged to\ncoordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, with\nthe surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulating\ntheir economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budget\ndeficit.\n    West German government sources said rising West German\nmoney market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre\npact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest\nrates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been rising\nsince May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed\nraised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.\n    German yields have also risen over this period, but less\nmarkedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up\nshort-term rates by changing the terms on its security\nrepurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering the\nmoney market.\n    The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,\ncompared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany's\ninability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,\nbut also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the\nBundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary\ngrowth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,\nbank economists said.\n    This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the\npragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl\nsince early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the\nmore cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.\n    In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,\nthe Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this\nmorning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.\nanger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.\n    \"They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much\nunder American fire,\" said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser at\nSwiss Bank Corp here.\n    \"It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a\nsignificant retreat from its position,\" added Giles Keating,\neconomist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.\n    The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of\nthe Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact\non Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money market\neconomists said.\n    Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank\ndoes not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation\nrate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,\nlittle changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.\n    The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication\nthat the meeting would take place, although the Finance\nMinistry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.\n    Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked to\ncomment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvre\naccord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he\nassumed monetary cooperation would continue.\n    The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West\nGermany for Sweden on Monday. This week he is also due to visit\nDenmark and Belgium.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
