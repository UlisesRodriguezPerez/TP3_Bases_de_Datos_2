        "BODY": "An extension of the sixth International\nTin Agreement, ITA, for one or two years beyond June 30 is\nincreasingly likely, International Tin Council, ITC, delegates\nsaid following a special council session today.\n    A formal decision will be taken at the quarterly council\nsession on April 8-9 when decisions are needed on the budget\nand activities for the year beginning July one, they stated.\n    Delegates said most countries now favour a continued legal\nITC presence to answer the still unresolved legal disputes over\nthe outstanding debts of its buffer stock with court hearings\nlikely to continue well after the June 30 expiry of the pact.\n    The ITC was informally told of the appeal made yesterday by\nAmalgamated Metal Trading Ltd, AMT, against the January court\nruling against it in the legal bid it led on behalf of ITC\ncreditor brokers to have the ITC wound up.\n    In January the judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no\njurisdiction to wind up the tin council, the ITC was not an\nassociation within the meaning of the U.K. Companies act, and\nthe winding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect in\nrespect of an arbitration award.\n    AMT is appealing on all points and has said it is important\nfor the court to accept that a winding-up petition is a move to\nenforce an arbitration ruling.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
