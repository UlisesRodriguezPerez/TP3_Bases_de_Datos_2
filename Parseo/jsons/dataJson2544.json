        "BODY": "E.A. Viner Holdings Ltd said the earlier\nreported Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of Heck's Inc <HEX>, in\nwhich Viner holds 408,000 shares, would not materially affect\nViner's capital position or its ability to carry on its\nprofitable brokerage business.\n    Viner said its brokerage subsidiary, Edward A. Viner and Co\nhad regulatory capital of 24.5 mln U.S. dlrs at year-end 1986.\n    The company said Heck's Chapter 11 filing could, however,\naffect Viner's previously reported legal action to recover\ncosts from an aborted merger agreement with Heck's.\n     It said it and the Toussie-Viner group, with which it made\nthe merger offer, were assessing their options regarding the\nHeck's investment.\n    Viner earlier reported a fourth quarter loss of 918,000\nU.S. dlrs after a 1.5 mln dlr writedown of its stake in Heck's.\nIt earned 585,000 dlrs in the previous fourth quarter.\n    Full-year earnings totaled 2.9 mln dlrs against a\nyear-earlier loss of 1.5 mln dlrs. The full-year earnings\nincluded a 900,000 dlr net writedown of the Heck's stake, it\nsaid.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
