        "BODY": "Peru will put into effect Monday a foreign\nexchange rationing system for imports designed to stop a slide\nin the country's international reserves, a government decree in\nthe Official Gazette said.\n    Under the system, importers will be required to present a\nbill from the foreign seller of goods and apply for a license\nfor foreign exchange. The central bank will have 10 days to\ndecide whether to issue the required foreign exchange.\n    Net international reserves now total about 800 mln dlrs\ncompared to 1.54 billion dlrs a year ago.\n    The system will be effective until the end of 1988.\n    A ceiling for foreign exchange availability will be set by\na council with members from the central bank, the economy\nministry and the planning and foreign trade institutes. The\ncentral bank will issue licenses to procure foreign exchange in\naccordance with guidelines set by the council.\n    Peru's reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the trade\nsurplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.1 billion in\n1985, according to preliminary central bank estimates.\n   Total exports dropped to 2.50 billion dlrs last year against\n2.97 billion in 1985.\n   Imports last year rose sharply as gross domestic product\ngrew by about 8.5 pct, the highest economic growth level\nregistered in 12 years. Imports were about 2.49 billion dlrs in\n1986 against 1.87 billion in 1985, according to preliminary\nestimates.\n    The cushion of reserves allowed Peru to take a hard-line\ndebt stance last year and suspend most payments due on its 14.3\nbillion dlr foreign debt.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
