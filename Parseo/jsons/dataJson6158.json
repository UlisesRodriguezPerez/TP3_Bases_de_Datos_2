        "BODY": "The Bank of France expects a continued\nrevival in short-term industrial activity, but the outlook for\nany improvement in France's record 10.9 pct unemployment rate\nremains bleak, the Bank of France said in its monthly review.\n    The upturn in activity in all industrial sectors except the\nagro-food sector in February more than compensated for the fall\nin January, while construction and civil engineering\nexperienced a recovery which appears likely to extend over the\nnext few months.\n    Internal demand rose and the export situation improved, in\nparticular toward the European Community (EC), the Bank said.\n    Stocks decreases and order book levels, with the exception\nof the agro-food industry, improved substantially.\n    In addition, retail prices and salaries stabilised last\nmonths.\n    Production rose in all sectors except agricultural\nmachinery and aeronautics, where it stabilised, and ship\nconstruction, where it declined.\n    The car industry was the major beneficiary of the upturn in\nactivity in February, with both domestic and export orders\nrising.\n    In the consumer goods sector, actitity rose sharply despite\na fall in the household goods sector and stability in\npharmaceuticals.\n    Among semi-finished products, output rose sharply, helped\nby a strong growth in construction materials.\n    But activity in the retail sector declined slightly over\nthe past two months.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
