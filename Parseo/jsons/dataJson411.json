This compares with its forecast of a\nshortage in the system today of around 700 mln stg.\n    The central bank purchased bank bills outright comprising\n41 mln stg in band one at 10-7/8 pct 361 mln stg in band two at\n10-13/16 pct and 54 mln stg in band three at 10-3/4 pct.\n    Money market dealers said the Bank of England has recently\nused the offer of borrowing facilities to signal that it does\nnot want to see an early reduction in U.K. Base lending rates.\n    The Bank does this by lending to the discount houses at\nrates of interest higher than its prevailing money market\ndealing rates.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
