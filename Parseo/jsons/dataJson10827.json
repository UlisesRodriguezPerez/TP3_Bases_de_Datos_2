        "BODY": "Canada's gross domestic product rose 0.1\npct, seasonally adjusted, in January after gaining 1.0 pct in\nDecember but falling 0.1 pct and 0.3 pct in November and\nOctober, Statistics Canada said.\n    January's rise, in 1981 prices, was fueled largely by a 0.5\npct gain in the goods producing sector. Output in\nservices-producing industries declined 0.1 pct from December's\nlevel.\n    January's level was 1.29 pct higher than the same month a\nyear ago.\n    The federal agency said it was the second straight gain for\ngoods producing industries. Most of the growth occurred in\nmanufacturing and construction.\n    Within manufacturing, strong gains were posted in the wood,\nmachinery, non-metallic mineral and food product groups.\nSignificant declines were recorded in the output of automobiles\nand parts, however.\n    In the services sector, increases in finance, insurance and\ncommunication were more than offset by declines in\ntransportation, storage and the retail trade.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
