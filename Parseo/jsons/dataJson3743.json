        "BODY": "Shares of Du Pont Co rose today after\naccumulating recommendations from Shearson Lehman Brothers and\nFirst Boston, traders said.\n    Du Pont, which opened with a two point gain, stood at\n109-1/8, up 1-1/8.\n    First Boston's analyst was not available for comment.\n    Analyst Theodore Semegran of Shearson said he raised his\nearnings estimates for the company to 7.25 dlrs a share in 1987\nand eight dlrs a share in 1988. The company earned 6.35 dlrs a\nshare in 1986.\n    \"Good domestic demand, higher operating earnings and a\nstrng export business, probably benefitting from a lower dollar\nand effects of reduced imports in chemicals will continue to\naid Du Pont.\" He also noted that energy earnings in the first\nquarter are better than expected because of the rise in crude\nprices. Semegran expects first quarter earnings\nof about 1.85 dlrs a share from 1.67 dlrs last year.\n    He also expects the company to raise its annual dividend\nabout 20 to 30 cts a share, from its current dividend of 3.20\ndlrs a share, \"and a stock split is possible but it has a low\nprobablility.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
