        "BODY": "Burr-Brown Corp said its first\nquarter 1987 results will show profits significantly below the\n1,058,000 dlrs, or 11 cts per share, earned in the first\nquarter last year.\n    The company said the profit decline will be the result of\nan increase in reserves for inventory valuation. The increase\nwill be to cover potential write-downs of certain inventories\nor products used in compact-disc stereo systems.\n    Burr-Brown said the possible write-down is being\nprecipitated by a shift in market demand toward higher\nperformance products.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
