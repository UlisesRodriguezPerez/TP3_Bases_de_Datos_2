        "BODY": "British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey\nHowe backed the United States' attack on an Iranian oil\nplatform on Monday and said it should not worsen the Gulf\ncrisis.\n    \"The United States is fully entitled to take military action\nin exercise of rights of self-defense, in the face of the\nimminent threat of further attacks,\" Howe said in a statement\nissued in London.\n    The United States said its forces destroyed the platform on\nMonday in retaliation for an Iranian missile attack on a U.S.-\nflagged Kuwaiti ship last Friday.\n    Referring to that attack, Howe added, \"I trust the Iranians\nwill fully understand that continued attacks of this kind will\nonly enhance justification for firm action in self-defense.\"\n    At a press conferenced in Luxembourg during a meeting of\nEuropean Community (EC) ministers, Howe was asked about\nstatements from a senior Iranian official who said America was\nnow involved in a full-scale war.\n    \"It would be profoundly undesirable and quite unjustified\nfor Iran to react in that way,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
