        "BODY": "<Noranda Inc> said\nproduction will remain shut down at its fire-damaged copper\nmine here until it can completely examine the mine.\n    The fire, which started Wednesday and burned itself out\nlate yesterday, killed one miner and trapped 56 others\nunderground for about 24 hours. The 56 were eventually brought\nsafely out of the mine.\n    Company spokesman Dale Coffin said the investigation could\ntake from a few days to several weeks, but would not be more\nspecific.\n    Noranda said that, when it resumes production, it plans to\noperate the mine at about one-third of the normal 72,000 metric\ntons annual finished capacity.\n    The fire weakened part of the mine's support structure,\nCoffin said.\n    Noranda said if it decides to keep the mine open, it would\ntake four or five months before it could resume full\nproduction.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
