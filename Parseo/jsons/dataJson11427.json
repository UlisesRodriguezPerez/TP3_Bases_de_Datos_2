        "BODY": "Shifts from mild to very cold\nweather in East Germany damaged winter barley and late sown\nwinter wheat in central regions and barley north of Berlin, the\nU.S. agricultural officer in East Berlin said.\n    In a field report, the officer said indications were that\nwinter kill might well be more than 100,000 hectares compared\nwith 38,000 last year.\n    He said the damage was probably more limited in southern\nand central regions and most widespread in the north.\n    Damage was most severe on plants above the ground where\nlittle or no snow cover was present, he added.\n    The officer said heavy frosts at night followed by sunshine\nduring the day led to some heaving, particularly for well\ndeveloped plants and for winter barley.\n    Furthermore, as the ground surface thawed, some standing\nwater occurred in the fields.\n    The officer said repairing damage will probably call for\nspecial measures this spring in fields with damaged plants and\nwhere stands are thin. Harrowing, as well as well-timed\napplications of nitrogen, will be necessary, he added.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
