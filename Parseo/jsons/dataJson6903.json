        "BODY": "U.S. Agriculture Undersecretary\nDaniel Amstutz indicated the world wheat supply/demand\nsituation has become more bullish recently because of\ndevelopments in the world market and increased consumption.\n    Speaking to a House Agriculture Appropriations\nsubcommittee, Amstutz cited three factors which have improved\nthe wheat outlook.\n    He said world consumption of wheat is increasing by about\n20 mln tonnes this year, primarily for feed use. There are also\nreports from Australia, Canada and Argentina that plantings\nhave been reduced, he said. Furthermore, he cited reports of\ngreater than normal winterkill in the Soviet Union.\n    \"It seems reasonable to expect production and consumption\nto be in far better balance than a year ago,\" Amstutz said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
