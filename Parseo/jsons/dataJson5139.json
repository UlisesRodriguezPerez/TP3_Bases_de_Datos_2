        "BODY": "Negotiators at a United Nations\nconference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement\n(INRA) have agreed on basic elements in a new pact, conference\nchairman Manaspas Xuto said.\n    \"We have resolved major differences of opinion,\" he told\nReuters.\n    Xuto said the way is now cleared for drafting a new accord,\nto replace the current one which expires in October.\n    Xuto said: \"I welcome the friendly and cooperative\natmosphere that has prevailed without interruption\" since the\ntalks began last Monday.\n    \"It is my hope that delegations will go back home and try to\nratify the new agreement,\" he added.\n    The renegotiation conference, under the auspices of the\nU.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), is the\nfourth such meeting in two years.\n    Xuto said producers and consumers had agreed on four\npoints:\n    1) Regular price reviews will be held every 15 months.\n    Previously consumers were proposing 12-month intervals\nbetween price reviews instead of 18 in the current pact.\n    2) If the average of the daily market indicator prices over\nsix months prior to a review is below (or above) the lower\nintervention price (or the upper intervention price), the\nreference price will be automatically revised downwards (or\nupwards) by five pct unless the International Natural Rubber\nOrganisation council decides on a higher percentage.\n    If buffer stock purchases or sales reach 300,000 tonnes,\nthe reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct\nunless the council decides on a higher percentage.\n    3) If the buffer stock reaches 400,000 tonnes, the price at\nwhich the additional contingency stock of 150,000 tonnes is\nbrought into operation will be two Malaysian/Singapore cents\nabove the floor price -- or 152 cents.\n    4) The floor price will not be breached. Throughout the\ntalks producers had adamantly resisted a consumer proposal to\nlower the floor price of 150 cents if the buffer stock,\ncurrently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes.\n    The proposal, initiated by the U.S., Was withdrawn last\nnight, setting the stage for compromise.\n    Legal drafting of provisions will start next week and\nformal adoption of the new accord by the 40 countries taking\npart in the conference is expected to take place on March 20.\n    The current conference was widely seen as the last chance\nto clinch a deal. Three previous attempts to negotiate a new\nfive- year pact had failed, the last round breaking down in\nOctober over consumer demands for tighter controls of the\nbuffer stock.\n    The United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Italy and\nBritain are the major consumers.\n    UNCTAD's latest estimates project an increase of 8.5 pct in\nrubber prices this year and 4.1 pct in 1988.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
