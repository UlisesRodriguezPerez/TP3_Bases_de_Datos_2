        "BODY": "Japanese shipbuilders have applied to the\nstate's Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to restrict\ntonnage built to about half of total capacity for the year\nstarting April 1, officials of the Shipbuilders Association of\nJapan said.\n    Under the plan, 33 yards capable of building ships of more\nthan 10,000 gross tons will curtail operations to three mln\ncompensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) a year against\ncapacity of about six mln CGRT.\n    The Transport Ministry estimates new orders at 3.3 mln CGRT\nin the year to March 1988 and 3.1 mln the following year.\n    The industry has curtailed production due to oversupply\nnearly every year since 1977/78, under cartel or Transport\nMinistry guidelines. The latest guidelines call for a ceiling\nof four mln CGRT in the year to March 31.\n    The cartels, self-imposed and self-regulated, are not\nlegally binding, but industry finds it in its own interest to\nstick to them.\n    The slowdown in orders has been caused by the strong yen\nand a protracted worldwide shipbuilding slump.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
