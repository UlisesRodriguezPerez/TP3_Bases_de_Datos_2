        "TITLE": "US TROPICAL OIL LABELING PLAN SUFFERS DEFEAT",
        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - ",
        "BODY": "A proposal to require imported\ntropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrow\nand possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate.\n    The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a\n10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers' hopes\nthe plan would be adopted this year.\n    A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.\n    Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as an\namendment to a farm spending reduction package.\n    \"I don't see this as a trade issue. I see it as giving\nAmerican consumers the information they need,\" he said.\n    Proponents of the measure, including the American Soybean\nAssociation, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oils\nare high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.\n    The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicating\ntropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourage\nconsumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia,\nIndonesia and the Philippines.\n    But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S.\nTrade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal\n\"blatantly discriminates\" against imports, would be impossible to\ndefend under international trade law and would harm relations\nwith the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.\n    Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of their\nsaturated fats from meat and dairy products and relatively\nlittle from tropical oils.\n    The committee voted largely along party lines, with three\nDemocrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
