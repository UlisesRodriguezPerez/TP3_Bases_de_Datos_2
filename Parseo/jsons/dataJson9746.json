        "DATELINE": "    BRUSSELS, March 26 - ",
        "BODY": "The rebates granted at yesterday's EC\nsugar tender represent a further concession to producers'\ncomplaints that they are losing money on exports outside the\nbloc, trade sources said.\n    They said the maximum rebate of 45.678 European currency\nUnits (Ecus) per 100 kilos was 0.87 Ecus below what producers\nclaim is needed to obtain the equivalent price to that offered\nfor sales into intervention.\n    The rebate at last week's tender was 1.3 Ecus short of the\nlevel producers thought necessary and that of the previous week\nwas 2.5 Ecus below this level.\n    But the sources said producers who have offered a total of\n854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in an apparent\nattempt to persuade the Commission to set higher maximum\nrebates have given no formal indication to the Commission that\nthey intend to withdraw these offers.\n    The French and German operators involved would be able to\nwithdraw the offers up to five weeks after April 1 when the\nsugar will officially enter intervention stores.\n    The five-week period is the normal delay between sugar\ngoing into intervention and payment being made for it.\n    EC officials have said that if the Commission has to buy\nthe sugar, it is determined immediately to resell it, a move\nwhich could drive down market prices further.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
