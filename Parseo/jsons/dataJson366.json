        "BODY": "Ropak Corp said it received\nand accepted about 456,968 common shares and 527,035 Series A\nconvertible preferred shares of Buckhorn Inc at four dlrs and\n5.75 dlrs each respectively in response to its tender offer\nthat expired Friday, and it now owns 34.4 pct of Buckhorn\nvoting power.\n    The company had owned 63,000 common and 25,100 preferred\nshares before starting the hostile tender.  Ropak said it is\nborrowing the funds needed to buy the Buckhorn shares from its\nbank lender and will not need to use any funds that another\nbank had committed to provide under a margin loan.\n    Ropak said it waived minimum acceptance requirements to buy\nthe shares and intends to evaluate a number of possible ways of\ncompleting an acquisition of Buckhorn.  It said it hopes that\nBuckhorn's board will reevaluate its position and enter into\nmeaningful negotiations.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
