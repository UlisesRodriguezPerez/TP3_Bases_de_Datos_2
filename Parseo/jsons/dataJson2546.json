        "TITLE": "TWA <TWA> SUES USAIR <U> OVER POISON PILL",
        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, March 5 - ",
        "BODY": "Trans World Airlines Inc said it filed\nsuit in Delaware Chancery Court against USAir Group Inc and its\nboard of directors seeking to invalidate its \"poison pill\"\nanti-takeover plan.\n    TWA vice president and general counsel Mark Buckstein said\nTWA also sought a declaratory judgement from the court that its\n52 dlr per share takeover offer for USAir would in no way\ninterfer with USAir's possible buyout of Peidmont Aviation Inc\n<PIE>.\n    Buckstein said TWA asked the court to enjoin the\nenforcement of USAir's shareholder rights plan, or \"poison\npill.\" Such provisions, which typically allow for the issue of\nsecurities to shareholders in the event of a hostile takeover\nbid, are aimed at deterring takeovers by making them more\nexpensive.\n    USAir earlier today rejected TWA's offer, saying TWA's bid\nwas an attempt to interfer with its buyout of Piedmont.\n    USAir also had said its counsel would investigate the\nmatter. Tonight, a spokesman for USAir said the airline had no\ncomment on TWA's lawsuit.\n    USAir did respond, however, to a TWA request to the\nDepartment of Transportation for permission to buy up to 51 pct\nof USAir stock and place the stock in a voting trust pending\napproval of a takeover.\n    USAir said the request was \"hastily pasted together in\norder to take advantage of a regulatory anamoly that would\nallow TWA to accomplish in a regulated environment actions that\nwould be impermissable in the non-regulated economy at large.\"\n    USAir called on the transportation department to reject\nTWA's request.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
