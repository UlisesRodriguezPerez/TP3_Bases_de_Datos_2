        "BODY": "Dry areas of the Australian sugar cane\nbelt along the Queensland coast have been receiving just enough\nrain to sustain the 1987 crop, an Australian Sugar Producers\nAssociation spokesman said.\n    The industry is not as worried as it was two weeks ago, but\nrainfall is still below normal and good soaking rains are\nneeded in some areas, notably in the Burdekin and Mackay\nregions, he said from Brisbane.\n    Elsewhere, in the far north and the far south of the state\nand in northern New South Wales, the cane crop is looking very\ngood after heavy falls this month, he said.\n    The spokesman said it is still too early to tell what\neffect the dry weather will have on the size of the crop, which\nis harvested from around June to December.\n    He said frequent but light falls in the areas that are\nshort of moisture, such as Mackay, mean they really only need\nabout three days of the region's heavy tropical rains to\nrestore normal moisture to the cane.\n    But rainfall in the next two or three weeks will be crucial\nto the size of the crop in the dry areas, he said.\n    \"It's certainly not a disastrous crop at this stage but it\nmight be in a month without some good falls,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
