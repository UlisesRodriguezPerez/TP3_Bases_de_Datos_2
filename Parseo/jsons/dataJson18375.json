        "DATELINE": "    HAVANA, June 15 - ",
        "BODY": "The Cuban sugar harvest, which was\nextended almost a month and a half beyond its originally\nscheduled shutdown date, ended here as the last of the island's\n154 mills closed operations, the official newspaper granma\nsaid.\n    The newspaper characterized the harvest, which began in\nlate November, 1986, as \"a tense and pressured campaign.\"\n    In a recent interview with the French communist party\nnewspaper l'humanite, Cuban president Fidel Castro said that\ncrude sugar production during the harvest would be \"less than\n7.5 mln tonnes.\n    The harvest was plagued by a four year shortfall of rain\nwhich reduced the sugar content of the cane and by unseasonable\nrain storms during the first two months of this year which made\ncane cutting by mechanical combines virtually impossible.\n    Many foreign sugar experts voiced doubts during the present\nharvest that raw sugar production would exceed last year's 7.2\nmln tonne mark.\n    In the 1984-85 campaign Cuba produced 8.2 mln tonnes of raw\nsugar.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
