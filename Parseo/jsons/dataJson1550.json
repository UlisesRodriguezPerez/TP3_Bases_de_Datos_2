        "DATELINE": "    HAMBURG, March 4 - ",
        "BODY": "The cost of living in West Germany will\nlikely be about 0.5 pct higher on average in 1987 than in 1986,\nwhen the cost of living actually fell by an average 0.2 pct in\nthe first recurrence of \"negative inflation\" since the 1950s, the\nHWWA economic research institute said.\n    The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from the\nfading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986\ncost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and the\nvalue of the dollar, the institute said in a report.\n    The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in the\ncourse of 1987, but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as a\nwhole because year on year rates will remain negative in the\nfirst part of 1987.\n    Provisional inflation figures for February released last\nweek showed the cost of living last month was 0.5 pct lower\nthan in February 1986. In January prices had fallen 0.8 pct\nagainst the same month a year earlier.\n    The HWWA said its forecast assumed the dollar would remain\naround 1.80 marks and oil prices would range between 15 and 17\ndlrs per barrel.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
