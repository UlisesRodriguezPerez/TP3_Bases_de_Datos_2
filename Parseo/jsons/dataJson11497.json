        "BODY": "Avery Inc said the company will not\nshow a profit in the next quarter and will probably not show a\nprofit in 1987.\n    Speaking at the annual shareholders meeting, chairman\nNelson Peltz declined to estimate when the company would become\nprofitable.\n    Peltz said Uniroyal Chemical Co, acquired last year, would\nincrease Avery's operating earnings but that associated\nacquisition costs would prevent Avery from posting net profits\nfor some time.\n    At the meeting, stockholders approved an increase in the\nauthorized number of common shares to 200 mln from 15 mln.\n    In the fiscal year ended May 30, 1986, Avery reported a\nloss of 489,000 dlrs. The company has changed its fiscal year\nto end Sept 30.\n    The increase in common shares would cover, among other\nthings, the exercise of Triangle Industries Inc's <TRI> and\nDrexel Burnham Lambert Inc's warrants issued in relation to\nAvery's 710 mln dlr acquisition of Uniroyal Chemical late last\nyear.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
