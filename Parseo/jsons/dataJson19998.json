        "BODY": "World oil prices would remain stable\ndespite the U.S. Attack against Iranian oil platforms and\ngrowing tension in the Gulf, Venezuelan Energy Minister Arturo\nHernandez Grisanti said on Monday.\n    He described the situation as \"extremely tense,\" but said\nGulf military activity would not significantly affect prices\nbecause supply and demand were roughly equal.\n    Demand for OPEC crude in the final quarter of 1987 was 18.5\nmln barrels per day (bpd) and the group's members were now\npumping above 18 mln bpd, he told a news conference.\n    Hernandez Grisanti said the supply/demand balance was\nprecarious and prices were in danger of falling from their\ncurrent average of about 18 dlrs per barrel if overproduction\ncontinued.\n    Three or four members of the 13-nation Organisation of\nPetroleum Exporting Countries were \"overproducing in an\nexaggerated manner\" above their assigned quotas, he said.\n    OPEC's overall ceiling is 16.6 mln bpd.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
