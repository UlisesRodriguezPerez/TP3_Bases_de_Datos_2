        "BODY": "The European Community (EC) has\neffectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open its\nmarket to imports before it decides on possible tough\nretaliatory trade measures, EC diplomats said.\n    They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26\nto review the state of trade relations between the two sides.\n    The EC executive commission was asked by representatives of\nmember states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some EC\npledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are\n\"adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market.\"\n    Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing\nstiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japanese\nexports.\n    The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be\ndiscussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministers\non April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepare\nproposals for possible retaliatory action.\n    They said the commission has powers to take some limited\naction before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japanese\nexports of electrical, photographic and other goods being\ndiverted to Europe following of possible U.S. Tariff moves.\n    In May, the ministers are also likely to discuss how to\nprevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a\nresult of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc, which obliges\nthem gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods.\n    Japan's trade surplus with the Community has grown\nsteadily, registering a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
