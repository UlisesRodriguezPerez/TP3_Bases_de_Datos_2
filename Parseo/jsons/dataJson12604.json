        "BODY": "U.S. Trade Representative Clayton\nYeutter said he doubted Japan could avoid the April 17\nimposition of U.S. tariffs on its semiconductor products.\n    The three high-level Japanese government representatives\nwho would be coming here in the next few days to discuss the\nissue would probably be unable to show evidence of continued\ncompliance with the semiconductor trade agreement, Yeutter told\nreporters.\n    \"It would be impossible to provide evidence of compliance\nwith the agreement\" based on sales of only a few days time, he\nsaid.\n    Asked by reporters if the sanctions were 100 pct certain\nfor April 17, he said, \"One could never foreclose all options.\nWe have an obligation to listen to the arguments our trading\npartners make.\"\n    He said the length of the sanctions will be determined by\nJapan and Japanese semiconductor firms.\n    \"They would be lifted only when persuasive evidence provided\ndemonstrates compliance,\" he said.\n    \"Whether a few weeks or a few months depends on their\nactions,\" Yeutter added.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
