        "BODY": "The U.S. Senate on Tuesday backed\nPresident Reagan's retaliatory strike against Iranian targets\nin the Gulf as it moved to take a greater role in making policy\nin the volatile region.\n    Senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsed\nMonday's U.S. attack on two Iranian oil platforms in\nretaliation for an Iranian attack last Friday on a Kuwaiti ship\nflying the American flag.\n    The measure said the attack was a firm indication of U.S.\nresolve that Iran \"cannot take military action against the\nUnited States with impunity.\"\n    Earlier, the Senate cut off Republican stalling tactics and\nset a vote on a measure that could give Congress a larger role\nin making Gulf policy. The measure, however, does not require\nReagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead\nto a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf.\n    While Democrats and Republicans praised the U.S.\nretaliatory strike, many voiced new fears about the growing\nU.S. involvement in the Gulf and some demanded that Reagan\ncomply with the War Powers Act.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
