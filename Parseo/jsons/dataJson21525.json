        "BODY": "Malaysia's recovery from the worst\nrecession in 20 years should receive a boost on Friday when the\ngovernment announces a reflationary budget for calendar 1988\nafter seven years of austerity, economists said.\n    \"Our country is walking on one leg now,\" said Ismail Salleh,\nan economist with the Institute of Strategic and International\nStudies. \"It has to depend on public sector investment for\nfaster growth if the private sector is not moving.\"\n    Gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinking\none pct in 1985. The fiscal year ends December 31.\n    The government has said it expects 1987 growth to be under\ntwo pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pct\nbecause prices for commodity exports have risen sharply.\nMalaysia is a leading exporter of rubber, palm oil, tin and\nsemiconductors and a major producer of cocoa, timber and oil.\n    The government slashed development spending to 9.8 billion\nringgit this year from 14.5 billion in 1986.\n    Economists said unemployment is expected to exceed 10 pct\nin 1988 against about 9.5 pct this year.\n    Local investment also has stagnated, with businessmen\nblaming inconsistent economic policies and lack of incentives.\n    One businessman said too many politicians give the\nimpression that Malaysia was unstable.\n    \"If we can take care of investment confidence, the potential\nto recover strongly is great,\" a banker said.\n    Malaysia's 1987 current account is expected to be in the\nblack with the Central Bank projecting a 500 mln ringgit\nsurplus compared with last year's 1.2 billion ringgit deficit.\n    The government has said its fiscal policies will balance\nthe budget by 1989. The deficit in 1986 was 952 mln ringgit.\n    The government will also repay some of its external debt,\nwhich stood at 51 billion ringgit at the end of 1986.\n    Political leaders have said the budget will not hurt\nordinary people as taxes on basic food and other essential\ngoods are unlikely to change.\n    Businessmen said they hope the government also will cut the\ncorporate tax, now between 45 and 48 pct, to enable Malaysia to\ncompete for investors with neighbouring states.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
