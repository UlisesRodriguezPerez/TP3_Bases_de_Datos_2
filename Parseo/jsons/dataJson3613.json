        "BODY": "Finland's mining and metals group\nOutokumpu Oy <OUTO.HE>, which last week reported a 1986 loss of\n83 mln markka after three successive years of profits, said it\nrestructured its key copper processing division in an attempt\nto rationalize production and improve profitability.\n    Outokumpu's Managing Director Pertti Voutilainen told a\nnews conference the reorganization involved a split of the\ndivision into a new independent division with six profit\ncentres.\n    Outokumpu group had a 1986 loss before appropriations and\ntaxes of 83 mln markka after a profit of 355 mln in 1985. It\nhad profits in 1984 and 1983 but a loss, 171.2 mln, in 1982.\n    Outokumpu acquired two Swedish copper manufacturers in\nJanuary 1986, <Metallverken Ab> and <Wirsbo Bruks Ab>, that\nwere merged into its copper processing division.\n    The division had a turnover of 3.2 billion markka last\nyear, 42 pct of Outokumpu's group turnover of 7.58 billion.\n    The new Outokumpu division, called Copper Products\nIndustry, is to incorporate Outokumpu's copper production\nplants, including its two U.S. Subsidiaries <Nippert Co> and\n<Valleycast Inc>, as well as Metallverken and part of Wirsbo.\n    Outokumpu is planning to make Wirsbo an independent\ndivision in the Outokumpu group and transfer only Wirsbo's\ncopper tube production into one of the new division's profit\ncentres. A definite decision on Wirsbo will be taken later this\nyear.\n    The new division will have production plants in Finland,\nSweden, Norway, the Netherlands and the U.S.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
