        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, April 13 - ",
        "BODY": "Irving Bank Corp said a six pct drop\nin first-quarter net income from a year earlier was largely the\nresult of placing medium- and long-term loans to borrowers in\nBrazil and Ecuador on non-accrual status.\n    Income in the first three months fell to 28.60 mln dlrs\nfrom 30.43 mln in the same 1986 period. Earnings per share\ndropped to 1.51 dlrs from 1.62.\n    Irving put 215 mln dlrs of Brazilian and 33 mln dlrs of\nEcuadorean loans on non-accrual, reducing first-quarter net\nincome by a total of 4.4 mln dlrs after tax.\n    Irving estimates full year net would be reduced by 15.3 mln\ndlrs after tax if no cash interest payments are received on\nthese loans during the remainder of 1987.\n    Also adversely affecting earnings were losses on the\ntrading of securities and higher non-interest expenses,\nalthough these were partly offset by increased trust income,\nprofits from foreign exchange trading and investment securities\ngains, the bank said.\n    The allowance for loan losses was 224.8 mln dlrs, up from\n185.2 mln a year earlier. The provision for loan losses was\n21.8 mln versus 19.5 mln in the first quarter of 1986.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
