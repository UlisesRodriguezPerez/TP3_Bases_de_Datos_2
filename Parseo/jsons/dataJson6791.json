        "BODY": "ESSO SAF <ESSF.PA>, the French subsidiary\nof Exxon Corp <XON>, said it had no immediate plans to shut\ndown one of its two refineries. Exxon's new president Lee R.\nRaymond said earlier that it could decide to close a French\nrefinery.\n    An ESSO SAF spokesman said a closure was a hypothesis that\ndepended on the evolution of the market and refineries' ability\nto make money. He said Port Jerome west of Paris and Fos sur\nMer on the Mediterranean had benefitted from new investment\nover 1985-86 and had last year broken even after stock losses.\n    The Port Jerome refinery has an annual production capacity\nof seven mln tonnes while Fos sur Mer's is five mln, the\nspokesman added.\n    Industry sources said the easiest plant to dispose of would\nbe Fos sur Mer because it is a single refinery, while the Port\nJerome refinery is attached to a wider complex comprising a\npetrochemical plant and a lubricant production plant.\n    Raymond was quoted as saying in a published interview that\nExxon was reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might\ndecide to close one of its French refineries.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
