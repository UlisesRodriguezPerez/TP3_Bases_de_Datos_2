        "BODY": "Ohio Mattress Co said its first\nquarter, ending February 28, profits may be below the 2.4 mln\ndlrs, or 15 cts a share, earned in the first quarter of fiscal\n1986.\n    The company said any decline would be due to expenses\nrelated to the acquisitions in the middle of the current\nquarter of seven licensees of Sealy Inc, as well as 82 pct of\nthe outstanding capital stock of Sealy.\n    Because of these acquisitions, it said, first quarter sales\nwill be substantially higher than last year's 67.1 mln dlrs.\n    Noting that it typically reports first quarter results in\nlate march, said the report is likely to be issued in early\nApril this year.\n    It said the delay is due to administrative considerations,\nincluding conducting appraisals, in connection with the\nacquisitions.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
