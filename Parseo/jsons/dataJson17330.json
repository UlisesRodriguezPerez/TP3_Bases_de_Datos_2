        "DATELINE": "    BRUSSELS, April 27 - ",
        "BODY": "French producers have withdrawn all\noffers to sell more than 700,000 tonnes of sugar into European\nCommunity intervention stocks, EC Commission sources said.\n    They also said West German producers had now withdrawn the\nlast 3,000 of the 79,250 tonnes they sold into EC stores on\nApril 1.\n    The sales were made to protest against the level of export\nrestitutions being granted for sugar at weekly EC tenders.\n    Last Friday, commission sources said the West German\nproducers had withdrawn all but 3,000 tonnes of their sales.\n    The protest by European producers involved sales of 854,000\ntonnes of sugar into intervention, of which 785,000 tonnes were\naccepted by the commission.\n    Under EC regulations, operators had five weeks before\nreceiving payment to withdraw the sugar.\n    Their decision to withdraw the sugar follows what\ncommission sources have said is a slight shift in the\nauthority's stance in recent weeks. The commission last week\nincreased the maximum restitutions to within about 0.5 Ecus per\nkilo of the prices which traders claim are needed to match\nintervention prices.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
