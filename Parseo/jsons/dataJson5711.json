In 1986, Allergan had worldwide sales of 433 mln\ndlrs.\n    It said its Smith Kline and French Laboratories\npharmaceuticals unit, with 1986 sales of 1.9 billion dlrs, will\nfile for Food and Drug Administration marketing approval for a\nnumber of cardiovascular agents, including tissue plasminogen\nactivator, over the next two years.\n    It also said SK and F's U.S. sales force will be 20 pct\nlarger in 1987, with more than 1,000 sales personnel.\n    Smith Kline also said its small clinical laboratory testing\nunit, with 1986 sales of 373 mln dlrs, performs 24 mln tests a\nyear, and sees increases in employee drug testing as well as in\ntesting for the AIDS antibody.\n    Smith Kline said that depending on its share price and the\ncost of money, it may buy back more shares.
