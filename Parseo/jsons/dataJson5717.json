        "DATELINE": "    INDIANAPOLIS, March 16 - ",
        "BODY": "Farm subsidies and protectionist\nmoves threaten healthy trade on both sides of the Atlantic,\nMichael Jopling, British minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and\nFood, warned.\n    \"It would not be sensible to provoke another dispute between\nEurope and the United States,\" Jopling said in remarks prepared\nfor an evening speech.\n    \"But some things are clear and they apply on both sides of\nthe Atlantic. We cannot continue to pile up stocks while world\ndemand shrinks,\" he said.\n    \"Governments must not operate farm policies as if they were\npurely domestic affairs with no impact on others. They also\nhave to recognize that they cannot in the long run develop a\nhealthy and stable farm sector on the basis of protectionism\nand excessive subisdies.\n    \"And above all, Europe and the United States have too many\ncommon interests to make it worthwhile to engage in trade wars\nand competitive export subsidies which end by benefitting no\none.\" He added, \"It is crucial that the United States and the\nEuropean Community remain friends.\"\n    Jopling, who is a member of the EC agriculture committee,\nwas in Indiana to visit several farms prior to talks with U.S.\nofficials in Washington later this week.\n    Jopling also criticized a recent proposal still under\nconsideration by the EC for a tax on vegetable and fish oils.\n    He said his government would oppose such a move because \"We\ndo not think it is correct that a shortage of funds to support\n(EC) farmers should be alleviated by raising money at the\nconsumer's expense.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
