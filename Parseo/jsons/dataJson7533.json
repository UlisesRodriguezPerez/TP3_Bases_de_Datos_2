        "BODY": "About 9,000 miners employed by the\nstate corporation, Comibol, declared a general strike as from\nmidnight (0400 gmt) to press for higher salaries, a statement\nby the federation for Bolivian mine workers said.\n     It said the strike was called to defend the nationalised\nmining industry. The miners were willing to negotiate with the\ngovernment of President Victor Paz Estenssoro, but only if it\nshowed an intention to meet the strikers' demands.\n     The government said the strike was designed to cause it\nembarrassment during the four-day visit of West German\nPresident Richard Von Weizsaecker, which starts on Friday.\n    The miners statement said police had violently evicted\nComibol office workers in the city of Oruro after they began a\nhunger strike yesterday.\n    The government has sacked about 20,000 miners from its\ndeficit-ridden corporation since the collapse in the\ninternational price of tin. The lay-offs represent about\ntwo-thirds of the original workforce.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
