        "BODY": "A strong performance from all BAT\nIndustries Plc's <BTI.L> major sectors enabled the group's 1986\npretax profits to pass the one billion stg level for the third\nyear running, Chairman Patrick Sheehy said in a statement.\n    The group earlier reported a 19 pct rise in profits to 1.39\nbillion, which Sheehy said was achieved without any help from\nexchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions.\n    Good results were achieved by its Argos and Saks Fifth\nAvenue in retailing and by Wiggins Teape and Appleton in paper.\n    Tobacco accounted for about 50 pct of profit with a four\npct gain to 764 mln stg and a two pct increase in world volume.\n    The results were largely in line with analysts expectations\nand BAT shares firmed by two pence to 537p at 0955 GMT.\n    BAT said the U.S. Brown and Williamson unit held most of\nits 1985 gains and increased profit 18 pct in dollar terms.\n    Financial services saw profits double to 282 mln with both\nEagle Star and Allied Dunbar achieving further growth.\n    Allied Dunbar reported a 51 pct rise in life annual\npremiums to 39 mln stg. BAT said it increased new business by\n38 pct in the last nine months after a relatively slow first\nquarter. Its permanent health insurance was now the market\nleader and its Unit Trust group was now the second largest in\nthe U.K.\n    Eagle Star general premiums rose 32 pct to 1.03 billion.\nIts life activities also grew 39 pct with better underwriting\nresults in the second half.\n    Cash flow was strong and the gross debt to equity ratio\ndropped to 41 pct from 51 pct. The net ratio, at 26 pct, left\nthe group strongly placed to pursue its further development.\n    Profits from paper and pulp grew 29 pct to 217 mln stg,\nnearly three times the 1982 level, with Wiggins Teape's sales\nrising 36 pct to pass one billion stg.\n    BAT said in 1986 it had sold 88 BATUS stores in the U.S.\nFor 644 mln dlrs and sold Grovewood Securities for 142 mln stg.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
