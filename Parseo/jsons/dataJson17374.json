        "BODY": "Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves have\nrisen to a new high of 56 billion U.S. Dlrs, and officials\nattribute the increase to a surging trade surplus and the\ninflux of speculative funds.\n    The reserves, up from 54 billion dlrs on April 19, compare\nwith 27.3 billion a year ago, the Central Bank said.\n    Vice economic minister Wang Chien-shien told Reuters: \"The\nrising reserves will certainly intensify our trade friction\nwith the U.S.\"\n    A central bank official, who declined to be named, said\nTaiwan's trade surplus is expected to exceed 5.5 billion U.S.\nDlrs in the first four months of 1987, against 4.25 billion a\nyear ago.\n    The influx of speculative funds, mainly from Hong Kong,\nJapan and the U.S., Also played a major role behind the rise of\nthe reserves, he said, but declined to give figures.\n    Banking sources said almost 10 billion U.S. Dlrs had\nentered Taiwan since early 1986. About three billion of the\nfunds were remitted through different channels, including the\nblack market, since the start of this year, they said.\n    Wang Chao-ming, vice chairman of the government's Council\nfor Economic Planning and Development, said he expects the\nreserves to rise in the next few months because of the\ncontinuing high level of Taiwan's exports and the steady\nappreciation of the local dollar against the U.S. Currency.\n    \"The latest government moves to open (the domestic) market,\ncut import tariffs and lift foreign exchange controls have\nachieved little success,\" he said.\n    Vice economic minister Li Mo said tariffs were cut on some\n1,700 products in January and a further 862 this month in a bid\nto encourage more imports, especially the U.S.\n    More tariff cuts on about 300 imported products, including\ntelevisions, video tape recorders, cosmetics and refrigerators\nwill be announced in a month or two, Li said.\n    Li's colleague, Wang Chien-shien, said the government will\nsend several trade missions to the U.S. This year to buy about\none billion U.S. Dlrs of products, including machinery, power\nequipment, grains and precision tools.\n    \"We earnestly hope to reduce our trade surplus with the\nU.S.,\" he said.\n    Taiwan's trade surplus rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S.\nDlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985, and it widened to\n3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 against 2.78 billion\na year ago, official statistics show.\n    The surplus has increased U.S. Pressure on Taiwan for a\nfaster appreciation of its currency, which has risen by about\n18 pct since September 1985.\n    It opened at 33.10 to the U.S. Dollar today.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
