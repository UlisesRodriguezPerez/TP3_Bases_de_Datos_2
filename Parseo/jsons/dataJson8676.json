        "BODY": "U.S. Trade Representative\nClayton Yeutter said he was unsure whether some of the trade\nissues straining U.S.-Japanese relations would be resolved\nbefore the two countries open trade talks in late April.\n    \"We are having high level discussions on them (the issues)\nwithin the United States...The relationship on some of those is\nvery strained between us (Japan) at the moment and we need to\nrelieve those strains at the earliest possible date,\" he said.\n    \"I am not sure we can wait until late April,\" he added.\n    Yeutter is in New Zealand for a two-day informal meeting of\ntrade ministers who are reviewing the Uruguay round of the\nGeneral Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT).\n    He said he will meet the Japanese delegation over the next\nfew days but declined to discuss methods of relieving the\nstrain between the two countries.\n    Yeutter said earlier the three most contentious trade\nissues were semiconductors, Japanese government unwillingness\nto allow public entities to buy U.S. Super-computers and the\nbarring of U.S. Firms from the eight billion U.S. Dlr Kansai\nairport project near Osaka.\n    The Japanese delegation to the GATT talks said in a\nstatement yesterday they are making major efforts to dismantle\ntrade barriers in their country.\n    \"I am convinced that they are attempting to move their\npolicies in the right direction. The question is how far and\nhow fast,\" Yeutter said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
