        "BODY": "U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm\nBaldrige predicted Congress will pass a reasonable trade bill\nthis year and said tough protectionist legislation could prompt\na trade war.\n    \"The mood of the Congress right now is as tough on trade as\nI've ever seen it in six years in Washington,\" Baldrige said in\na television interview.\n    \"I think we'll still be able to get a reasonable trade bill\nout in spite of that because the whole Congress is trying to\nwork together with the administration, but there is a hardening\ntrade attitude,\" he said.\n    President Reagan opposes protectionist legislation, but\nagreed to support a trade bill when it became apparent that\nopposition Democrats would pass such legislation.\n    However, Baldrige warned measures that would penalise\ntrading partners such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan for\nfailing to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S. Could lead\nto retaliation and he said he would urge Reagan to veto any\nsuch bill.\n    When asked if there is a rising danger of a worldwide trade\nwar, Baldrige said: \"Yes, I don't think there's any question\nabout that.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003"
