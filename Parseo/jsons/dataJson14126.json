        "BODY": "The European Commission has not taken a\ndecision on applications from the British government for the\nrelease of 200,000 tonnes of intervention feed wheat onto the\nBritish market in May and June, Commission sources said.\n    They said last week's cereals management committee agreed\nto release 70,000 tonnes of feed wheat through weekly tenders\nbetween April 14 and May 26. It also indicated it planned to\nallow the release of another 30,000 tonnes from April 23.\n    However, it decided to leave consideration of the release\nof further wheat until later.\n    The British government had applied for the release of a\nfurther 100,000 tonnes in both May and June from British\nintervention stores to prevent market prices rising.\n    However, the sources said, the Commission wanted to review\nthe market situation nearer the time before giving its\napproval.\n    The Commission was given new powers last year to control\nthe release of intervention cereals onto the market, the\nsources noted.\n    Following last week's committee meeting, the U.K. Ministry\nof Agriculture said the Commission had given an assurance that\nadditional quantities of intervention wheat would be made\navailable in May and June. It also said that it was envisaged\nthat monthly releases would be at least 100,000 tonnes,\ndepending on the state of the market.\n    This lead to the widespread assumption that the Commission\nhad actually approved the release of 300,000 tonnes during the\nthree months of April, May and June at last week's meeting.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
