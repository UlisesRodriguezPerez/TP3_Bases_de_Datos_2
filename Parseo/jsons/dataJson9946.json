        "DATELINE": "    PARIS, March 26 - ",
        "BODY": "The Bank of France intervened to buy\nsmall amounts of dollars and sell yen in Paris today to\nstabilise the exchange rates agreed at last month's meeting of\nFinance Ministers of the Group of Five and Canada, foreign\nexchange dealers said.\n    But they said recent central bank intervention in the\nforeign exchange markets appeared to be a limited reaction to\ntemporary pressures rather than a major defence operation.\n    A Bank of France spokesman declined all comment but sources\nclose to the central bank said it had also intervened\nyesterday.\n    Dealers said the earlier intervention was in concert with\nthe Bundesbank and Bank of Japan.\n    The sources said the French central bank could have been in\nthe market again today in two-way operations, not necessarily\non its own account, but to counter short-term pressures arising\nfrom the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31.\n    One major French bank said it bought between five and 15\nmln dlrs for the central bank and sold yen at 149.28 to the\ndollar.\n    Another bank said it had been asked by the Bank of France\nto say it was in the market, a departure from the central\nbank's usual insistence on confidentiality.\n    But other banks said they had seen no sign of intervention,\nwhich they said appeared to be on a very limited scale.\n    \"Even if 10 banks were buying five to 15 mln dlrs, you would\nstill be talking of a small overall amount,\" said one dealer.\n    Recent intervention by the Bank of Japan appeared mainly to\nhave been required to meet year-end window dressing demand for\nyen. \"This is a specific short term phenomenon rather than a\nwider trend,\" the dealer said.\n    Operators have been extremely cautious about testing the\ndollar's trading ranges against the West German mark and\nJapanese yen.\n    These ranges were set in February's stabilisation agreement\nreached here by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker and the\nFinance Ministers of Japan, Germany, France, Britain and\nCanada.\n    But speculative pressures started to build again this week\nafter Baker was quoted on British television at the weekend as\nrepeating earlier statements that Washington had no target for\nthe dollar.\n    Baker yesterday moved to defuse speculation he was talking\nthe dollar down, telling a Cable News Network interviewer and a\nSenate committee he stood by the Paris agreement. Foreign\nexchange markets had been misreading his comments, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
