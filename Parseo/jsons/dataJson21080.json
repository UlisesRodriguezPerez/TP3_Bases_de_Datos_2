        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - ",
        "BODY": "The U.S. is drafting options including\npossible trade retaliation against Argentina in a dispute over\nthe differential between soybean and product  taxes which\nBuenos Aires levies on exports.\n    The drafting of retaliation options follows the failure\nof high-level talks earlier this month to resolve a case filed\nby the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association, U.S.\nofficials said. The NSPA charged that Argentina's differential\nexport taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports in\ncompetition with the U.S.\n    \"Our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict\n(Argentine) access to our market,\" said one U.S. source.\n   \n    The U.S. shelved the NSPA case earlier this year after\nTrade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Argentina agreed to\nend the differential.\n    But when Argentina announced export taxes for the 1987/88\nyear in July, the differential was narrowed only one pct.\n    Deputy trade representative Michael Smith met Agriculture\nminister Ernesto Figuerras and Economy minister Juan Sourroille\non September 29 and the Argentine officials said they could not\nnarrow the differential further for 1987/88.\n    As a result of the impasse, the U.S. is considering\nrestrictions on imports of items such as Argentine corned beef\nand finished leather, the U.S. sources said.\n    A decision on reprisals is likely to be made by the Reagan\nadministration soon, they said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
