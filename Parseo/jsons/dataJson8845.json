        "BODY": "Robert Heller, a member of the Board\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System, said commodity\nprices could form a useful guide for setting domestic and\ninternational monetary policy.\n    Speaking to the conservative Heritage Foundation, Heller\nsaid, \"A broadly based commodity price index may be worth\nexploring\" as a guide to monetary policy.\n    \"In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might\nbe tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, monetary\npolicy might be eased,\" he said.\n    Commodities are also standardized to avoid measurement\nproblems and occur at the beginning of production so as to give\n\"early warning\" signs of wholesale and retail changes.\n    \"There is no need to react to every small fluctuation in\ncommodity prices or to do so on a daily basis,\" Heller said in a\nprepared text.\n    \"But if commodity prices exhibit a broad trend, a policy\naction might be considered,\" he said.\n    Heller said using a broad-based commodity price index as an\nindicator for monetary policy would also contribute to\nstabilized currency exchange rates.\n    Commodity prices are generally uniform worldwide and prices\nfor them are more consistent than for other types of goods, he\nsaid.\n    He said other beneficial effects would be to stabilize\nexport commodity prices for developing countries by using a\ncommodity basket as a guidepost for monetary policy.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
