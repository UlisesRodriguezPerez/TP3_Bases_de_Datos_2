        "BODY": "Argentine grain growers reduced\ntheir estimates for maize and soybean production in the current\nharvest in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.\n    Soybean production for 1986/87 is now estimated to reach\nbetween 7.7 and eight mln tonnes, versus 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes\nestimated a week ago and eight to 8.4 mln tonnes estimated in\nmid-February.\n    But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8.5 to 12.7\npct greater than last year's total of 7.1 mln tonnes, according\nto official figures, and would be a new record.\n    The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a\nrecord 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares and increased 10.8 to 13.8 pct\ncompared to the 3.3 mln hectares planted last year.\n    The change in yield estimates is due to very high\ntemperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in\nthe soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and\nnorthern Buenos Aires province.\n    The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean\npods empty, especially in Cordoba.\n    Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops, since\nrainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas.\n    Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in\nBuenos Aires province, totalling between one and 10 mm. There\nwas no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces.\n    With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields were\nable to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent\nweeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize,\nsunflower and sorghum harvesting.\n    Crops were considered in generally good condition, though\nit is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of\nrecent weeks caused any long-term damage.\n    The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the\ntotal area planted, compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago.\n    Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at\n3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares, down two to seven pct from the 3.85\nmln hectares planted in the previous harvest.\n    Total production for the current maize harvest is expected\nto reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes, versus 10 to 10.2 mln\ntonnes estimated a week ago. The new figure is 21.1 to 22.7 pct\nlower than the 12.8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest,\naccording to official figures.\n    The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of\ntotal planted area, versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago.\n    Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two\nto 2.2 mln hectares, or 29.9 to 36.3 pct lower than the record\n3.14 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.\n    The current harvest's volume was again expected to be\nbetween 2.3 and 2.6 mln tonnes, or 34.1 to 41.5 pct lower than\nlast harvest's record 4.1 mln tonnes.\n    Yields varied widely from area to area, and growers feared\nthat heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on\ncrops and, consequently, on total production volume.\n    The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of\ntotal planted area, compared to four to six pct a week ago.\n    Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1.2 and\n1.3 mln hectares, or 10.3 to 15.2 pct lower than the 1.4 mln\nhectares planted in the previous harvest.\n    Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest\nremained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes again this week, or 16.7 to\n22 pct lower than last harvest's total volume of 4.1 to 4.2 mln\ntonnes.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
