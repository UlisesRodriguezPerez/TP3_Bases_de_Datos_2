        "BODY": "Jordan's key economic priorities are\nhaving a sound national treasury and adequate foreign exchange\nreserves, Prime Minister Zeid al-Rifa'i said.\n    \"First, the national treasury should be in sound shape when\ndealing with the public and other countries so that its\ncredibility is preserved,\" he said in a television interview\nSaturday.\n    \"The second priority is to maintain an acceptable level of\nforeign exchange reserves to provide (the) stability and\nconfidence needed by the government to meet foreign\ncommitments.\"\n    Rifa'i said Jordan's outstanding government-guaranteed and\ncommercial loans total 902 mln dinars with a debt service ratio\nof 14.9 pct.\n    The figure was sharply lower than the 1.02 billion dinars\nin outstanding loans at the end of September, according to\nlatest Central Bank figures.\n    Rifa'i dismissed the view of some bankers and economists\nhere that the dinar, which is pegged to a basket of currencies,\nis overvalued.\n    \"The dinar is strong and stable and we intend to preserve\nits stability,\" he said.\n    The prime minister said he hoped the next Arab summit would\ntackle the question of continuing financial aid to Jordan.\nUnder a 10-year agreement reached in 1978, Jordan was to\nreceive a total of 1.25 billion dlrs annually from Algeria,\nIraq, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab\nEmirates to help it resist Israel.\n    But only Saudi Arabia met its obligations, while the others\nfailed because of falling income due to lower oil prices.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
