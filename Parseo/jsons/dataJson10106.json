        "TITLE": "USX <X> SAYS TALKS ENDED WITH BRITISH PETROLEUM",
        "DATELINE": "    HOUSTON, March 26 - ",
        "BODY": "USX Corp chairman David Roderick said\nthe company had ended talks with British Petroleum Co Plc <BP>\nabout the possible sale of some energy assets and said USX has\nno immediate restructuring plans for its oil businesses.\n    \"We have terminated our discussions,\" Roderick told Reuters\nafter a speech to the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association\nhere. He said USX was not conducting talks with any other\npossible buyer of its energy assets.\n    Earlier today, BP said it planned to offer 70 dlrs per\nshare for the Standard Oil Co's <SRD> publicly held stock.\n    USX said in December the company had held formal\ndiscussions with BP about the potential sale of some of its\noverseas oil assets and USX had received expressions of\ninterest from a half dozen other oil companies.\n    Roderick, in response to a question, said USX had no\nimmediate plans to restructure its Marathon Oil Co, or Texas\nOil and Gas Corp. He said USX also did not plan to sell any of\nits 49 pct interest in the giant Yates Field in west Texas.\n    \"We want to maintain our production in the Yates Field\nduring these difficult times,\" Roderick added.\n    In response to a question, Roderick also said he did not\nknow whether Australian investor Robert Holmes a Court was\naccumulating USX stock. In recent days, traders have suggested\nHolmes a Court was buying additional shares.\n    Roderick said Carl Ichan, who terminated an eight billion\ndlr hostile takeover plan for USX in January, continued to hold\na sizable interest in the company. \"Mr. Ichan still apparently\nhas 11.4 pct. He hasn't bought any more stock or sold any,\"\nRoderick said. \"He's a very satisfied shareholder right now. I\ntalk with him monthly.\"\n    In his speech, Roderick predicted the fall in the value of\nthe dollar would set the stage for the U.S. to solve its trade\ndeficit problem which totaled 170 billion dlrs in 1986.\n    \"I expect by the early 1990s the U.S. will be running a net\ntrade surplus,\" Roderick said. \"I think the worst is over and\nwe can look forward to stability and upward movement ahead.\"\n    However, the USX chairman warned that European trading\npartners may resist the turn in the U.S. trade deficit. \"Some\neconomic discomfort must be transferred from the United States\nto our friends, trading partners and allies.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
