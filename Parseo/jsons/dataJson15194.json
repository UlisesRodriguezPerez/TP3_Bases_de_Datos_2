        "BODY": "Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped\nto maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to\nthe 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite\ncontinuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts\nto extend world penetration.\n    Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln\nguilders, after 265 mln in 1985.\n    Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe's\nleading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,\nsaid sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.\n    The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,\nWhere the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,\nwhere sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.\n    Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker\nforeign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.\n    Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the\nincrease of its stake in leading Spanish brewery <El Aguila\nS.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly\nin French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The\ncompany still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in\nrestructuring and marketing, Heineken said.\n    Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit\nnext year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had\nalready turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.\n    Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the\nEuropean Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer\ninto the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer\nmarket -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. \"We\nhave the beer, but distribution and sales is the important\npoint,\" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken\nhad been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.\n    \"The question is not if we want to penetrate the German\nmarket, but how we are to do it,\" van Schaik said, adding that\nwhile the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a\ntaste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very\nregionalized.\n     Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for\nAfrican operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most\nimportant beer growth markets in the long term.\n     He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with\nmajority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was\nhampered by the lack of hard currencies there.\n    Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters\nper head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions\nand currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total\n1986 sales.\n    On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price\nof imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists\nhave been looking at other possibilities.\n    To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on\nthe Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which\nhad sold successfully, Coebergh said.\n    Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw\nmaterials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were\npopular in Rwanda . \"This is a possibility, but we could not\npossibly achieve the Heineken flavor,\" Coebergh said.\n    Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to\npenetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a\ncontract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.\n    But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's\nmarket potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that\nare enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western\nmoney.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
