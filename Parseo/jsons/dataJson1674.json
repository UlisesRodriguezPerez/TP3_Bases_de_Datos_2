        "DATELINE": "    WINNIPEG, March 4 - ",
        "BODY": "The Canadian Wheat Board has advised\nthe federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid to\nfarmers for their wheat, oats, and barley in the crop year\nbeginning August 1, a board spokesman said.\n    The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommended\nprice drops but said it would not be good news for western\nCanadian grain growers.\n    \"They're all lower,\" he said. \"This is really getting\npretty serious. We're talking nuts and bolts economic survival\nand whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop.\"\n    Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will\nrecommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices.\n    Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is\ndelivered to the elevators used by the wheat board.\n    If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada's grain,\nobtains higher than expected prices on world markets, the\nfarmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. If\nprices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference.\n    The final decision on the initial prices, usually made in\nApril, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the\nfederal cabinet.\n    Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27\npct but last fall the government announced a one billion\nCanadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts.\n    But federal agricultural officials have already warned\nfarmers not to depend on additional government aid this year.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
