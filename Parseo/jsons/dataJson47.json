        "DATELINE": "    RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb 26 - Brazil's \"Cruzado\" anti- ",
        "BODY": "inflation\nplan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the\neconomy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring\nprices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis.\n    Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed the\nvalue of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread\nindexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250\npct inflation rate.\n    But within a year the plan has all but collapsed.\n    \"The situation now is worse than it was. Although there was\ninflation, at least the economy worked,\" a leading bank\neconomist said.\n    The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a\ndramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and\n1985 Brazil's annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to\ncover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr\nforeign debt.\n    For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on\ntarget for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging one\nbillion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and imports\nincreased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus\nplunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged\nunder 150 mln.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
