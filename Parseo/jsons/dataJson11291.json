        "DATELINE": "    VIENNA, March 31 - ",
        "BODY": "The Institute for Economic Research\n(WIFO) said it has cut its forecast for Austria's 1987 gross\ndomestic product growth to a real one pct from a two pct\nforecast made last December.\n    WIFO chief Helmut Kramer told a new conference that he saw\nthe one pct figure, which compares with 1.8 pct last year, as\nthe upper limit of growth. The institute had made the revision\ndue to poor prospects for Austrian exports, he added.\n    A collapse in sales to the Eastern European and oil\nproducing states, combined with the effects of the dollar's\nfall, mean exports overall are unlikely to rise this year.\n    Kramer said domestic demand alone would fuel growth this\nyear. After last year's 2.8 pct rise in real incomes, private\nconsumption was likely to rise 2.25 pct in 1987 after 1.9 pct\nin 1986, despite a present trend towards higher savings.\n    Unemployment was likely to rise to almost six pct from 5.2\npct last year due to the slack economic activity.\n    Kramer said the current account was likely to run a deficit\nof about four billion schillings compared with a 2.6 billion\nsurplus recorded last year. The National Bank, Austria's\ncentral bank, last month forecast the current account would be\nroughly in balance this year.\n    However, Kramer said the lower economic growth should have\nno notable effect on the government's attempts to cut the\nbudget deficit. This year's aim of reducing the deficit to 4.9\npct of GDP from 5.1 pct in 1986 could still be achieved, he\nsaid.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
