        "BODY": "Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, facing\nan increasingly violent wave of labour unrest, has told\nSpaniards he is determined to bring down inflation even if it\nmeans slower growth and fewer votes for his Socialist Party.\n    In a 50-minute television interview broadcast live,\nGonzalez criticized widespread protests which have blown up\nless than a year after he won a resounding general election\nvictory.\n    \"It seems so important to us that sometimes I ask myself\n'Why don't they understand when I explain this?'\" Gonzalez said\nof the anti-inflation strategy designed to modernise Spain and\nmake its economy competitive within the European Community.\n    Gonzalez said the illegal work-to-rule at the airline was\ngrounding more and more planes and producing a backlog of\nmaintenance work which would not be cleared until the summer.\n    \"The comfortable thing to do would be to give in and have no\nproblems,\" the 44-year-old prime minister said, adding that\nnothing could justify the use of violence in a democracy.\n    Gonzalez said he still believed it was possible to reduce\ninflation to five pct this year from the current rate of 6.3\npct, even though other government officials have admitted the\ntarget may now be beyond reach.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
