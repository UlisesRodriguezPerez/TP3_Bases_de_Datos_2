        "BODY": "ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc  has\nabout 500 mln dlrs in cash and another 1.50 billion dlrs in\navailable credit, which it intends to use to buy a\npharmaceutical company, Chairman Milan Panic said.\n    At the company's annual meeting, he said an acquisition\ncould take place in the next 24 months.\n    \"The company has nearly two billion dlrs available for\nacquisition today,\" Panic said, adding, \"We are investigating a\nnumber of companies.\" One company being studied could possibly\nbe acquired on a friendly basis, he said.\n    Panic also said he intends to seek board approval today to\nrepurchase up to three mln ICN common shares.\n    Discussing the possibility of an acquisition, Panic said\nthe such a purchase is necessary because ICN's current\nmarketing capability would not be sufficient to support\ndistribution of the company's products, given ICN's\nexpectations for market growth worldwide.\n    ICN's principal product is ribavirin, also known as\nVirazole. The drug is marketed in a number of countries and\ndescribed as a broad-based anti-viral.\n    The company has said its possible applications include\ntreatment of some types of hepatitis, herpes, influenza,\nchildhood diseases and hemorrhagic fevers.\n    ICN has been the focus of consirable investor attention in\nrecent months because of Virazole, which has undergone clinical\ntrials as a possible treatment of some AIDS-related diseases.\n    Panic said today he would not discuss the drug with regard\nto AIDS until the Food and Drug Administration completes its\nreview of data submitted by the company.\n    He said an investigation of the drug being conducted by a\nHouse Subcommittee is continuing.\n    The subcommittee and the FDA have acknowledged they are\nconducting separate investigations to determine whether or not\nICN witheld data from the FDA on adverse reactions to the drug.\n    Virazole is approved for marketing in the U.S. in aerosol\nform as a treatment for an infection that strikes infants,\ncalled respiratory syncytial virus.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
