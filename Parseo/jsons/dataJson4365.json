        "BODY": "Solv-Ex Corp said it\nsuccessfully completed its oil sands pilot testing program\nunder its agreement with Shell Canada Limited <SHC> and\nreceived a 250,000 U.S. dlr bonus payment.\n    It also said that Shell Canada exercised its option to take\nover Solv-Ex's 25 pct working interest in the construction of\nthe oil facility, relieving it of its obligation to raise about\n62.5 mln Canadian dlrs for plant construction.\n    It said 30 pct of that loan was guaranteed by the\nGovernment of Alberta.\n    In exchange for Shell's participation, Solv-Ex said Shell\nis obligated to pay it an up-front royalty and a running\nroyalty based on the operating profits of the oil sands\nfacility. It said the Shell Canada 7,500 barrel per day oil\nsands project will be built on Shell's oil sand lease about 40\nmiles north of Fort McMurray in the Athabasca region of\nnorthern Alberta.\n    Solv-Ex said the project will cost about 260 mln Canadian\ndlrs. It said that following a final feasibility study the\nplant should open in the early 1990s when oil prices are\nexpected to exceed 20 U.S. dlrs per barrel.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003"
