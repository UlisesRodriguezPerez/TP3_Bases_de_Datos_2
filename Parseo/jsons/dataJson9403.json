        "BODY": "Navistar International Corp chairman\nDonald Lennox repeated that benefits from recapitalization are\nlikely to boost future earnings for fiscal 1987.\n    Lennox told the annual meeting that future quarterly and\nfull year earnings from ongoing operations should be\n\"significantly above 1986 results.\"\n    In his remarks, Lennox said management has no plans to\nrecommend reinstatement of the company's common stock dividend\nin the foreseeable future.\n    He said the outlook for the medium duty truck market\ncontinues to point to little or no change. But recent order\nreceipts indicate a \"firmer tone in the heavy duty truck\nsegment,\" which could result in a five to eight pct increase in\nindustry shipments for the full year, he said.\n    After restructuring under the holding company format, the\ncompany's present truck and engine subsidiary will be known as\nNavistar International Transportation Corp. Neil Springer\ncurrently president and chief operating officer of Navistar\nInternational was named chairman of the new subsidiary.\n    James Cotting, now vice chairman and chief financial\nofficer, was named to succeed Lennox as chairman and chief\nexecutive officer of Navistar International Corp. Lennox will\nretire March 31.\n    Shareholders at the meeting approved a change in the\ncompany's structure to a holding company format, to be\neffective April 1.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
