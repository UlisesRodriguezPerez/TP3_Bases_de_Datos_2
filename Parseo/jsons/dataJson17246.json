        "TITLE": "SIGN OF SLOWING IN GERMAN MONEY GROWTH -BUNDESBANK",
        "DATELINE": "    FRANKFURT, April 27 - ",
        "BODY": "Central bank money stock was growing\nat about seven pct in the first quarter of 1987, down from\n9-1/2 pct in the second half of 1986, so there are signs that\nthe pace of growth is slowing even though it is still above\ntarget, the Bundesbank said in its 1986 annual report.\n    The Bundesbank set a target range of three to six pct\ngrowth from fourth quarter 1986 to fourth quarter 1987 for\ncentral bank money stock. In the previous year it grew 7.7 pct,\noutside the 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 pct target range.\n    The Bundesbank noted that monetary policy in 1986 was\nlimited by a series of external factors.\n    These included the revaluation of the mark, growing foreign\npayments surpluses of non-banks, and currency inflows.\n    The Bundesbank therefore tolerated the monetary overshoot\nin 1986, as an attempt to counter monetary expansion with\ninterest rate and liquidity moves would have increased upward\npressure on the mark, it said.\n    The lower end of the 1987 target range would be realistic\nif a large part of funds currently held in a liquid form were\ninvested in long-term bank accounts or bonds, public bonds or\nforeign securities, the Bundesbank said.\n    But if companies and private households continue to hold\ntheir funds in liquid forms, or if there are further currency\ninflows, growth will be closer to the upper end of the range.\n    \"The more the conflict between external constraints and\ndomestic objectives relaxes -- and many things point to this at\nthe time of writing this report -- the more possible it will be\nto do justice again to the medium-term concept of money supply\ncontrol,\" the Bundesbank said.\n    It noted that prices were beginning to tend upwards again\nat the start of 1987.\n    There would be virtually no easing of other production\ncosts in 1987 to compensate for the rise in unit-wage costs.\n    \"Nevertheless, no inflationary trends are likely to set in\nthis year,\" the Bundesbank said.\n    A link between excessive monetary growth and intensifying\nprice rises can only be observed in the long term, it added.\n    The continuing trend for non-banks to switch into long-term\nborrowing to take advantage of low interest rates, while for\nthe same reason shunning long-term investments, increases the\nrisks in changing interest rates for banks refinancing\nthemselves with variable-interest deposits, it added.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
