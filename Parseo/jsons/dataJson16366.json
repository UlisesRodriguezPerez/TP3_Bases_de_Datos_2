        "BODY": "Kuwait has agreed to charter tankers\nfrom the Soviet Union in a move to protect its oil exports\nthrough the Mideast Gulf, diplomatic sources said.\n    They said the agreement followed months of talks with the\nSoviet Union and the U.S. On ways to secure its oil exports\nafter Iran started to attack Kuwaiti-connected vessels in\nretaliation for Kuwait's backing for Iran's war enemy Iraq.\n    Diplomats said they expect three Soviet tankers initially\nto reinforce other flags already supporting Kuwait's 22-tanker\nfleet.\n    The diplomats said they knew of no deal for Moscow to\nprovide a naval escort for its own vessels, but \"the idea of\nprotection is implicit,\" one said.\n    They said Soviet cargo ships bound for Kuwait in the past\nto unload arms and materiel for road delivery to Iraq were\nknown to have sailed under escort. So far, none of the Soviet\nships are known to have been attacked by Iran. Diplomats said\nthey expected the chartered Soviet tankers to sail between\nKuwait and Khor Fakkan on the United Arab Emirates (UAE) coast\na short way outside the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the\nGulf.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
