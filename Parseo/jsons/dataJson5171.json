        "BODY": "Saudi Arabian business\nleaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing out\nproblems facing the private sector of the kingdom's\noil-dependent economy.\n    The meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across Saudi\nArabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry and\ncommerce following the OPEC pact to boost world oil prices.\n    The four-day conference in this resort town, high in the\nmountains above the Tihamah plain stretching to the Red Sea,\nhas been organised by Saudi Arabia's chambers of commerce.\n    Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail and Commerce\nMinister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim will attend the first day.\n    Bankers and businessmen said the conference will air\nproblems facing commerce and industry after last year's slide\nin oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment in\na private sector sorely short of finance.\n    Government planners have long recognised that Saudi Arabia,\nthe world's largest crude exporter, needs to foster private\nenterprise to diversify its oil-based economy.\n    The fledgling private sector was hard hit by the Middle\nEast recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturing\nand trading companies ran into problems repaying loans.\n    Renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accord\nreached by OPEC last December to curb oil output and boost\nprices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel.\n    With oil prices recovering, Saudi Arabia went ahead at the\nturn of the year with long-delayed budget plans incorporating a\n52.7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing down\nforeign reserves.\n    The simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure of\nconfidence to the business community.\n    Some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since last\nNovember, while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in the\nnumber of new non-performing loans.\n    But not all bankers are convinced. One senior corporate\nfinance manager in Riyadh said: \"Banks are still reluctant to\nlend ... There is certainly more optimism in the air, but I am\nnot sure if it is firmly based.\"\n    Some businessmen and bankers point out that government\nspending is still under tight control and the non-oil economy\nmay still be contracting.\n    Capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply.\nA U.S. Embassy report on Saudi Arabia published just before the\nbudget said: \"While industrialisation has continued to be one of\nthe government's highest priorities, the recession, the\npayments problem and the lack of financing have reduced Saudi\nand foreign investor interest in industry.\"\n    It is the lack of fresh investment that is expected to be a\nmajor issue among the businessmen gathered here.\n    Official figures show the number of new licences for\nindustrial ventures fell 24 pct in the six months to March\n1986, compared with the same period in 1985.\n    Lending by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, a major\nsource of industry backing, has fallen steadily since 1983.\n    Trading companies have also been hit, some caught with huge\ninventories of construction equipment as recession bit.\n    Some firms laid off workers and cut bloated inventories.\nOthers have effectively been liquidated. A few have reached\nagreement with bankers to extend debt repayments.\n    The latest rescheduling is for the shipping-to-hotels\nconglomerate REDEC. Its negotiators have just initialled a\ndraft accord to restructure payments on 1.3 billion riyals of\nbank debt.\n    Bankers and businessmen said the conference was also likely\nto discuss the apparent reluctance of U.S. And British firms to\nstep up investment in the kingdom.\n    A British government delegation has just left Riyadh after\nholding preliminary talks on ways of offsetting the huge Saudi\noutlay on a defence contract to supply 132 fighter aircraft\nworth five billion stg.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
