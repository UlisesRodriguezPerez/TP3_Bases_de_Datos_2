        "BODY": "The United States is prepared to \"pull out\nall the stops\" to defend its agricultural trade rights under the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassador\nto GATT Michael Samuels said.\n    Those rights are now being challenged by the European\nCommunity's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told a\nconference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.\n    He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate if\nthe EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without\nthe issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.\n    The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effect\non January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat\nshipments into the EC.\n    The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.\ntrade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseed\nprices over the current market level and which may be extended\nto include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.\n    Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,\nan aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade\nnegotiations, \"is meaningless if import barriers continue to be\nerected,\" Samuels said.\n    Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm\nsubsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, \"visionary\"\nand \"very serious.\"  The EC and Japan have said it is\nunrealistic.\n    The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal\non farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formally\nnext week.\n    The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce\ntensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals\nsubstitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of\nfarm subsidies.\n    The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as\nthey are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major\ntrade distortions, Samuels said.\n    Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally\nsubmitted and respond to it officially then.\n    \"We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este\ndeclaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,\"\nthe U.S. Ambassador said.\n    The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores\nthe U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.\n    The key difference between the two approaches is that the\nU.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushing\nonly for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.\n    If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,\nthere would be little incentive for the Community to work to\ncorrect the international trade situation, he added.\n    Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the EC\noilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to\nthird countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the\nU.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
