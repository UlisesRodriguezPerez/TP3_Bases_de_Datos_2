        "BODY": "Nippon Oil Co Ltd <NPOL.T> predicted\nparent company net profit of about nine billion yen in the year\nending March 31, down 10.4 pct from a year earlier, president\nYasuoki Takeuchi told a press conference.\n    Current profit for the year was estimated at 17 to 18\nbillion yen, down 20 to 24 pct from a year earlier, he said.\n    Takeuchi said sales are expected to fall 40 pct to 1,700\nbillion yen for the fifth consecutive year-on-year drop. This\nyear's fall was due to lower selling prices for end-users,\nwhich more than offset the yen's appreciation. The company will\nretain six yen dividend for 1986/87.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
