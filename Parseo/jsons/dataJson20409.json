        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - ",
        "BODY": "Donald Regan, President Reagan's\nformer chief of staff, said the government should loosen the\nmoney supply, try to keep interest rates down and try to reduce\nthe federal budget and trade deficits to avoid a recession.\n    \"I think what we have to face now is trying to preserve our\neconomy,\" the one-time chairman of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc\n<MER> said in an interview on the ABC television network.\n    \"We've got to loosen money, we've got to keep interest rates\ndown. We can't afford to let them go up. That means we're going\nto have to work on our twin deficits, both the budget deficit\nand the trade deficit,\" Regan said.\n     \"I certainly wouldn't tighten money at this particular\nmoment,\" Regan said when asked about the prospects for a\nrecession following Monday's price drop on Wall Street.\n    \"I think that if they were to do that, they'd create the\nsame conditions that we did in '29...They choked off the money\nsupply and what happened? We went into a major recession. I\nthink that's the one thing we've got to avoid right now.\"\n    Regan also called on the government to impose restrictions\non program trading. \"I think that that's exacerbated,\nexaggerated this decline, and I think it's something that they\nmust stop,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
