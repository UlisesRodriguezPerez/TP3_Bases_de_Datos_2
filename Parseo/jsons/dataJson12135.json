        "BODY": "Drilling of this year's British sugar\nbeet crop got off to a slow start due to poor weather\nconditions with only around one pct sown so far, a spokesman\nfor British Sugar Plc said.\n    This compares with two pct at the same stage last year,\nthree pct in 1985 and 38 to 39 pct in 1984.\n    There is little cause for concern with better weather\nforecast and the capacity available to drill the contracted\narea of around 200,000 hectares in about 10 days. Seed beds\nlook good and farmers are advised to wait for soil temperatures\nto rise, the spokesman said.\n    \"If the crop can be drilled by the third week in April we\nwill be delighted,\" he said. Last year a large proportion of the\ncrop was not drilled until May but it still turned out to be\nthe equal second largest on record.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
