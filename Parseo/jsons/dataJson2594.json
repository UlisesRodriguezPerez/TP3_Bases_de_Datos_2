        "BODY": "U.K. Officials are studying the possible\nlink between the use of antibiotics in calf feeds and the\nspread of drug-resistant strains of salmonella in humans, a\nMinistry of Agriculture official said.\n    A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine\nyesterday stated that the spread of an unusual strain of\nsalmonella that is resistant to the drug chloramphenicol had\nbeen shown to be linked to farms that used the drug to promote\nthe growth of cattle.\n   The U.K. Ministry of Agriculture is working with the\nDepartment of Health and the Public Health Laboratory to\ninvestigate the whole subject of resistant strains of\nsalmonella.\n    \"The Ministry of Agriculture is concerned about the possible\neffects on human and animal health,\" the official said. The\ngovernment is also studying a recommendation from the Farm\nAnimal Welfare Council (FAWC) to restrict the trade of calves\nunder 56 days old through markets. The FAWC says this would\nhelp reduce the spread of salmonella.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
