        "TITLE": "FORD <F> DEVELOPING ALUMINUM CAR FRAME",
        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, April 17 - ",
        "BODY": "Ford Motor Co said it is developing an\naluminum space frame for its Probe V concept car using extruded\nstretch-formed aluminum that could lead to new techniques for\nbuilding production cars in the future.\n    It said the frame would reduce vehicle weight and cost\nwhile maintaining structural integrity and crashworthiness. The\nframe has fewer parts than conventional steel frames, Ford\nsaid.  The company said the lighter weight would allow smaller\npowertrains and suspensions, further reducing weight and\nimproving fuel economy.\n    Ford said in addition, extrusion dies cost 1,000 to 12,000\ndlrs each, compared with hundreds of thousands of dollars for\nsteel stamping dies, and using extruded aluminum the number of\nwelds in a car could be reduced to about 40 from over 2,000.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
