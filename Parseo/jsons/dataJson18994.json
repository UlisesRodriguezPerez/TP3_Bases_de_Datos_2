        "BODY": "Strong growth in domestic demand was a key\nfeature of the economies of southern European countries in\n1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, the\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.\n    In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal's total\ndomestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to\nfive pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth\nrestrained private consumption.\n    Turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and\ndomestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expected\nto be halved to five pct next year.\n    In Spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment,\nhad been the driving force behind rapid growth in Gross\nDomestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumption\nwere expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain\nstrong.\n    The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply\nnext year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the European\nCommunity and declining competitiveness.\n    In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwards\nfollowing an increase early this year linked with the\nintroduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices due\nto cold weather.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
