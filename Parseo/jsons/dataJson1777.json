        "BODY": "Whether the Soviet Union will fulfill\nits buying obligations under the U.S./USSR grains agreement\ndepends entirely on the United States, a Soviet trade official\ntold Reuters.\n    \"How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreement\nif the United States does not want to offer us grain at\ncompetitive prices?\" said Albert Melnikov, deputy trade\nrepresentative of the Soviet Union to the United States.\n    \"We are in the market for grains, but it is up to the\nUnited States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitive\nprices,\" he said in an interview.\n    Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up the\nagreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain at\nprevailing market prices.\n    \"We are being accused of not implementing this agreement.\nWe do not consider we are at fault,\" Melnikov said.\n    Article I in the agreement states that \"purchases/sales of\ncommodities under this Agreement will be made at the market\nprice prevailing for these products at the time of\npurchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms.\"\n    \"The United States should supply to the Soviet Union\ndefinite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is the\nUnited States ready to supply this?\" he said.\n    The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand has\nbeen met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn, which he\nconfirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes, but said that if U.S. corn prices\nremain competitive, the Soviets will buy more if they need it.\n    Wheat buying, however, is a different story, Melnikov said.\n    \"If the United States is interested in selling its wheat,\nthen they must offer competitive prices, and it's up to the\nUnited States to decide how these competitive prices will be\noffered,\" he said.\n    Last year's U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Soviets\nwas rejected because of an insufficient subsidy, Melnikov said.\nHe said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer,\nU.S. wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
