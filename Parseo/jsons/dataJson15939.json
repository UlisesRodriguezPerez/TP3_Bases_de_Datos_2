        "BODY": "The United States' dependency on\nforeign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,\naccording to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry\nResearch Associates.\n    Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference\nhere, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much\nas 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high\nlevel of 47 pct in 1977.\n    \"The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is\ninevitable,\" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil\nimports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.\n    Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for\n33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to\n40 pct by 1990.\n    \"However, the rate of this growth can be affected\npositively or negatively through government action or\ninaction,\" Lichtblau said.\n    He said that one of the government's negative actions is\nthe maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a\ndisincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash\nflow for oil exploration.\n    Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor\nprice for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.\n    \"An international floor price adopted by all or most\nindustrial countries would clearly be a much more effective\nmeasure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if\nwe imposed it alone,\" Lichtblau said.\n    Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic\nfuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen\nU.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.\n    A potential for alternative supplies could limit the\nwillingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.\n    Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer\ntax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic\nPetroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans\nfor alternative energy.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
