        "BODY": "The Pakistani government allowed the\nprivate sector to export cotton and rice in a new trade policy\nannounced to cover the next three years.\n    Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a\ntelevised speech it was also decided to allow duty-free import\nof cotton yarn.\n    Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have\nbeen handled exclusively by state corporations since early\n1970s. Haq said now the private sector would export cotton and\nrice along with the state corporations.\n    He said duty-free import of cotton yarn was allowed to make\nhigh quality yarn available to local ancillary industries and\nto enable them to compete effectively in the world market. This\nwould help overcome domestic shortages of yarn, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
