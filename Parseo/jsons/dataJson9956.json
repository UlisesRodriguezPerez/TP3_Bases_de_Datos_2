        "BODY": "Ford Motor Co neared General Motors\nCorp last year in executive bonuses, while it topped the larger\nautomaker in profit sharing payments to workers.\n    Ford, which outstripped GM in earnings last year, said its\n1986 incentive bonuses totaled 167 mln dlrs, slightly behind\nGeneral Motors' 169.1 mln.\n    General Motors, however, did not make any profit-sharing\npayments to its workers, while Ford made a profit-sharing\ndistribution of 372 mln dlrs, or 2,100 dlrs per worker.\n    General Motors, which saw its earnings drop to 2.94 billion\ndlrs from 1985's 3.99 billion, said the 1986 profit was \"not\nsufficient to generate a payout under the profit-sharing\nformula.\"\n    Ford, which earned 3.28 billion dlrs in 1986, up from 2.51\nbillion in 1985, said it \"recognizes employees' efforts and\nfulfills its commitment to them in many ways, including\nprofit-sharing.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
