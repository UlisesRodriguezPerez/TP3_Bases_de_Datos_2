        "BODY": "Continental Illinois Corp said if the\nBrazilian debt moratorium remains in effect, it may place its\nmedium and long term loans to Brazil on a cash basis.\n    This would increase non-performing loans by about 380 mln\ndlrs and reduce income before taxes and net income by about 10\nmln dlrs in the 1987 first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full\nyear, company officials told a press briefing.\n    Loans to Brazil at 1986 year end totaled 474 mln dlrs,\naccording to the annual report released at the briefing.\n    In February 1987, the Brazilian government, citing a\ndeclining level of foreign currency reserves, declared a\nmoratorium on the payment of interest on the country's medium\nand long term debt obligations.\n    Continental said it may take similar action on its loans to\nEcuador, which total 25 mln dlrs. This would reduce 1987\npre-tax and after-tax net by 800,000 dlrs in the first quarter,\nand by two mln dlrs for the full year, the bank-holding\ncompany's officers said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
