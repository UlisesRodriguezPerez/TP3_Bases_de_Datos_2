        "BODY": "Mining group Boliden AB said it had\nagreed with Saudi state agency General Petroleum and Mineral\nOrganisation (Petromin) to open a gold mine in Saudi Arabia to\nexploit one of the world's richest deposits of the metal.\n    Boliden spokesman Goran Paulson told Reuters the Swedish\ngroup would  be responsible for the technical side of the\noperation and would have no control over the product itself.\n    He said one option under discussion for refining the gold\nore would be to ship it to Boliden's Ronnskar copper smelter in\nnorthern Sweden.\n    Paulson declined to give a figure for the deal but said it\nwas strategically important since it increased Boliden's\npresence in Saudi Arabia.\n    \"Representatives from Petromin have visited Ronnskar\nalready...We see Saudi Arabia as the expansion area of the\nfuture,\" he said.\n    The new mine, which is being developed at Mahd adh Dhahab\nin the west of the country and should open in the first half of\n1988, would have an annual output of about 3,000 kilos of gold\nsmelted from around 120,000 tons of ore, he said.\n    Boliden already owns 50 pct of a gold ore deposit in Saudi\nArabia, but the new venture will be the first Saudi mine to\nopen in modern times.\n    \"This is a breakthrough for Boliden's sales of mining\ntechnology and knowhow,\" said the group's chief executive, Kjell\nNilsson.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
