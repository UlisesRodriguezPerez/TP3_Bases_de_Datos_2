        "BODY": "The Tanzanian government, in its\nsecond annual budget since embarking on an economic recovery\nprogram inspired by the International Monetary Fund, announced\nincreases in fuel prices and sales tax and higher levies on\ngovernment services.\n    Finance Minister Cleopa Msuya said the government expected\nto spend 77.33 billion shillings in the financial year 1987/8,\n39 pct more than this year's estimate. Revenue would provide\n48.84 billion shillings, leaving a deficit of 28.49 billion to\nbe financed through domestic and foreign loans.\n    This year's budget initially projected a deficit of only\n3.35 billion shillings but in mid-year the government had to\nimpose new taxes to keep the deficit roughly on target. No\nfigure for the final deficit was avaialble.\n    The budget gave civil servants a 20 pct pay rise with\neffect from July 1, to compensate for inflation of more than 30\npct.\n    Msuya said regular petrol would go up 52 pct, with similar\nincreases in the cost of premium and kerosene. Diesel would\nrise by 75 pct.\n    The higher levies affect official transactions such as road\ntolls, vehicle transfers and various licence fees, he added.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
