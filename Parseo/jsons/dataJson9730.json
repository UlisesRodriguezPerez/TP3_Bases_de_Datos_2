        "BODY": "The Bank of France said it set a money\nmarket intervention tender today to inject funds to the market\nagainst first category paper.\n    Money market sources said the surprise announcement might\nherald a quarter percentage point cut in the central bank\nintervention rate from the 7-3/4 pct level set March 10, but\nthey added such a cut was relatively unlikely.\n    The intervention rate was cut from eight pct on March 10\nafter being raised from 7-1/4 pct on January 2 to head off\nspeculative pressure against the franc.\n    Dealers said market fundamentals could justify a further\neasing, but a combination of technical factors and renewed\ncurrency uncertainties surrounding the dollar had put\nshort-term upside pressure on interest rates in recent\nsessions.\n    Call money rose yesterday to 7-7/8 eight pct from 7-3/4 7/8\npct. Today it was first indicated at 8-1/8 1/4 before easing on\nnews of the tender to 7-13/16 7/8 pct.\n    Technical factors making for a slight shortage of liquidity\nin the market included the settlement yesterday of the latest\nmonthly treasury tap stock tender, on March 5, market sources\nsaid.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
