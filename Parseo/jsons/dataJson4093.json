        "BODY": "Taiwan's new controls on currency\ninflows, implemented today, are a desperate bid to stem a flood\nof speculative money prompted by the local currency surge\nagainst the U.S. Dollar, local and foreign bankers said.\n    The central bank now has to clear remittances exceeding one\nmln U.S. Dlrs earned from exports, shipping and insurance and\nbank lending plus remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from any\nother source.\n    Petitioners have to show their remittances relate to\ngenuine commercial transactions.\n    Meanwhile, traders are no longer required to report all\noutward payments concerning invisible trade, including freight,\ninsurance and royalties, to the central bank.\n    But bankers said they believed the new controls would be\nineffective since businessmen could split up remittances into\nsmaller units or simply remit money through Taiwan's\nflourishing currency black market.\n    The bankers said the controls, announced on March 6, are a\npanic reaction to U.S. Pressure, which has intensified over the\npast week, for a faster appreciation of the Taiwan dollar to\nslow the growth of Taiwan's exports to the U.S.\n    The government has denied local press reports Washington is\npressing for an exchange rate of up to 28 dlrs.\n    The Taiwan dollar opened four cents up today at 34.70.\n    \"I don't think the central bank has a final target,\" said an\nexecutive with a U.S. Bank. Other bankers and economists said\nthey are wary of making any firm predictions about how far the\nTaiwan dollar will rise.\n    Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. Hit 13.6 billion U.S.\nDlrs last year against 10.2 billion in 1985. The surplus\nwidened in the first two months of the year to 2.35 billion\ndlrs from 1.87 billion in the same period last year.\n    Economists estimate up to five billion dlrs in speculative\nmoney flowed into Taiwan in 1986.\n    This inflow helped boost foreign exchange reserves to more\nthan 51 billion dlrs from just under 25 billion this time last\nyear and provided further upward pressure on the currency.\n    The Taiwan dollar has appreciated by almost 15 pct against\nthe U.S. Currency since September 1985, further encouraging\nspeculators.\n    Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng said last week\nWashington's pressure plus rising foreign exchange reserves\nmeant a further strengthening in the currency is inevitable.\n    Many local bankers argue the only effective solution to the\ncurrency problem is to drop foreign exchange controls and allow\nthe local dollar to find its own level.\n    \"Lifting exchange controls is the final answer, but the\ncentral bank is not prepared to do it. It simply does not want\nto take the risk,\" said one local banker.\n    He said he believed the new restrictions are a temporary\nmeasure designed to buy time as the central bank grapples with\nthe exchange rate problem.\n    The restrictions are a bureaucratic imposition and skirt\naround the real issue, he said.\n    Taiwan needs a fundamental restructuring of foreign\nexchange controls, said an executive with a western bank.\n    \"The controls will create more paperwork, but the extra bank\ncharges will not outweigh the profits of speculation,\" said the\nmanager of a European bank.\n    Economists criticised the controls, saying they could\nantagonise Washington, which is pushing for further economic\nliberalisation in Taiwan.\n    \"Instead of liberalising outflows, the government has\nrestricted inflows,\" said Kate Newman, an economist with Vickers\nda Costa.\n    A local banker, who declined to be named, said, \"It's\nbasically ridiculous. It's a backward movement and goes against\nthe government's liberalisation programme.\"\n    Taiwan last year eased some of its financial regulations to\nenable Taiwan nationals to invest in foreign government bonds,\ntreasury bills and certificates of deposit and to allow\nindividuals to take 5,000 U.S. Dlrs in cash out of the country\neach year.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
