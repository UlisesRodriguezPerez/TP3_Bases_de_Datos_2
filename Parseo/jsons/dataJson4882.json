        "BODY": "U.S. Trade Representative Clayton\nYeutter said that whether the exchange rate of the dollar would\nfall or rise in the coming decade would depend on nations'\nfinancial, monetary and tax policies.\n    But, he said, in a speech and remarks to the Heritage\nFoundation, that in the end \"the marketplace will ultimately\nrule the day.\"\n    Asked about the future of the dollar, he said that whether\nor not it would rise or fall depended on economic policies and\ncoooperation among trading nations.\n    Yeutter said \"if nations do the right kinds of things in\nfinancial, monetary and tax policies, then a lesser burden of\nadjustment is placed on exchange rates, and one could envision\na situation of the major trading nations moving back far closer\nto what most of us would consider equilibrium and exchange\nrates becoming relatively stable.\"\n    But he said, on the other hand, that if nations did not\nexhibit greater self discipline and international cooperation,\n\"It is simply inevitable that the exchange rates will make that\nadjustment.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
