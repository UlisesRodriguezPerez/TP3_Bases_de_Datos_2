        "DATELINE": "    LUXEMBOURG, April 29 - ",
        "BODY": "Belgian Agriculture Minister Paul de\nKeersmaeker said he would review EC Commission proposals for a\ntax on imported and EC produced vegetable oils and fats in the\nlight of objections made by certain EC member states.\n    De Keersmaeker, current chairman of the EC farm ministers'\ncouncil, was speaking after a three-day meeting of ministers at\nwhich the tax proposal was one of the key themes.\n    He said he would review the position as part of plans to\npresent compromise proposals for the 1987/88 farm price package\nto the next meeting, starting in Brussels on May 18.\n    De Keersmaeker, who said there was \"a great deal of\nresistance in many delegations\" to the tax, declined to say what\naspects of the proposals he would review.\n    However, EC Commission sources said they are expected to\ninclude the question of whether it should apply to marine oils.\n    They said Denmark and Portugal might agree to the tax, to\nbe set initially at 330 Ecus a tonne, if these oils, of which\nthey are major producers, were excluded.\n    The sources said, however, that Britain, the Netherlands\nand West Germany continue to have strong objections to the tax,\npartly because of fears that its impact on U.S. Soybean exports\ncould provoke transatlantic trade friction.\n    They said that, if these three countries held firm to this\nposition, they would be able to block the proposal under the\nEC's majority voting mechanism.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
