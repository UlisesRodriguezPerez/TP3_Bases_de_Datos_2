        "BODY": "Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said\nthe U.K. Was growing more impatient with Japanese trade\nbarriers and warned that it would soon have new powers against\ncountries not offering reciprocal access to their markets.\n    She told Parliament that the bid by the U.K.'s Cable and\nWireless Plc <CAWL.L> to enter the Japanese telecommunications\nmarket was being regarded by her government as a test case.\n    \"I wrote to the prime minister of Japan, Mr Nakasone, on the\nfourth of March to express our interest on the Cable and\nWireless bid. I have not yet had a reply. We see this as a test\non how open the Japanese market really is,\" Thatcher said.\n    Thatcher told Parliament that \"shortly ... We shall have\nmore powers than we have now, when, for example the powers\nunder the Financial Services Act and the Banking Act become\navailable, then we shall be able to take action in cases where\nother countries do not offer the same full access to financial\nservices as we do.\"\n    Cable and Wireless is seeking a stake in the proposed\nJapanese telecommunications rival to Kokusai Denshin Denwa.\n    But the Japanese minister for post and telecommunications\nwas reported as saying that he opposed Cable and Wireless\nhaving a managerial role in the new company.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
