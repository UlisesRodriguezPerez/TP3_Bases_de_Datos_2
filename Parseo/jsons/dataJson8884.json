        "TITLE": "STERLING OUTLOOK CLOUDED BY TEST OF PARIS ACCORD",
        "AUTHOR": "    By Myra MacDonald, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, March 24 - ",
        "BODY": "The move by foreign exchange markets to\ntest the strength of the Paris currency accord has thrown into\nquestion the near-term outlook for sterling, until recently one\nof the main beneficiaries of the agreement, analysts said.\n    Since the six-nation accord last month, sterling has risen\nsharply, adding almost five pct on its trade-weighted index.\n    While the accord effectively stifled dollar/yen and\ndollar/mark movements, the markets turned their attention to\nsterling as foreign investors rushed to take advantage of\nrelatively high U.K. Interest rates.\n    But analysts say the pound has been sidelined by the first\ntentative test of the Paris accord seen yesterday.\n    The market now looks set sooner or later to push the dollar\ndown further in a test of the willingness of central banks to\nintervene. Analysts say if the banks do not intervene\neffectively, the Paris accord could collapse.\n    \"On balance, sterling would be a net sufferer if G-6\ncollapses,\" Phillips and Drew analyst Stephen Lewis said.\n    He said sterling would lose out as markets turned their\nattention to capital movements whereas previously they had been\nrestricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies.\n    However, although most analysts and foreign exchange\ndealers were forecasting a brief period of consolidation or\neven retracement for sterling, none were expecting a very sharp\ndrop in the U.K. Currency.\n    Sterling remained supported by optimism on the U.K.\nPolitical and economic outlook, firmer oil prices and\nrelatively high interest rates, they said.\n    Bullish sentiment on the U.K. Economic outlook has been\nrunning especially high after last week's budget, seen as\npopular both with the markets and with British voters.\n    Sterling was also supported by signs of a weakening in the\nWest German and Japanese economies, where growth for 1987 is\ntrailing behind the three pct forecast for the U.K.\n    Recent opinion polls showing Britain's ruling conservative\nparty ahead of opposition parties in popularity have also\nsupported the pound.\n    In addition, sterling has so far shrugged off two\nhalf-point cuts in U.K. Bank base lending rates in less than\ntwo weeks. A further half-point cut, widely expected in the\nnext week or so, has already been largely discounted.\n    U.K. Base rates, now running at 10 pct, are still\nrelatively high compared to other western countries, and\nanalysts said a further base rate cut to 9-1/2 pct was unlikely\nto affect sterling.\n    Sterling today appeared resilient to the dollar's decline,\ndropping only slightly on a cross-rate basis.\n    Worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchange\nmarkets, however, were reflected in the U.K. Government bond\n(gilt) market, where prices dropped by up to 5/16 point.\n    Until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market has\nbeen one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling.\n    Dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steady\nfor the next few days while the market awaits further\ndevelopments on the dollar and this Thursday's U.K. Current\naccount figures for February.\n    Market forecasts are for a deficit of around 250 mln stg\nafter January's small surplus.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
