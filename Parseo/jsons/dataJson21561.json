        "DATELINE": "    WELLINGTON, Oct 19 - ",
        "BODY": "An income tax surcharge and capital\ngains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of\nthe N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said.\n    Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the\nBank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed to\nrestore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by\ncurrent government policies.\n    The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turn\nwould lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech.\nHe added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could\nbe much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast.\n    Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a\npercentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase was\nprobably unavoidable, Bayliss said.\n    He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct\nvalue-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986,\nbut that would have had a short-term inflationary impact.\nImport tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary\nimpact of a currency depreciation.\n    The government had failed to bring inflation down despite\nlower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added.\n    New Zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year to\nend-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June.\n    The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflation\npolicies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and\ninsufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Bayliss\nsaid. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt\nand debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.\n    \"The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems are\ngoing to take much longer to solve than was originally thought\nis soundly based -- primarily because the government's\nmacro-economic policies have been unsuccessful,\" Bayliss said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
