        "DATELINE": "    FRANKFURT, June 16 - ",
        "BODY": "The Bundesbank could announce today\nthat it will lift its veto on the private holding of European\nCurrency Unit (ECU) liabilities, banking sources said.\n    But this would probably be the only significant news from\ntoday's council session, brought forward from its usual\nThursday date because of the Corpus Christi holiday here. The\nBundesbank is not expected to change credit policy.\n    The sources said Bundesbank officials had been working out\ntechnical and legal problems with the ECU since the subject was\ndiscussed in the presence of federal finance minister Gerhard\nStoltenberg on May 7.\n    With the primary internal work on the ECU completed,\napproval from the 18-member central bank council was now\nvirtually a mere formality, the sources said.\n    Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl, chairing today's\nmeeting, said in mid-May the remaining ECU restrictions were\nlikely to be lifted, allowing individuals to open ECU accounts\nand incur liabilities previously mainly executed through the\nLuxembourg subsidiaries of the major German banks.\n    The sources said the ECU liberalisation was mainly designed\nto show that West Germany was prepared to play its part in the\neffort to attain European Community monetary unity by 1992.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
