        "DATELINE": "    HANOVER, March 31 - ",
        "BODY": "Mannesmann AG <MMWG.F> expects a\ndifficult year for the capital goods industry in 1987, chief\nexecutive Werner Dieter told a news conference.\n    Dieter said West German producers would see a downturn in\nforeign business because of lower energy prices and the higher\nmark, as well as a deterioration of the economies of customer\nnations.\n    Domestic business was also declining and orders for West\nGerman engineering goods have been falling since July 1986,\nDieter said.\n    Mannesmann's profit fell by an undisclosed amount in 1986.\n    Dieter said Mannesmann's pipe activities would suffer a\nset- back, although measures to cut costs, which were started\nlast year, were now having an effect.\n    Dieter noted, however, that pipes and related products\naccounted for less than 30 pct of Mannesmann's turnover. The\ncompany saw good chances in the automation sector, which Dieter\nsaid had become one of Mannesmann's \"strategic aims.\"\n    He said the company's drive to combine activities in\nmechanical and electronic engineering was a particular \"plus\npoint\" for Mannesmann.\n    Mannesmann, which yesterday announced it had agreed to take\na majority stake in the Fichtel und Sachs AG car parts group\nfor an undisclosed sum, saw third party group turnover fall\nnine pct in 1986 to 16.60 billion marks. Its world group net\nprofit in 1985 was 255.9 mln marks.\n    It has blamed the fall in 1986 profits on the weaker dollar\nand lack of demand for steel pipe.\n    Dieter said there were signs that prices for steel pipe\nwere bottoming out and would slowly start to rise, but he added\nthe company would continue to cut personnel in this sector this\nyear.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
