        "BODY": "Weekend rain over the Western Corn Belt\nbrought further relief to crop areas that had been dry earlier\nthis month, and developing weather patterns will bring welcome\nmoisture to central and eastern belt locations this week,\naccording to Dale Mohler, senior meteorologist for Accu-Weather\nInc.\n    \"There is going to be more rain for the next two, three\ndays,\" he said. \"We're in a fairly wet pattern with normal to\nabove normal moisture this week.\"\n    Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southern\nMinnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in eastern\nNebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.\n    Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend but\nwere receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.\n    Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio with\nthudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.\n    \"Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, a\npretty good rain,\" Mohler said.\n    Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparking\nan early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board of\nTrade. Prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with November off\n19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs.\n    Mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt is\nexpected to move over the central Midwest, then move north\nlater in the week. That could bring new rain patterns across\nthe Corn Belt and assure good crop conditions as\nearly-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stage\nin early July, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
