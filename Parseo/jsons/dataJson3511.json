        "BODY": "Traders here and in Paris said the\nresults of today's EC white sugar tender are hard to forecast\nbecause of plans by a group of French, West German, Dutch and\nBelgian operators to sell one mln tonnes of sugar into\nintervention.\n    London traders said bids for licences have been reported\nbetween 43.00 and 44.00 Ecus per 100 kilos and if any licences\nare granted they are likely to be towards the lower end of that\nrange, possibly 43.30/43.50 Ecus.\n    Traders in Paris said they expect maximum rebates of\nbetween 43 and 43.50 Ecus.\n    Other than the Commission releasing no sugar for export,\nthe likely tonnage is expected to be very small, the London\ntraders said, while the French sources declined to estimate\nvolume in view of the psychological impact of the planned sales\ninto intervention in protest against EC export policies.\n    Last week licences for 60,500 tonnes were awarded at a\nmaximum rebate of 43.147 Ecus.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
