        "BODY": "Saudi riyal interbank deposits were\nsteady at yesterday's higher levels in a quiet market.\n    Traders said they were reluctant to take out new positions\namidst uncertainty over whether OPEC will succeed in halting\nthe current decline in oil prices.\n    Oil industry sources said yesterday several Gulf Arab\nproducers had had difficulty selling oil at official OPEC\nprices but Kuwait has said there are no plans for an emergency\nmeeting of the 13-member organisation.\n    A traditional Sunday lull in trading due to the European\nweekend also contributed to the lack of market activity.\n    Spot-next and one-week rates were put at 6-1/4, 5-3/4 pct\nafter quotes ranging between seven, six yesterday.\n    One, three, and six-month deposits were quoted unchanged at\n6-5/8, 3/8, 7-1/8, 6-7/8 and 7-3/8, 1/8 pct respectively.\n    The spot riyal was quietly firmer at 3.7495/98 to the\ndollar after quotes of 3.7500/03 yesterday.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
