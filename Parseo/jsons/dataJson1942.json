        "BODY": "A limited Belgian issue of silver Ecu\ncoins with a face value of five Ecus will go on sale from March\n23 at a price of 500 Belgian francs each, a Finance Ministry\nspokesman said.\n    Gold Ecu coins with a face value of 50 Ecus will be sold\nfrom the same day. The spokesman told Reuters the price for\nthese would be fixed just before they go on sale but was likely\nto be between 8,500 and 9,000 francs.\n    At least two mln silver coins and several hundreds of\nthousands of the gold coins will be minted, he said. They will\nbe sold both in Belgium and abroad.\n    The coins will be the first ever denominated in the Ecu,\nthe \"basket\" comprised of the 12-nation European Community's\ncurrencies except the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo.\n    The issue is being made to mark the 30th anniversary of the\nEC's founding Treaty of Rome this month. Finance Minister Mark\nEyskens, who currently presides over the EC's council of\neconomic and finance ministers, has called the issue a\npolitical act of symbolic value which aimed to make the\nCommunity's goal of monetary integration more concrete.\n    The coins will be legal tender in Belgium but most demand\nis expected to come from coin collectors.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
