        "TITLE": "J.P. MORGAN <JPM> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, TRADING",
        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, April 8 - ",
        "BODY": "J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its\nfirst-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its\npreviously announced decision to place on non-accrual status\nits 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil.\n    That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interest\npayments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20\nmln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the\nfirst three months of 1986.\n    Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities\nunderwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln\ndlrs in the year-earlier period.\n    In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading\nlosses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and\nunderwriting of Euromarket securities.\n    Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained\ndifficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering\nheavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether\nMorgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket.\n    On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan\nlosses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign\nexchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and\ntrust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.\n    Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and\ncommissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net\ninvestment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.\n    Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first\nquarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell\nto 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.\n    If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means\nthat interest can be recorded as income only when payments are\nactually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9\nmln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume\npayments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.\n    After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance for\ncredit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared\nwith 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.\n    It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after\ncharge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49\nmln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.\n    Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were\n583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year\nearlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from\n303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to\npersonnel costs, Morgan said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
