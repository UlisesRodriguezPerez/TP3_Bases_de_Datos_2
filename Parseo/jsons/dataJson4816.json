        "BODY": "The  Ministry of Mines\nhas announced the discovery of a major gold field in Grand Bois\nin Haiti's mineral-rich North.\n    At a press conference yesterday, a Ministry spokesman\nreported the deposit contained an estimated 44 mln tons of ore,\nwith each ton capable of containing 7,666 grams of gold. The\nspokesman gave no estimate of what he thought the find,\ndiscovered on Wednesday, was worth.\n    However, mining could only begin after foreign partners\ninvest eight mln dlrs needed for technical equipment, the\nspokesman said.\n    The Haitian government has never before operated a gold\nmine, but the United Nations has recently completed a three\nyear feasibility study which lists Grand Bois and Morne Bossa\nas sites of important gold deposits.\n    In 1971, the Sedren copper mine in Gonaives, operated by a\nCanadian firm, closed down after years of mining a concentrate\ncontaining gold as well as copper.\n    \"The new Grand Bois mine represents large amounts of money,\"\nsaid a former official of Sedren Mine.\n    \"But like everything else there's a catch. The gold has to\nbe extracted, and first someone has to come up with the money\nto finance the operation,\" the official, who asked not to be\nnamed, told Reuters.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
