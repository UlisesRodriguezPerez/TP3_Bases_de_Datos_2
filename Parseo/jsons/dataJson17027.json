        "DATELINE": "    MADRID, April 21 - ",
        "BODY": "Spanish Secretary of State for the\neconomy Guillermo de la Dehesa said the government maintained\nits five pct inflation target for this year although a 0.6 pct\nincrease in March pushed the rise in the year on year consumer\nprice index to 6.3 pct.\n    De la Dehesa said the March rise, announced today by the\nNational Statistics Institute, was not entirely satisfactory\nbut acceptable.\n    The year on year rate at the end of February was six pct.\nPrices rose 8.3 pct last year.\n    The March rise included a 0.05 pct increase correcting an\nerror in last January's consumer price index. Economists had\nearlier said the error could have been as high as 0.2 pct.\n    De la Dehesa said seasonal increases in food prices pushed\nthe index up in March and he expected the rate to be lower in\nApril.\n    The Communist-led Workers Commissions union said the March\nprice rise showed inflation was going up again and the\ngovernment looked increasingly unlikely to meet its five pct\ntarget.\n    The Workers Commissions said the inflation trend fuelled\nunions's claims to wage increases beyond the government's\nrecomendation to limit wage rises at around five pct.\n    Spain is being affected by a two-month-old wave of strikes\nfor wage rises. Government officials note wage settlements so\nfar this year have yielded average increases upwards of six\npct, while unions say the figure is higher then seven pct.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
