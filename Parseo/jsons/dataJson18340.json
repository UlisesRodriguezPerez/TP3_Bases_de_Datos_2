        "BODY": "The European Community (EC) should\nwatch very carefully for any developments in the Gulf War and\ntheir consequences on the oil market, EC Energy Commissioner\nNicolas Mosar said today.\n    Speaking two weeks after a U.S. warship was attacked in the\nGulf, Mosar warned, \"An escalation in the Gulf would increase\ntensions in the oil market.\"\n    \"But I do not want to be alarmist,\" he told a news conference\nafter an EC energy ministers meeting in Luxembourg.\n    He said the volume of EC oil imports from the Gulf had\ndeclined to around 31 pct of total oil imports in the first\nthree months of 1987 against 35 pct in the same period last\nyear. \"There are also other potential sources of supplies in the\nworld,\" he added.\n    The issue of Gulf oil imports was not discussed at the\nministers' meeting, he added.\n    A EC committee of national experts in the so-called oil\nsupply group would discuss Gulf oil supplies at their bi-annual\nmeeting on June 19, he said.\n    But any major decisions would have to be reserved for EC\nforeign ministers, diplomats said.\n    West European nations have so far shown little enthusiasm\nfor backing a U.S. plan to give military protection to merchant\nships in the Gulf which could help insure the safety of oil\nsupplies.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
