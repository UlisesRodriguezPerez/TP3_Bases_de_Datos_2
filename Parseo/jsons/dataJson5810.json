        "BODY": "Japan has complained to the secretariat\nof the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that South\nKorea's five-year plan to cut its trade deficit with Japan\nbreaks GATT rules, Trade Ministry officials here said.\n    They said Japan submitted a report earlier this month\nalleging South Korea's plan to import less from Japan and more\nfrom the U.S. And elsewhere was tantamount to creating\nnon-tariff trade barriers.\n    South Korea unveiled the plan in November. It said it hoped\nto narrow its trade deficit with Japan to two billion dlrs by\n1991.\n    South Korea's trade deficit with Japan was a record 5.45\nbillion dlrs in 1986, and rose to 752 mln dlrs in the first two\nmonths of 1987 from 727 mln in the same 1986 period.\n    The plan envisages giving incentives to importers not to\nimport Japanese goods, and to exporters to sell more to Japan.\n    The officials said they believed the Japanese action, one\nstep short of filing a suit, was designed to bring South Korea\nto the negotiating table and stop the plan.\n    The Seoul government wants Tokyo to ease various import\nrestrictions and simplify customs inspections for South Korean\ngoods to help reduce the trade deficit.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
