        "BODY": "Dutch cocoa processors are unhappy with\nthe intermittent buying activities of the International Cocoa\nOrganization's buffer stock manager, industry sources told\nReuters.\n    \"The way he is operating at the moment is doing almost\nnothing to support the market. In fact he could be said to be\nactively depressing it,\" one company spokesman said.\n    Including the 3,000 tonnes he acquired on Friday, the total\namount of cocoa bought by the buffer stock manager since he\nrecently began support operations totals 21,000 tonnes.\n    Despite this buying, the price of cocoa is well under the\n1,600 Special Drawing Rights, SDRs, a tonne level below which\nthe bsm is obliged to buy cocoa off the market.\n    \"Even before he started operations, traders estimated the\nmanager would need to buy at least up to his 75,000 tonnes\nmaximum before prices moved up to or above the 1,600 SDR level,\nand yet he appears reluctant to do so,\" one manufacturer said.\n    \"We all hoped the manager would move into the market to buy\nup to 75,000 tonnes in a fairly short period, and then simply\nstep back,\" he added.\n    \"The way the manager is only nibbling at the edge of the\nmarket at the moment is actually depressing sentiment and the\nmarket because everyone is holding back from both buying and\nselling waiting to see what the manager will do next,\" one\nprocessor said.\n    \"As long as his buying tactics remain the same the market is\nlikely to stay in the doldrums, and I see no indication he is\nabout to alter his methods,\" he added.\n    Processors and chocolate manufacturers said consumer prices\nfor cocoa products were unlikely to be affected by buffer stock\nbuying for some time to come.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
