        "BODY": "Israel has drawn up a five-year plan\nfor 1987-1991 to raise agricultural production by 500 mln dlrs\nto 2.7 billion dlrs, an annual rise of 3.4 pct, the Israeli\nMinistry of Agriculture said. Agricultural exports are to be\nincreased by 180 mln dlrs, or 4.8 pct per year on average.\n    The area planted to cotton is to remain at the 1986 level\nof 100,000 to 112,500 acres with exports expected to bring in\n80 to 90 mln dlrs per year. The 34 pct decline from the 1985\nlevel reflects continued water rationing which will remain in\nforce, the ministry said.\n    Groundnut production is planned to increase by 13,000\ntonnes, or 57 pct, by 1991 and exports by 9,000 tonnes, or 82\npct. Maize production is targetted to rise by 48,000 tonnes, or\n48 pct, and exports by 34,000 tonnes, or 45 pct.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
