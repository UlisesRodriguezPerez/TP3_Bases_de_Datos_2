        "DATELINE": "    MONTREAL, March 3 - ",
        "BODY": "<Royal Bank of Canada> said it\nestimates 1987 loan losses at one billion dlrs, a 25 mln dlr\nincrease over last year.\n    Royal Bank said it set its provisions \"given the continued\ndebt-servicing problems ... in the North American energy\nindustry and the uncertain outlook for energy prices,\" and also\ncontinued to add to its general provisions for loans to\ntroubled borrower countries.\n    The bank's loan loss provision for the first quarter ended\nJanuary 31 rose to 223 mln dlrs from 187 mln dlrs in the\nyear-ago quarter.\n    The bank said non-accrual loans, net of provisions for loan\nlosses, totalled 2.2 billion dlrs on January 31, up from 2.0\nbillion dlrs a year ago.\n    In reporting lower first quarter earnings, chairman Allan\nTaylor said problems with credit quality--particularly in loans\nassociated with the energy sector--continue to have a\nsubstantial adverse effect on the bank's earnings.\n    Taylor said profitability of the bank's international\noperations remains weak, reflecting resource-related\ndifficulties of private and public sector borrowers and\nunsatisfactory results from capital market activities.\n    Taylor said it would be premature to speculate on the\noutcome of debt resturcturing negotiations with Brazil or their\npotential impact on the Royal Bank.\n    The bank earlier reported first quarter profit fell to\n114.1 mln dlrs from 140.4 mln dlrs a year ago.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
