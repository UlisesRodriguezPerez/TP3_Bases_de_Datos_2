        "BODY": "Versatile Corp's shipbuilding subsidiary\nhas a letter of intent to build a 320 mln dlr polar icebreaker\nfor the Canadian coast guard, Transport Minister John Crosbie\nsaid.\n    In a Vancouver address, Crosbie said Versatile Pacific\nShipyards Inc was the low bidder to build the Arctic Class 8\nicebreaker, but the company must meet certain financial and\nengineering conditions before the contract is awarded.\n    The government also announced it will provide up to 13 mln\ndlrs in loan insurance to help Versatile prepare for the\nconstruction of the vessel.\nsaid before the contract can be awarded Versatile \"will be\nrequired to offer assurances that the shipyard is technically\nand financially capable of performing the work.\"\n    Crosibie said Versatile's bid was 100 mln dlrs lower than\ncompeting bidders and will generate 1,000 person years of\ndirect employment.\n    Work on the vessel, which Crosbie said would be the most\npowerful icebreaker in the world, would begin next year and\ncompleted in 1992.\n    The government announced plans to build the icebreaker last\nyear following the controversial passage of the U.S. Coast\nGuard's vessel, the Polar Sea, through the disputed Northwest\nPassage. The U.S. government did not seek permission for the\njourney, claiming the area was an international water way.\n    The government said the icebreaker was needed to back up\nthe country's claim of sovereignty in the Arctic.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
