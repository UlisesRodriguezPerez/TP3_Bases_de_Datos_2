That\nmeeting was called to act on a merger agreement calling for a\nbuyout by BCW Acquisitions Inc.\n    The third identified Becor suitor is <Davis Mining and\nManufacturing Inc>.\n    In Fairfield, N.J., Lynch said its latest proposal calls\nLynch to own 75 pct of Becor's stock and Becor holders to\nretain the other 25 pct.\n    Peviously, Lynch would have held about 25 pct, with Becor\nholders receiving 25 pct and Becor management about half.\n    Lynch said the proposal was changed because it believes\nBecor's management \"needs more guidance in terms of financial\nstructuring.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
