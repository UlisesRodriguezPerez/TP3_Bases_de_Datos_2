        "BODY": "President Reagan called for continued\nnondiscriminatory treatment for Romanian exports to the United\nStates in the face of congressional opposition because of the\nBucharest government's record on human rights.\n    A White House statement said Reagan's decision to press for\ncontinuation of so-called Most Favored Nation (MFN) status for\nRomania had been \"exceptionally difficult\" and came after \"all\noptions were seriously considered.\"\n    But the statement said that despite concerns about human\nrights abuses by the Bucharest government, the president had\ndecided that should be continued because it helped stimulate\nemigration from Romania and gave the United States influence on\nhuman rights practices there.\n    The statement was issued as Reagan sent to Congress\nrequests for one-year extensions of MFN for Romania, Hungary\nand China.\n    The House of Representatives has attached to a trade bill\nlegislation that would temporarily deny MFN for Romania pending\ncertification by Reagan that the country had made progress on\nhuman rights. There is no controversy over continuation of MFN\nfor Hungary and China.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
