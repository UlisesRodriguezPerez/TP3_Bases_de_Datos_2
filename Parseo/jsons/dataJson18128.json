        "BODY": "The Far Eastern sugar market is being hit\nby a tightening in available nearby freight space needed to\nmove raw sugar to various destinations, notably from Thailand,\ntraders said.\n    This has resulted in a hardening of freight rates in those\nareas. These are now being quoted between 12.5 and 17.5 dlrs a\ntonne per day, depending on shipment and destination, against\nrecent fixings below 12 dlrs a tonne.\n    Charterers are considering combining contracted shipments\nbecause of inadequate space, shipping sources said, noting 13\nraws cargoes are awaiting shipment from various ports.\n    A cargo of Thai raw sugar was reported traded at basis July\nNew York futures less 25 points for June/July 15 shipment,\ntraders said. But others said this was old business.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
