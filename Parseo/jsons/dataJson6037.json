        "BODY": "Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel\nLawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to parliament,\nsaid U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar\n1987.\n    He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of\npayments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1\nbillion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct\nat the end of 1987, he said, adding it may exceed 4.5 pct by\nthe summer before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the\nyear.\n    The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was 4.0 billion stg unchanged\nwhen compared with the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87,\nLawson said.\n    Although no explicit target was set for the broad sterling\nM3 money supply, Lawson said broad money will continue to be\ntaken into account in assessing monetary conditions as well as\nthe exchange rate.\n    The low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 was mainly due to\nthe buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the\ncorporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business\nsector in particular.\n    On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier\nassumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per\nbarrel in calendar 1987. The treasury would strive to keep the\nPSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
