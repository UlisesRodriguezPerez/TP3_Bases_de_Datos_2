        "BODY": "Some producers in the 1987 acreage\nreduction program may be eligible for deficiency payments on 92\npct of their enrolled acreage even though none of it is planted\nwith wheat or other program crops, the U.S. Agriculture\nDepartment said.\n    The department said the provision of the Farm Disaster\nAssistance Act will be available to all eligible winter wheat\nproducers, producers of other types of wheat who were prevented\nfrom planting their 1987 wheat crop because of a 1986 natural\ndisaster, and all producers who operate farms with program crop\nacreage bases subject to flooding on 50 pct of such crop's\npermitted acreage.\n    A producer who did not enroll in the 1987 acreage reduction\nprogram may become eligible by signing-up no later than July\n15. Producers will be informed by the local offices when\napplications are being accepted, it said.\n    The department said producers of wheat other than winter\nwheat may use the 0/92 option if they were preventedf from\nplanting their intended acreage with wheat for harvest in 1987\nbecause of any natural disasters which occured in 1986 or if\nthe farm is located in a county approved by Farmers Home\nAdministration for emergency loans for such disasters that\noccurred in 1986.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
