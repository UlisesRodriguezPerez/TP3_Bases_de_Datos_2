        "DATELINE": "    ASHLAND, KY., March 16 - ",
        "BODY": "Ashland Oil Inc said it expects to\nreport a loss from operations in the second quarter.\n    The company also said it expects to report a 10 mln dlrs\nnet gain in the quarter from excess pension funds used to pay\ndown debt. \"However, it is difficult to determine now whether\nthis gain will be sufficient to offset the expected operating\nloss,\" the company said in a statement. A company spokesman\nwould not elaborate.\n    The company's Ashland Petroleum Co unit operated at a loss\nin January and February since it was unable to raise product\nprices enough to recover higher crude oil costs, Ashland said.\n    Although Ashland Petroleum and SuperAmerica, a retail\nmarketing operation, are having a difficult quarter, the\ncompany's Valvoline, Ashland Chemical and coal businesses are\nexpected to report good results for the quarter ended March 31.\n    In the year-ago quarter, Ashland had income from operations\nof 93.8 mln dlrs before corporate and interest expenses, taxes,\nequity income and other items.\n    Net income in the quarter was 39.4 mln dlrs or 1.12 dlrs a\nshare on sales of 1.78 billion dlrs.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
