        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 12 - ",
        "BODY": "The U.S. House Ways and Means Trade\nSubcommittee unanimously approved a toned-down version of\nlegislation designed to toughen U.S. trade laws and wedge open\nforeign markets to more U.S. goods.\n    The measure now goes to the full House Ways and Means\nCommittee next week, but major changes are not expected,\ncongressional sources said.\n    \"This product could very well be toughening our trade policy\nand doing it in a manner that opens markets without this\nfrightening word 'protectionism',\" Ways and Means chairman Dan\nRostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat said.\n    The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specific\nretaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign trade\npractices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year.\n    But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committee\ndebate on a controversial plan by Rep. Richard Gephardt to\nmandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U.S. by\ncountries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.\n    Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, has not decided the exact\nform of his amendment, an aide said. Last year the House\napproved his idea to force an annual 10 pct trade surplus cut\nby those countries.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
