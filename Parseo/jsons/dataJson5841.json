Firms and individuals may only\ninvest in foreign government bonds, treasury bills and\ncertificates of deposit.\n    Central bank and other government officials were not\navailable to comment on the report.\n    Economists said it was likely that the government would\nease foreign exchange controls, but only gradually.\n    They said vast foreign currency reserves, earned mainly\nfrom huge trade surpluses with the United States, made Taiwan a\ntarget for U.S. Protectionism.\n    Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. Rose to 13.6 billion\nU.S. Dlrs last year compared with 10.2 billion in 1985.\n    \"The central bank has to go in this direction,\" said Su\nHan-min, chief economist with the International Commercial Bank\nof China. \"If they don't quicken the pace, Washington could\nretaliate and really damage Taiwan.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003"
