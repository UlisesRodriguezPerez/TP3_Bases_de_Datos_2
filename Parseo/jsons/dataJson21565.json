        "BODY": "New Zealand has imposed sanctions\nagainst Fiji in response to that country's change of status to\na republic, acting prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said.\n    The sanctions will end all military cooperation and cut\neconomic aid. New Zealand will also not renew an agreement\nwhich supports the price of Fijian sugar when it expires in\nMarch. The loss of aid and sugar supports will cost Fiji about\n10 mln dlrs a year.\n    Palmer told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the\ngovernment had asked High Commissioner Rod Gates to return from\nSuva for discussions about other possible measures.\n    \"We won't be reacting further until these discussions with\nthe High Commissioner and the Prime Minister have been held,\"\nPalmer said.\n    The sanctions were approved by the cabinet soon after\nColonel Sitivene Rabuka staged his second coup on September 25.\nImplementation was postponed in the hope that Rabuka might turn\nback from declaring a republic.\n    Palmer said the cabinet was happy with the statement from\nCommonwealth leaders in Vancouver that Fiji's membership of the\nCommonwealth had lapsed. Prime Minister David Lange is in\nHawaii on his way home from Vancouver.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
