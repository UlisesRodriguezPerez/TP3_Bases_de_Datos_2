        "BODY": "A plan by European producers to sell\n854,000 tonnes of sugar to European Community intervention\nstocks still stands, Andrea Minguzzi, an official at French\nsugar producer Beghin-Say, said.\n    Last week Beghin-Say president Jean-Marc Vernes said a\npossible settlement of a row with the EC would lead producers\nto withdraw their offer, which was made as a protest against EC\nexport licensing policies.\n    The EC policy is to offer export rebates, which fail to\ngive producers an equivalent price to that which they would get\nby offering sugar into intervention stocks, Vernes said.\n    But Minguzzi said the offer was a commercial affair and\nthat producers had no intention of withdrawing the sugar offer\nalready lodged with intervention boards of different European\ncountries. He said final quality approval for all the sugar\noffered could come later this week. Some 95 pct had already\ncleared quality specifications.\n    The EC can only reject an offer to sell into intervention\nstocks on quality grounds. Minguzzi added that under EC\nregulations, the Community has until early May to pay for the\nsugar. He declined to put an exact figure on the amount of\nsugar offered by Beghin-Say, but said it was below 500,000\ntonnes.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
