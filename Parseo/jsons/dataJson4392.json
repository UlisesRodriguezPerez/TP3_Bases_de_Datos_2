I\ndon't think the world price is lower than our price anyway.\"\n    However, the USDA secretary said that if current conditions\nof surplus production persisted, it might be appropriate to\nconsider a marketing loan.\n    \"I suppose that under that condition there is a danger our\nexports will continue to drop and that the government will\ncontinue to accumulate large stocks of soybeans,\" he said. \"It\nmight be (worth contemplating a marketing loan), if there were\na world market that was lower than our market.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
