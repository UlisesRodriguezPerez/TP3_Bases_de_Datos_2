        "BODY": "OPEC believes world oil prices should\nbe set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPEC\nAssistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said.\n    In a speech to a European Community/OAPEC/OPEC seminar in\nLuxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said, \"OPEC believes ...the\nworld energy trade should be kept without restrictions and\nshould be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs.\"\n    Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the\norganization's agreed ceiling for all member countries in\nFebruary, although this had meant sacrifices. The effect of\nthese sacrifices meant that market stability, though restored\nto a good level, was still under pressure, Al-Wattari said.\n    \"A lasting stability in the world market requires a wider\nscope of international cooperation,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
