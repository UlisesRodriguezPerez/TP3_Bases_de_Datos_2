        "BODY": "About 14,000 of Brazil's 40,000\nseamen are now back at work after pay accords with 21 shipping\ncompanies but the rest are still on strike, a spokesman at\nstrike headquarters said today.\n    The seamen began a national stoppage on February 27.\n    The spokesman, talking by telephone from Rio de Janeiro,\nsaid 126 ships were strike-bound.\n    He added that because of resignations by many seamen there\nwere scarcely any crews left on 38 of these ships.\n    The seamen have settled in general for pay rises of 120 pct\nwith the 21 companies. Talks with the shipowners' association\nSyndarma have been deadlocked over overtime.\n    While exports have been delayed by the strike, exporters\nsay the problems have been manageable.\n    \"It hasn't been critical by any means,\" said a coffee trader\nin Santos, who noted that coffee was still moving on foreign\nships.\n    Economic analysts added, however, that any delay to exports\nserved to aggravate Brazil's balance of payments crisis, which\nlast month prompted the government to suspend interest payments\non 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
