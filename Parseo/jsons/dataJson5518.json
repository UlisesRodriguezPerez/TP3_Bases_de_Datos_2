        "BODY": "U.S. Trade Representative Clayton\nYeutter suggested the U.S. could file a formal complaint with\nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) challenging\nCanada's decision to impose duties on U.S. corn imports.\n    Asked about the Canadian government decision to apply a\nduty of 84.9 cents per bushel on U.S. corn shipments, Yeutter\nsaid the U.S. could file a formal complaint with GATT under the\ndispute settlement procedures of the subsidies code.\n    Other U.S. options would be to appeal the decision in\nCanadian courts, or to retaliate against Canadian goods, a\nlower-level U.S. trade official said. However, retaliation is\nan unlikely step, at least initially, that official said. No\ndecision on U.S. action is expected at least until after\ndocuments on the ruling are received here later this week.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
