        "BODY": "U.S. Trade Representative Clayton\nYeutter said it was all but certain President Reagan would go\nahead today and impose curbs on Japanese exports as planned.\n    Asked in a television interview what the chance was for\nReagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japanese\nelectronic exports, he said \"slim to none.\"\n    Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs to\nretaliate for Japan's failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end\ndumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than\ncost and to open its home markets to U.S. products.\n    Yeutter, on the NBC program \"Today,\" said the United States\ndid not want to terminate the agreement and would drop\nthe tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement.\n    He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officials\nthey were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would take\ntime to monitor any compliance.\n    Asked how long that would take, he said \"We want to see a\npattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that would\ntake a few weeks.\"\n    Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer\nimpact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods\nbecause the items selected are also readily available from\nother countries and manufacturers.\n    He said he did not think Japan would retaliate.\n    \"It seems to me it is not in the interests of either country\nto get in an escalating conflict.  The Japanese understand that\nfull well,\" Yeutter said.\n    He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but \"that's more of a\npaper kind of exercise and I don't really expect to see any\nadverse impact on U.S. trade.\"\n    Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor\nissue could be resolved before or during a Washington visit\nlater this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.\n    He said he hoped the visit, which is to have trade as a\nmajor issue, would be productive but \"I don't see any practical\nway to resolve this particular dispute before or during his\nvisit.\"\n reuter\n\u0003"
