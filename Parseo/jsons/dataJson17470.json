        "DATELINE": "    KUWAIT, June 1 - ",
        "BODY": "The Kuwait Central Bank kept its window\nfor funds to the domestic interbank deposit market shut as\nbanks returned from a four day holiday, dealers said.\n    The move drove short-term interest rates sharply higher,\nwith overnight and tomorrow-next funds more than doubling from\nlast Wednesday and hitting 20 pct.\n    There were few offers in a tight market and traders\nscrambled for any available funds. One-month to one-year\ndeposits were indicated one point higher at eight, seven pct\nbut there was little activity at the longer end of the market.\n    Bankers see the suspension of central bank aid as a\ndeliberate move to drive up Kuwaiti dinar interest rates and\nstem a flow of funds out of the country, where market\nnervousness is increasing over the growing tension in the Gulf.\n    The central bank's move has been combined with a steady cut\nin the dinar exchange rate.\n    Today's rate was reduced to 0.27939/73 to the dollar from\n0.27758/92 on Wednesday before the four day bank holiday that\ncelebrated the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
