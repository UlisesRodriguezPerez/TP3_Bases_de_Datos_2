        "BODY": "Continental Corp said the fresh start\nprovision of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 may add 1.30 to 1.60 to\n1987 earnings per share.\n    The insurance holding company had net earnings of 449.6 mln\ndlrs, or, or 7.42 per share, in 1986.\n    John Loynes, Continental chief financial officer, said the\nfresh start provision allowed the company to discount opening\ntax reserves to January 1, 1987, which released deferred taxes\ninto earnings.\n    Loynes said the provision's potential benefit would decline\ngradually over the next four years, during which time\nContinental will pay 250 mln to 350 mln dlrs more in taxes.\n    Loynes added, however, the higher taxes are not expecetd to\nhave a significant impact on earnings.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
