        "BODY": "Nova, an Alberta Corp, chief executive\nRobert Blair expressed hope that Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP>\nremains under Canadian ownership, but added that his company\nplans no bid of its own for debt-troubled Dome.\n    \"We've no plan to bid,\" Blair told reporters after a speech\nto a business group, although he stressed that Nova and 57\npct-owned Husky Oil Ltd <HYO> were interested in Dome's\nextensive Western Canadian energy holdings.\n    \"But being interested can sometimes be different from\nmaking a bid,\" Blair said.\n    TransCanada PipeLines Ltd <TRP> yesterday bid 4.30 billion\ndlrs for Dome, but Dome said it was discontinuing talks with\nTransCanada and was considering a proposal from another company\nand was also talking with another possible buyer, both rumored\nto be offshore.\n    Asked by reporters if Dome should remain in Canadian hands,\nBlair replied, \"Yes. I think that we still need to be building\nas much Canadian position in this industry as we can and I\nthink it would be best if Dome ends up in the hands of Canadian\nmanagement.\"\n    He said he did not know who other possible bidders were.\n    Blair said that any move to put Dome's financial house in\norder \"will remove one of the general problems of attitude that\nhave hung over Western Canadian industry.\"\n    He added, however, that the energy industry still faced \"a\ncouple of tough, tough additional years.\"\n    Asked about Nova's 1987 prospects, Blair predicted that\nNova's net profit would rise this year to more than 150 mln\ndlrs from last year's net profit of 100.2 mln dlrs due to\nimproved product prices and continued cost-cutting.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
