        "BODY": "Gold rose by about 50 U.S. Cents an\nounce, following a statement by President Ronald Reagan that\nthe arms-for-hostages deal with Iran \"was a mistake,\" dealers\nsaid.\n    Bullion rose to 409.40/90 dlrs from an initial low of\n408.90/409.40. This compares with the opening of 409.00/50 and\nNew York's close of 410.00/50.\n    Dealers noted mild short-covering in the metal after some\ninitial selling by local investors. Trading was fairly quiet\nthis morning partly owed to the slow U.S. Dollar activities,\nthey added.\n    However, Reagan's remarks had only a short-lived bullish\nimpact on the gold price, which is now stabilising at 409.10/60\ndlrs, dealers said.\n    On the local market, the metal traded in a narrow range of\n3,800 and 3,805 H.K. Dlrs a tael against yesterday's 3,778\nclose.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
