        "BODY": "Japan's economy remains sluggish but is\nbeginning to show signs it may bottom out soon, the Economic\nPlanning Agency said in a monthly report submitted to Cabinet\nministers.\n    But a bottoming out of the economy depends largely on the\nyen's exchange rate trend in the immediate future, Agency\nofficials said.\n    The officials told reporters industrial production, down\n0.5 pct in January from December, is likely to turn positive in\nFebruary and to rise thereafter, raising hopes for a brighter\neconomic outlook.\n    The Agency predicted industrial production will grow 2.5\npct in the current January/March quarter after falling 0.7 pct\nin the previous quarter.\n    A rise of this size would be the largest since the fourth\nquarter of 1984 when industrial output rose 2.7 pct, the\nofficials said.\n    They also said an expected upturn in exports would be a\nmixed blessing as it would contribute to economic growth but\nwould increase the chance of trade friction.\n    Japanese exports contracted five pct in February from\nJanuary but are likely to grow from March if the yen stabilizes\naround current levels, the officials said.\n    They predicted exports will increase by 2.3 pct in the\nJanuary/March quarter from the October/December quarter.\n    \"But the problem is imports are not expanding,\" said one\nofficial. Imports fell by 9.4 pct in February from January.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
