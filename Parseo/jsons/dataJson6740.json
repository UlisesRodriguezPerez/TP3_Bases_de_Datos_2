        "BODY": "New England Electric System's auditors\nhave again qualified the utility's annual report because of\nuncertainty about whether its oil and gas subsidiary can\nrecover its investments.\n    The qualification was noted in the annual report which New\nEngland Electric released at a security analysts meeting today.\nThe auditors also qualified the company's 1985 report for the\nsame reason, noting the sharp drop in oil and gas prices in\nearly 1986.\n    President Samuel Huntington told analysts the utility will\nhave to take a write-down of about 235 mln dlrs if Federal\nregulators do not allow the company to pass on the losses cited\nby the accountants to its rate payers.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
