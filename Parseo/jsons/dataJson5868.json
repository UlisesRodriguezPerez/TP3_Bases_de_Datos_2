        "BODY": "<Billiton\nInternational Metals B.V.>, the Dutch mining company, has urged\nSurinam to change policies it says are causing heavy losses on\nbauxite mining operations there, a company spokesman said.\n    He told Reuters that Billiton, a fully-owned Royal\nDutch/Shell <RD.AS> subsidiary, presented the demands to Henk\nHeidweiler, a top aide to Surinam military leader Desi\nBouterse, who visited the Netherlands last week for official\ntalks.\n    Billiton and <Suralco>, owned by U.S. Conglomerate Alcoa\n<AA.S>, both want devaluation, and lower wages, welfare\ncontributions, taxes on bauxite and energy prices.\n    The two firms are the biggest private sector employers in\nSurinam. Billiton also urged Heidweiler to improve the safety\nof its employees in the campaign against a jungle guerilla\ngroup, the spokesman said, adding rebel fighting since July\n1986 had depressed production at Billiton and Suralco plants.\n    High voltage cables from the power plant of Afobakka have\nbeen cut, and a bauxite mine at Moengo has been shut, he added.\n    \"We are already making vast losses in Surinam and you can't\nexpect any company to remain operating with losses,\" the\nspokesman said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
