        "BODY": "Hundreds of marines were on alert\nat 11 key Brazilian ports after 40,000 seamen decided to remain\non indefinite strike, even after the Higher Labour Court\nSaturday ruled it illegal, union leaders said.\n    The halt, the first national strike by seamen in 25 years,\nstarted on February 27, and union leaders said they would not\nreturn to work unless they got a 275 pct pay rise. Shipowners\nhave offered a 100 per cent raise, which the seamen rejected.\n    \"We have nothing to lose. If they want to lay off the\nworkers, fine, but we are determined to carry on with our\nprotest until the end,\" a union leader said.\n more\n    He said they had decided in a meeting that if the marines\ntake over the ships, the seamen would abandon the vessels and\nlet the marines handle the situation by themselves.\n    A spokesman for the Rio de Janeiro Port said the order to\nsend marines to take over the ports was given by Navy Minister\nHenrique Saboya on grounds that ports are areas of national\nsecurity. But he said there were no incidents. The strike has\ncut exports and imports and made an estimated 160 ships idle.\n    Petrol station owners in four states also continued their\nshutdown and there were fears that the combination of the two\nstoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
