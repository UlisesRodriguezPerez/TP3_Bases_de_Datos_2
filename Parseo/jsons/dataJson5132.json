        "BODY": "The Commerce Department said all\nCanadian firms have begun to pay an agreed 15 pct surcharge on\nsoftwood shipped to U.S. markets.\n    It made the statement after talks with Canadian officials\nabout rumors in Canada that some exporters were not paying the\ncharge.\n    Canada and the U.S. agreed last December to the 15 pct\ncharge, ending a lengthy trade dispute over alleged Canadian\nsubsidies to Canada's softwood exporters.\n    Commerce officials declined to say if any Canadian\ncompanies had been evading the charge, but said following the\ntalks they were convinced all exporters were complying with the\nagreement.\n    Undersecretary of Commerce Bruce Smart said \"We are\ngratified to learn that companies in Canada have begun paying\nthe export charge on lumber.\"\n    He added the agreement was important to the health of the\nU.S. lumber industry and he intended to see that it was fully\ncarried out.\n reuter\n\u0003"
