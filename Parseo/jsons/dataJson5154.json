        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, March 15 - ",
        "BODY": "Iran has deployed about six large\nmissiles near the Strait of Hormuz which increase the threat to\nshipping in the Gulf, the New York Times said.\n    The paper quoted U.S. Intelligence sources as saying the\nmissiles appeared to be of a Chinese design known as HY-2 which\nis based on the Soviet SSN2 or Styx missile.\n    Styx missiles have a range of up to 50 miles.\n    It said the missiles had been deployed at two sites and\nquoted a naval analyst as saying they could be used to sink a\nsupertanker and block the Strait of Hormuz.\n    Missiles now used by Iran had only a fraction of the\nexplosive power of the Styx and could sink a supertanker only\nwith a lucky hit, the paper said. None of the new missiles had\nbeen fired yet, it added.\n    The CBS television network reported on Friday that Iran had\ninstalled new missiles along the Gulf and said Washington had\nwarned Tehran not to use them against civilian shipping.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
