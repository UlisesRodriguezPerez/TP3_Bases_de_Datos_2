        "BODY": "Rising water levels on the Rhine caused by\nheavy rain are delaying an operation near Karlsruhe to raise\ntwo sunken boats which have blocked the river's main navigation\nchannel since early last week, a Karlsruhe water authority\nspokesman said.\n    He said two floating cranes were unable to begin lifting\nthe sunken tug Orinoko and its lighter because the water level\nhad reached 815 centimetres and was forecast to rise to 820-830\ncm by tomorrow. He was unable to say when the operation might\nbegin.\n    Meanwhile, high water at Cologne has forced vessels to\ntravel at reduced speed, a water authority spokesman in Cologne\nsaid. But a water authority spokesman in Duisburg, 60 kms north\nof Cologne, said vessels there were moving normally.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
