        "BODY": "The Jordan branch of Iraq's Rafidain Bank\nsaid it will raise paid-up capital to comply with the country's\nminimum requirement of five mln dinars by drawing on profits\nfrom its operations in the country.\n    Jordan's government asked banks in early 1985 to comply\nwith the new capital requirement -- raised from three mln\ndinars -- by the start of 1986.\n    Rafidain's Area Manager Adnan Abdul Karim al-Azzawi told\nReuters the branch had now registered its capital at the higher\nlevel but did not say how long it would take to pay it in. The\nbank's 1986 balance shows paid-up capital of 3.1 mln dinars.\n    Banks in Jordan have generally complied with the higher\ncapital requirement except Chase Manhattan which decided\ninstead to close its operation, banking sources said.\n    Local banks floated shares to raise extra capital, while\nthe branches of foreign banks brought in additional cash.\n    Banking sources said it appeared that Jordan had made an\nexception in Rafidain's case, allowing it longer to comply.\nThey said the gesture refelcted close political ties between\nJordan and Iraq as well as Baghdad's financial difficulties.\n    The Jordan branch saw pre-tax profit rise 80 pct in 1986 to\n550,332 dinars on assets of 12.6 mln dinars.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
