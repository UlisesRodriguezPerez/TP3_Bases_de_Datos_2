        "BODY": "The Philippine 1987 inflation rate will\nrise to 4.8 pct from 0.74 pct in 1986 if the government\nimplements an employers' association recommendation for a 10\npct increase in the 54 peso minimum daily wage this month,\nEconomic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod said.\n    The government's own proposal for an across-the-board daily\npay rise of six pesos for non-agricultural workers and eight\npesos for agriculture workers, would push the full year average\nhigher to 5.4 pct, she told the Senate last week.\n    The 10 pct rise in the minimum wage is recommended by the\nEmployers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP).\n    The ECOP proposal would push the year-on-year inflation\nrate to 11.6 pct in December compared with the predicted 14.4\npct if the government's recommendation is implemented, Solita\nsaid. Both were proposed last month.\n    Annual inflation for 1987 was forecast at four to 4.5 pct\nby the National Economic and Development Authority early this\nmonth.\n    In the first three months of the year, inflation was a\nnegative 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 pct respectively, rising to 1.0, 2.5\nand 4.6 pct in April May and June, the National Statistics\nOffice said.\n    The annual inflation rate rose to 5.8 pct in June, 6.2 pct\nin July and 6.15 and 6.188 pct in August and September\nrespectively, the National Statistics Office said.\n    It attributed the acceleration to higher fuel and water\nprices.\n    The government's six and eight peso wage increases would\ndisplace up to 20,000 workers, Monsod said, bringing the number\nof unemployed to 4.2 mln or 19.2 pct of the population.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
