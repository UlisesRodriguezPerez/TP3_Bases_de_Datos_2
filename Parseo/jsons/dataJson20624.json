        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - ",
        "BODY": "Confronted by new hostilities\ninvolving U.S. forces in the Gulf, the U.S. Senate voted to end\nRepublican stalling tactics and limit debate on a measure that\ncould give Congress a larger role in Gulf policy.\n    The measure, however, does not require President Reagan to\ncomply with the 1973 War Powers Act as does a related Senate\nbill. The controversial War Powers Act could require a pullout\nof U.S. forces from the Gulf.\n    The Senate voted 67-28 to stop a filibuster and limit\ndebate to 30 hours on a bipartisan measure that requires Reagan\nto report to Congress on Gulf policy within 60 days and calls\nfor a resolution to be passed in the House and Senate on the\nsituation in the volatile waterway 30 days later.\n    The resolution could be about any Gulf-related issue,\nincluding an expression of support or of disapproval for\nReagan's policy of protecting 11 Kuwaiti tankers from Iran in\nthe waterway. The Pentagon said the 12th U.S.-protected convoy\nbegan moving through the Gulf early Tuesday.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
