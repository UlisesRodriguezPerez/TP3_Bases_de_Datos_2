        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, April 7 - ",
        "BODY": "Allegheny International Inc, which has\nagreed to a merge with a jointly-formed First Boston Inc\naffiliate in a deal worth 500 mn dlrs, said shareholders of its\npreferred stock have filed a class action complaint against the\ncompany.\n    The complaint alleges, among other things, that the company\nand its board agreed to pay First Boston an illegal seven mln\ndlr topping fee if it received a higher offer for the company\nprior to the buyout.\n    The suit contends that this fee hampers Allegheny's ability\nto attract other offers or take other actions that would\nbenefit holders of preferred stock. The complaint also alleges\nfederal securities laws violations and breach of fiduciary\nduty.\n    The suit requests an injunction against proceeding with the\npending offer being made by Sunter Acquisition to acquire\nAllegheny. Sunter Acquisition Corp and Sunter Holdings Corp\nwere formed by First Boston and Allegheny.\n    Allegheny said it and the Sunter concerns intend to\nvigorously defend the complaint's charges.\n    The complaints were filed by Robert Moss and other parties\nwho are believed to own about 230,000 shares of Allegheny's\npreferred stock.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
