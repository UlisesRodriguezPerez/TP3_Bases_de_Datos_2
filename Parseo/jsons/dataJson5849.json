        "BODY": "Zimbabwe's real gross domestic product\nincreased 0.2 pct in 1986, according to preliminary figures\npublished by the Central Statistical Office (CSO). This\ncontrasts with a rise of more than nine pct in 1985.\n    The main reason for the slower rate of economic growth was\na drop in the real value of agricultural output. This declined\n12 pct in 1986 following a 24 pct improvement the previous\nyear. Mining output fell one pct in 1986 but manufacturing\nproduction increased 1.4 pct.\n    The CSO said that at current prices GDP rose 12.7 pct to\n8.2 billion Zimbabwe dlrs, but inflation, measured by the GDP\ndeflator, was estimated at 12.2 pct, so there was virtually no\ngrowth in real output during 1986.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
