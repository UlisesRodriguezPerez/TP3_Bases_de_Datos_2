        "BODY": "Venezuelan Central Bank President Hernan\nAnzola has submitted his resignation and asked President Jaime\nLusinchi to transfer him to a post in the oil industry, two\nleading Venezuelan newspapers reported.\n    The El Universal and El Nacional papers said Anzola would\nleave his position soon. Lusinchi already has decided on his\nsuccessor, the El Nacional reported.\n    Central Bank officials were not available for comment.\n\n    Banking sources said Anzola differed with the Finance\nMinistry over economic policy, particularly over the direction\nof interest rates. He favoured raising the rates, which are\ncurrently well below the annual inflation rate of 33.2 pct.\n    But the sources said he ran into opposition from Finance\nMinistry and government officials who thought an interest\nincrease would fuel inflation.\n\n REUTER\n\u0003"
