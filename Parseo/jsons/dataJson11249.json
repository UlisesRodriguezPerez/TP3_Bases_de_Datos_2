        "BODY": "<British Caledonian Group>, Britain's\nsecond largest airline, has announced a 19.3 mln stg pretax\nloss for the financial year ending last October, compared with\na record pre-tax profit of 21.7 mln stg in 1985, chairman Sir\nAdam Thomson told reporters.\n    A decline in U.S. Transatlantic traffic following terrorist\nattacks in Europe, the U.S. Bombing of the Libya, the Chernobyl\ndisaster and a slump in the oil industry which affected Middle\nEast traffic were the main causes of the loss, Thomson said.\n    He said the poor results were caused by \"a range of\nexceptional circumstances wholly outside our direct control\" and\npredicted a return to profitability this year.\n    Last year, the airline was forced to axe 1,000 jobs, sell\nsome of its assets and cut the number of its flights across the\nAtlantic and to the Middle East following the fall in business\n.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
