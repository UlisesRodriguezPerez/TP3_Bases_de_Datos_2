        "BODY": "Over 750,000 head of cattle are suffering\nthe effects of a severe shortage of feed as a result of a\nprolonged drought in the normally rich sugar and cattle\nproducing province of Camaguey, the newspaper Granma reported.\n    The province produces 23 pct of Cuba's beef and is the\nisland's number two province in milk production. Granma said\n20,000 head of cattle are now in imminent danger.\n    The newspaper said a \"cattle emergency\" had been decreed and\nthe cattle are being rounded up.\n    Some 110,000 head have been transferred to the sugar cane\nconditioning centers where newly harvested cane is cleaned\nbefore being sent to the mills. The cattle are being fed the\nresidue left after cleaning the cane stalks. 32,000 head have\nbeen sent to nearby provinces of Las Tunas and Ciego de Avila.\n    Despite Cuba's ambitous cattle development plans, beef\nrationing has been in effect over the past 25 years. In Havana,\neach Cuban receives approximately 3/4 lb of rationed beef every\n18 days.\n    In a major area hit by drought, San Miguel, practically no\nrain has fallen in the past 14 months. Grazing lands are\nparched and the region was unable to produce 117,000 tonnes of\nsilage projected in its annual plan.\n    Granma said rainfall over the past year has been less than\n50 pct of normal precipitation.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
