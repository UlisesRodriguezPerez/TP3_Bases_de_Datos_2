Last month it\nsaid the Bank of England took the opportunity of strong demand\nto rebuild reserves after losses last autumn.\n    Actual reserves rose by 1.89 billion dlrs, after rising 305\nmln in February, to 22.26 billion. Total reserves were revalued\nto 27.04 billion dlrs, but would have totalled 24.15 billion\nunder the previous valuation, the Treasury said. Gold reserves\nwere revalued by 895 mln dlrs, while SDRs, ECU and convertible\ncurrency holdings were revalued by 1.995 billion.\n    Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were\n361 mln dlrs last month, after 36 mln in February.
