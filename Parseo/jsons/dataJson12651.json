        "BODY": "Noranda Inc said production at its\nMurdochville, Quebec copper mine was shut down by the fire that\nbroke out last night, trapping 44 miners and killing one.\n    Noranda spokesman Denis Morin said it was impossible to\njudge how long the shutdown might last but said he thought it\ncould be at least one week.\n    The mine produced 1,792,000 tonnes of ore in 1986, Morin\nsaid. It has a mineral inventory of 35,065,000 tonnes.\n    In the mine's three zones last year, copper grade was 1.10\npct at Needle Mountain, 0.30 pct at Copper Mountain Oxide and\n1.32 pct at Murdochville, Morin said.\n    Another Noranda spokesman said the smelter at Murdochville,\nwhich has not been shut down, has the capacity to treat 218,000\ntonnes of mineral concentrate per year.\n    The smelter treats ore from other mines as well as product\nfrom the Murdochville facility, he said.\n    The fire broke out last night in the mine which is situated\nin the Gaspe district of eastern Quebec.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
