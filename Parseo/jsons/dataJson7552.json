        "BODY": "Copper shipments are likely to be\ndelayed because of power problems at <Philippine Associated\nSmelting and Refining Corp> (PASAR), the country's only\nsmelter, a company official said.\n    Asked to confirm reports by New York copper trade sources\nabout PASAR's shipment problems, marketing manager Deogracias\nMadrid told Reuters, \"They are partly correct. There could be a\nprobable delay.\"\n    Madrid declined to give more details, or production and\nexport figures, saying the information could lead to\nspeculation.\n    PASAR's smelter is in the central province of Leyte.\n    The New York trade sources said if PASAR's shipments were\ndelayed, customers might have to turn to the London Metal\nExchange for supply.\n    \"We have a commitment to our customers and I would not like\nto comment on that,\" Madrid said.\n    A spokeswoman for the Chamber of Mines said Philippine\ncopper production amounted to 222,644 tonnes in 1986, down\nslightly from 226,157 tonnes in 1985. She said production in\nthe first two months of 1987 totalled 34,550 tonnes, compared\nwith 36,462 tonnes in the same 1986 period.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
