        "BODY": "The Bank of France said it cut its money\nmarket intervention rate to 7-3/4 pct from eight pct when it\ninjected money against first category paper.\n    The bank also cut its seven-day repossession rate to 8-1/2\npct from 8-3/4 pct.\n    The intervention rate has stood at eight pct since it was\nraised from 7-1/4 pct on January 2 as the French franc came\nunder pressure ahead of the EMS realignment on January 11.\n    The bank said the purchase, effective tomorrow, is for five\npct of private paper and fixed rate Treasury bills maturing\nbetween March 25 and June 25 and of other Treasury bills\nmaturing between March 25, 1987 and March 25, 1989.\n    The rate cut had been expected since the bank announced a\nmoney market intervention tender earlier today.\n    Money market dealers said conditions seemed right for a\nquarter percentage point cut, reflecting an easing in the call\nmoney rate last week, and the French franc's steadiness on\nforeign exchange markets since the February 22 currency\nstabilisation accord here by the Group of Five and Canada.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
