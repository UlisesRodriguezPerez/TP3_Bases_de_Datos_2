        "BODY": "Discussions on the possible extension of\nthe sixth International Tin Agreement (ITA) began at the\nquarterly session of the International Tin Council (ITC) but\nthe Council is still waiting for decisions from various member\nstates.\n    A number of producer governments in particular have not\ndecided their final position on whether the ITA should be\nextended for up to two years or wound down after it expires on\nJune 30, according to delegate sources.\n    Earlier today European Community (EC) members decided to\nback an extension, with the exception of Britain, which\nundertook to communicate its decision to its EC partners later.\n    Delegates said it could be Friday before all the member\ncountries declare their positions on the possible extension.\nToday's full Council session started shortly before 1500 GMT\nafter the scheduled 1330 start was delayed by an EC\ncoordination meeting.\n    The council reconvenes at 0930 GMT tomorrow, although\ndelegates said the morning is likely to be taken up with minor\ntechnical matters and the main issue will probably not be\ndiscussed before the afternoon session.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
