        "BODY": "A top U.S. Official said Japan has little\nchance of convincing the U.S. To drop threatened trade\nsanctions, despite the efforts of a Japanese team that left for\nWashington today.\n    Michael Armacost, Under Secretary of State for Political\nAffairs, was asked at a press conference whether Japan's moves\nto boost its domestic economy and open its markets could\npersuade the U.S. Not to impose tariffs on Japanese imports\nsaid, and replied: \"...It is probably too early for the figures\nto demonstrate that the situation has turned around and to\npermit the result you have described.\"\n    Armacost said the U.S. Hopes Japan will take steps to lift\nits domestic economy and reduce dependence on exports, remove\nbarriers to imports and settle outstanding trade issues.\n    \"There are obvious problems at the moment in the trade area,\nbut we do not wish those problems to divert attention from\nimportant areas of cooperation that continue to exist on\nsecurity and political issues,\" he said.\n    \"The question is whether through cooperative actions between\nour governments we can reduce the (trade) imbalance or whether\nCongress takes action to reduce it through protectionist\nlegislation,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
