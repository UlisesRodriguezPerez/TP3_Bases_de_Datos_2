        "BODY": "West German industrial production,\nseasonally adjusted, rose a provisional 3.2 pct in February\nafter a downwards revised decline of 3.4 pct in January, the\nEconomics Ministry said.\n    The ministry had originally estimated that industrial\nproduction fell 3.0 pct in January.\n    The February figure is likely to be revised upwards by just\nunder one percentage point next month when the March figure is\nreleased, a ministry statement said.\n    The industrial production index, base 1980, stood at a\nprovisional 104.1 in February against 100.9 in January and\n104.5 in December. The ministry had previously put the January\nand December indices at 101.6 and 104.7 respectively.\n    In February 1986 the output index had stood at 103.7,\nproducing a year-on-year rise for February 1987 of 0.4 pct.\n    The February rise in production was aided by a sharp 19 pct\nincrease in construction output compared with January, when\nproduction in many industrial sectors was depressed by\nunusually severe winter weather.\n    Manufacturing industry registered a 3-1/2 pct rise in\nproduction in February compared with January. But energy sector\noutput fell nine pct and mining production declined seven pct.\n    The ministry, which considers two-monthly comparisons to be\na better guide to trends, said output in January and February\ntogether fell around two pct against November and December.\n    The ministry said construction output fell 13-1/2 pct in\nJanuary/February against November/December due to the cold\nJanuary weather. Output in the energy sector rose four pct and\nmining output 10 pct.\n    Manufacturing industry's production fell 1-1/2 pct in\nJanuary/February compared with November/December.\n    Within this sector, the output of both basic products and\nof food, tobacco and alcohol fell 1-1/2 pct. Production of\ncapital goods fell 2-1/2 pct while output of consumer goods was\nunchanged.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
