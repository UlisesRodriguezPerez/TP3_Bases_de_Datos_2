        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 5 - ",
        "BODY": "MCI Communications Corp President\nBert Roberts said he expects MCI's financial performance to\nimprove in the current quarter compared to the previous\nquarter.\n    He said American Telephone and Telegraph Co long-distance\nrate cuts had cut into MCI's fourth quarter performance but\nadded: \"There's going to be a continuing impact (on profits) but\nwe expect this quarter to be better than the fourth quarter.\"\n    The current quarter ends March 31.\n    For the fourth quarter, MCI reported a 448 mln dlr loss,\ndue mainly to write-offs and staff reductions.\n    Roberts said the ATT long-distance rate reductions, which\nhad been ordered by the Federal Communications Commission have\nhad \"A significantly negative impact on our profits.\"\n    As reported earlier today, MCI said it plans to ask the FCC\nto immediately deregulate ATT, apparently in hopes that an\nunregulated ATT would pocket a greater proportion of its\nrevenues rather than cut rates further.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
