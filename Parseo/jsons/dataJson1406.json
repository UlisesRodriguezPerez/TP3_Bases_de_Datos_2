        "BODY": "The Senate Agriculture Committee is\nexpected to take up a bill tomorrow that would exempt from\ngovernment conservation regulations those farmers who have\nrotated alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes with\nrow crops, committee staff said.\n    Under current so-called \"sodbuster\" law, farmers who planted\nalfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes on highly\nerodible land in the years 1981 through 1985 lose federal farm\nprogram benefits if they produce a row crop on that land in\nlater years.\n    Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Neb.), sponsor of the measure, said\nrecently that those crop rotating practices resulted in less\nerosion than the practices of many farmers who produced\nstrictly row crops.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
