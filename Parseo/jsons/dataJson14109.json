        "TITLE": "GERMAN LONG-TERM CAPITAL INFLOW SLUMPS IN FEBRUARY",
        "DATELINE": "    FRANKFURT, April 7 - ",
        "BODY": "The inflow of long-term capital into\nWest Germany slumped to 606 mln marks in February from\nJanuary's record 11.91 billion, with foreign purchases of\nGerman bonds and shares declining sharply, the Bundesbank said.\n    While foreigners bought only four billion marks worth of\nGerman bonds in February after 13 billion in January, they sold\na net 500 mln marks in shares and promissory notes of public\nauthorities after sales worth 300 mln in January.\n    With German investors' purchases of foreign securities\nsteady around 1.3 billion marks, only 2.2 billion marks were\nimported through securities transactions, after 11.2 billion.\n    Direct investment abroad led to a capital outflow of 1.60\nbillion marks in February after 2.83 billion in January.\n    There was a deficit of 8.14 billion marks in the short-term\ncapital account after a surplus of 194 mln in January.\n    Banks alone exported some 8.6 billion marks in funds while\ndomestic companies increased their short-term financial assets\nabroad by 700 mln. But public authorities received some one\nbillion marks from abroad, the Bundesbank said in a statement.\n    Combining long and short term capital outflows, West\nGermany recorded a net outflow of 7.53 billion marks in\nFebruary against a net inflow of 11.91 billion in January.\n    The Bundesbank confirmed the German trade surplus widened\nto 10.45 billion marks in February from January's 7.20 billion.\n    Taking the two months together the seasonally adjusted\nsurplus was slightly below the figure for the previous two. In\nterms of current as well as constant prices, the narrowing of\nthe surplus was progressing, the bank said.\n    Germany's current account surplus widened to 6.63 billion\nmarks in February from 4.79 billion in January, but was down on\nthe 7.26 billion figure for February 1986. Seasonally adjusted,\nthe February current account surplus narrowed against January.\n    While exports in February fell a half pct against the same\nmonth last year, imports fell 10-1/2 pct largely due to the\ndrop in prices. Exports grew three pct in volume and imports\ntwo pct.\n    In the balance of services, a fall in net investment income\nled to a 300 mln mark deficit in February after a 300 mln mark\nsurplus in January.\n    The deficit in transfer payments widened to 3.70 billion\nmarks from 2.69 billion, largely due to a sharp jump to 2.3\nbillion marks from 200 mln in payments to the European\nCommunity budget.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
