        "BODY": "Jorge Cardenas, manager of Colombia's\ncoffee growers' federation, said he did not believe any\nimportant decisions would emerge from an upcoming meeting of\nthe International Coffee Organization (ICO).\n    The ICO executive board is set to meet in London from March\n31 and could decide to call a special council session by the\nend of April to discuss export quotas.\n    \"It's going to be a routine meeting, an update of what has\nbeen happening in the market, but it's unlikely any major\ndecisions are taken,\" Cardenas told journalists.\n    Earlier this month, talks in London to re-introduce export\nquotas, suspended in February 1986, ended in failure.\n    Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria, also talking to\nreporters at the end of the weekly National Coffee Committee\nmeeting, said the positions of Brazil and of the United States\nwere too far apart to allow a prompt agreement on quotas.\n    Brazil's coffee chief Jorio Dauster said yesterday Brazil\nwould not change its coffee policies.\n    Cardenas said the market situation was getting clearer\nbecause the trade knew the projected output and stockpile\nlevels of producers.\n    He said according to ICO statistics there was a shortfall\nof nine mln (60-kg) bags on the world market between October,\nthe start of the coffee year, and February.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
