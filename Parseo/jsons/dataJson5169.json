        "DATELINE": "    BRUSSELS, March 15 - ",
        "BODY": "Tense trade relations with the U.S.\nAnd Japan and concern about the foreign impact of a proposed\nEuropean Community (EC) tax on edible oils and fats are\nexpected to dominate talks by EC foreign ministers here\ntomorrow.\n    EC diplomats said Britain demanded the early debate on the\nEC Executive Commission's proposal to impose a hefty tax on\ndomestic and imported oils and fats in an attempt to head off a\nproposal it sees as extremely damaging to EC foreign relations.\n    The proposal was the most controversial part of a reform\npackage, due to be discussed by EC farm ministers later this\nmonth, of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy -- widely seen as\nthe root cause of the EC's persistent financial problems and of\ntensions with major trading partners.\n    The proposal is described by its promoters as a\nstabilisation program which would penalise a new sector going\ninto massive overproduction and complement proposals to cut\ncereals and dairy production, rather than a straight forward\ntax.\n    They say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fats\nproduction and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left by\na fall in EC output, but would also save the EC some two\nbillion European Currency Units, over two billion dlrs, in farm\ncosts.\n    It has provoked strong protests from domestic producers as\nwell as foreign exporters, led by the United States.\n    The diplomats said the protests had been received from most\ncorners of the developing and developed world, ranging from\nSenegal, Malaysia and Indonesia, to Brazil, Argentina, Canada,\nIceland and Norway.\n    The proposal had little chance of approval by EC\ngovernments, with West Germany as strongly opposed to it as\nBritain, and Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal also\nunconvinced of its political or economic wisdom.\n    Even Mediterranean countries such as Italy, France and\nGreece, which backed similar proposals in the past, did not\nseem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added to\nthe list of products affected.\n    But the diplomats said a protectionist lobby in the U.S.\nAnd elsewhere was using the proposal as an excuse to promote\nanti-EC action, and the foreign ministers' debate should\ndemonstrate the strength of feeling against the proposal within\nthe EC and deprive its oponents of this argument.\n    The ministers were also due to discuss proposals in the\nU.S. Congress for a range of protecionist legislation such as a\nbill that would curb EC textile exports.\n    The diplomats said the ministers were expected to strongly\nback a Commission warning to Washington that such a bill, if\nenacted, would provoke swift EC retaliation.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
