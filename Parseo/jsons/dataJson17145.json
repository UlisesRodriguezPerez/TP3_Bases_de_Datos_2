        "BODY": "A cargo of U.S. corn for the Soviet\nUnion was rejected and forced to be unloaded at a Chicago\nexport elevator earlier this week after it failed to make\ngrade, with the British vessel Broompark now being reloaded, an\nelevator spokesman said.\n    The first attempt to load the ship failed when the\npercentage of broken kernels proved to be higher than contract\nspecifications, he said.\n    The Soviets traditionally refuse to take sub-grade grain at\na price discount, as is the practice with many other importing\nnations, he added.\n    The official estimated the reloading of the vessel with\nabout 700,000 tonnes of corn may be completed by Tuesday, April\n28.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
