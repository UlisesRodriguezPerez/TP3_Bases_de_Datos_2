        "TITLE": "DOLLAR DROP SEEN AS TEST OF PARIS AGREEMENT",
        "AUTHOR": "    By Franz-Josef Ebel, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    FRANKFURT, March 24 - ",
        "BODY": "The sharp drop in the value of the\ndollar against the yen and the mark is the first serious test\nof last month's Group of Five (G-5) plus Canada agreement to\nstabilise currencies, dealers and bank economists said.\n    \"The dollar will be pushed down until there is coordinated\ncentral bank intervention,\" one dealer for a German bank said,\nechoing widepread sentiment in the market.\n    But opinion was divided on whether the united front forged\nin Paris still exists. Some dealers said there were growing\nsigns the United States wanted the dollar to fall further.\n    Despite repeated Bank of Japan intervention, the dollar\nplunged to a post-war low in Tokyo today. It was quoted as low\nas 148.40 yen in the Far East and dealers here said they\nexpected the U.S. Currency to decline further.\n    \"The dollar is now firmly within a broad 140 to 150 yen\nrange,\" Chase Bank AG's senior dealer Eckhart Hager said.\n    Others said there were technical reasons for the sharp\ndollar drop. \"Window-dressing\" operations by some Japanese\ncompanies who were selling dollars and buying yen before the\nend of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 were undermining\nthe U.S. Currency.\n    Dealers said main reason for the sell-off was not\ntechnical. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's comment the\nParis accord did not have fixed dollar targets was seen as a\nrenewed attempt by the U.S. Administration to talk the dollar\ndown.\n    \"Suddenly, support levels which had existed for fear of\ncentral bank intervention disappeared,\" one dealer said.\n    The Bank of Japan was believed to have bought some 1.5\nbillion dlrs, and this with comments by Japanese officials\nindicated Tokyo was unhappy about the plunge, dealers said.\nBank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita threatened central bank\nintervention if necessary.\n    Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today the\ntime had come for the six nations who agreed in Paris last\nmonth to stabilise currencies - Japan, Britain, Canada, France,\nthe U.S. And West Germany - to take action in line with the\npact.\n    But the Bundesbank and other European central banks were\nnot detected in the open market during the European morning.\nOpinion here was divided on when the Bundesbank would act.\n    While some said the West German central bank would support\nthe dollar once it fell below 1.80 marks, others said the\nBundesbank would only intervene after a fall below 1.75 marks\nor if the decline accelerated.\n    The Bundesbank last intervened on January 27, when the\ndollar threatened to fall below 1.81 marks.\n    \"The Japanese seem to be on their own at the moment,\" one\ndealer said. Others said cooperation between central banks and\ngovernments was easier said than done.\n    Some said Baker's remarks and U.S. Trade Representative\nClayton Yeutter's warning that the U.S. And Japan were on the\nverge of a serious trade conflict showed there was a rift.\n    \"It's hard to tell whether the G-6 agreement still stands,\" a\ndealer said. Another added, \"If the Americans do not get what\nthey want, they will push the dollar down, regardless of G-6.\"\n    Citibank AG also cast doubt on the chances of success for\nthe Paris agreement in its latest investment letter.\n    \"It is hard to see that Japan and Germany are willing or\nable to loosen fiscal policy sufficiently to offset the\nnecessary U.S. Fiscal contraction,\" Citibank said.\n    It added, \"Markets should therefore be aware that 1.80 marks\nis not the lower limit for the dollar -- a rate of 1.70 marks\nor even less is expected this year.\"\n    And London Broker Hoare Govett said in its March 1987\neconomic report, \"We are looking for a further, more gradual,\nfall, possibly to 1.60 marks by the end of the year.\"\n    But opinion about whether the Paris accord was still in\nforce was not universal. Some dealers said not too much should\nbe read into Baker's and Yeutter's comments.\n    \"There is no reason to believe the Paris pact has broken\ndown,\" a senior dealer said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
