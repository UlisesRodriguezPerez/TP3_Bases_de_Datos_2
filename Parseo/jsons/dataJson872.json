        "BODY": "The yen should stabilize at around\n152 to 153 to the U.S. Dollar for about a year, the Bank of\nTokyo's economic adviser Koei Narusawa said.\n    \"Both sides are showing clear interest to secure stability\nof the currencies. The major target of the Japanese government\nis to maintain the yen at above 150, at least for the rest of\nthe year,\" he told reporters during a brief visit to Malaysia.\n    Narusawa said the U.S. Is unlikely to push the yen up\nfurther because this might spark off inflation and depress the\nU.S. Economy before the 1988 presidential election.\n    The yen is trading at around 153.70 to the dollar.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
