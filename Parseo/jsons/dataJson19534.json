        "BODY": "Belgium, current holder of the European\nCommunity presidency, appears ready to drop a controversial\noils and fats tax from this year's hotly-contested farm price\npackage, diplomats said.\n    In a discussion document prepared for today's summit\nmeeting of EC leaders, Belgium proposed the so-called\n\"stabilising mechanism\" be the subject of \"further study and\nconsultation with the Community's main trading partners.\"\n    The proposal for a tax of as much as 330 Ecus per tonne on\nboth imported and domestically-produced vegetable and marine\noils and fats has attracted a storm of international criticism.\n    The discussion document, aimed at preventing a cash row at\nthe summit and breaking the deadlock at this year's farm price\ntalks, contained the first formal reference to dropping the\nmeasure.\n    Britain and Denmark, which assumes the EC presidency on\nJune 30, have led the opposition to the measure. They are\nsupported by West Germany and the Netherlands and, to a lesser\nextent, Spain.\n    Although the paper was not universally welcomed, diplomats\nsaid, the proposal to postpone consideration of the tax for a\nfurther six months was certain to survive any redrafting.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
