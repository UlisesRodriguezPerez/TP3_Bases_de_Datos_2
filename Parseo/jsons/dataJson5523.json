        "BODY": "Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said he\nwas maintaining his 2.5 pct inflation target for 1987 after the\nannouncement earlier today of a 3.4 pct year-on-year rise in\nretail prices for February.\n    He told a radio interviewer he saw no reason to revise his\ntarget for 1987 after the February monthly result of between\n0.1 to O.2 pct, following a 0.9 pct rise in January (three pct\nyear on year) that forced the government to revise an earlier\ntarget of two pct to a current 2.5 pct.\n    He said he was happy with \"a good result\" for February but\nstressed a need for continued \"vigilance\" against inflation.\n    A Finance Ministry statement said the year-on-year\ndifferential between French and lower West German inflation\nrates, calculated on the last three months, had narrowed in\nFebruary to two to 2.3 pct compared to 2.7 pct in January.\n    If calculated on the last 12 months, the differential came\nto 3.9 pct, the statement said, adding \"The tendency is\ntherefore one of a lessening of the inflation gap with our main\ntrading partner.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003"
