        "BODY": "The Belgian government has lowered its\nforecast for the nominal increase in gross national product in\n1987 to 3.5 pct from an originally forecast 3.9 pct, Prime\nMinister Wilfried Martens said in a statement to parliament.\n    He said this revision, which brings government forecasts\nmore closely into line with those by private institutions,\ntakes account of an anticipated slowdown in the world economy\nand international trade.\n    But he said the impact on the Belgian economy will be\nlimited due to recent agreements on wages and working\nconditions agreed by employers and unions.\n    Martens did not say how much the government expected GNP to\ngrow in volume terms.\n    However, last month the government's Planning Bureau said\nit had revised its 1987 forecast for this to 0.9 pct from 2.0\npct.\n    In 1986, Belgium's gross national product rose 2.15 pct in\nvolume terms against a 5.9 pct nominal rise.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
