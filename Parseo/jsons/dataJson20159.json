        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - ",
        "BODY": "Chemical Bank and Marine Midland Banks\nInc said they are cutting their prime lending rate to 9-1/4 pct\nfrom 9-3/4 pct, reversing an increase that they announced just\nlast week.\n    The reduction is effective immediately.\n    No other major U.S. bank had followed the lead of Chemical\nand Marine Midland, preferring to keep their prime rates at\n9-1/4 pct while they waited to see what course money market\nrates would take.\n    Following Monday's record fall in Wall Street stock prices,\nmoney market rates fell sharply on Tuesday as investors\nploughed proceeds into short-term instruments and the Federal\nReserve said it is prepared to provide liquidity to support the\neconomy and the financial system.\n    Eurodollar deposit rates in London fell by as much as 9/16\npercentage point, Treasury bill rates fell by as much as half a\npoint (after falling between 59 and 84 basis points on Monday),\nand the Fed funds rate dropped to 7-1/4 pct from Monday's\naverage of 7.61 pct. Speculation even surfaced of a discount\nrate cut to calm the markets, dealers said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
