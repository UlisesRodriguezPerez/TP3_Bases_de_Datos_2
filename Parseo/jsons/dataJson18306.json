        "BODY": "Widespread, soaking rains aided crop\ndevelopment across the province, with the northwest crop\nproducing region receiving the most precipitation, according to\nthe Manitoba Agriculture weekly crop report.\n    The rains replenished formerly low soil moisture reserves,\nwith reserves in all areas now rated good, the report said.\n    Plantings were virtually complete across the province and\ngermination was well advanced. However, some fields still\nshowed spotty stands.\n    Cereal crops in the southwest were 90 pct germinated, with\nsome fields already in the subsequent tillering stage, it said.\nOilseeds in the northwest region were about 80 pct emerged in\nmany areas, with other regions 50 to 70 pct emerged.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
