        "BODY": "Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige\nhas asked the White House to consider blocking the planned\nJapanese acquisition of a major U.S. Computer and semiconductor\nmaker, U.S. Officials said yesterday.\n    The officials told reporters Baldrige had serious concerns\non national security grounds about the sale of Schlumberger Ltd\n<SLB> unit <Fairchild Semiconductor Inc> to Fujitsu Ltd\n<ITSU.T>. The officials said the sale could leave the United\nStates overly dependent on a foreign company for equipment used\nin advanced missiles, aircraft electronics and intelligence\ngathering.\n    The U.S. Officials added the sale would also worsen the\nstrained relations between the two countries stemming from the\nhuge Japanese trade surplus.\n    The White House Economic Policy Council would consider the\nsale in the coming weeks, they said.\n    Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger's position was not\nknown, but in the past, he has opposed the transfer of high\ntechnology to foreign governments or companies.\n    Computers made by U.S. Manufacturers are widely used in the\nworld, but Tokyo told U.S. Negotiators recently it prefers\nlocal manufacturers and would not buy U.S. Supercomputers.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
