        "BODY": "Plunging Tokyo stock prices will prevent\nthe Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even\nforce it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues,\ngovernment and private economists said.\n    A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark\nfurther selling of shares that could ultimately have a major\ndeflationary impact on the real economy, they said.\n    Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently\nmaintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount\nrate, many in the markets have thought otherwise. \n    Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the\ncentral bank's apparent decision last week to countenance\nhigher rates on commercial bills, dealers said.\n    But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15\npct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to\nraise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about a\nrenewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said.\n    Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the\nmarkets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded\nthe central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount\nrate increase.\n    A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S.\nAnd Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a\nfurther drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. \"They need to\nsupport the stock and security markets,\" he said.\n    But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change\npolicy for the moment, although one admitted that the central\nbank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices\ncontinue to plunge during the rest of the week.\n    Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the\neconomy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary\nimpact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago.\n    With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in\nstock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and\nbusiness confidence, one government economist said.\n    \"There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won't\nbe that big,\" said another.\n    Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their\nown, although they do participate through trust funds and other\ninvestment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turned\nto financial market investments for profits during last year's\neconomic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to\nrefocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.\n    Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is\npartly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have\nshifted funds away from financial investments to increase\ninventories and step up capital spending, one government\neconomist said.\n    In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price\ndrop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices\nwill continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a\ngreater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation,\none central bank official said. \"That will at least take a\ncouple of days, if not weeks,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
