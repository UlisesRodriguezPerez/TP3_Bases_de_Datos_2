        "BODY": "French 1987 growth will probably be about\ntwo pct, the same as last year, due to an international\nenvironment that is less favourable than expected, Finance\nMinister Edouard Balladur was quoted as saying.\n    Treasury director Daniel Lebegue said last month that gross\ndomestic product is expected to grow by between two and 2.5 pct\nthis year, against an original target of 2.8 pct.\n    Although in line with the latest Organisation for Economic\nCooperation and Development (OECD) estimate of 2.1 pct growth,\nthe forecast will be balanced by growth in investments and\nexports, Balladur said in an interview with the daily Les\nEchos.\n    Last month Balladur said French GDP had grown by just two\npct last year, compared with an initial 1986 target of 2.5 pct\nand 1.1 pct growth in 1985.\n    He told Les Echos he aims to reduce the 1988 budget deficit\nto 115 billion francs from this year's figure of 129 billion\nand compared with a 141 billion deficit in 1985.\n    He has already announced his intention of cutting the\ndeficit to 100 billion francs in 1989.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
