        "BODY": "The trade surplus doubled in\nfebruary to 261 mln dlrs from January's 129 mln, but was  below\nthe 628 mln of February 1986, official figures show.\n    The director of the Banco do Brasil's foreign trade\ndepartment (CACEX), Roberto Fendt, told reporters the upturn in\nFebruary confirmed a rising trend in exports, which totalled\n1.53 billion dlrs against 1.26 billion in January and, after\nexcluding coffee and oil derivitives, was only slightly below\nthe same month last year.\n    Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mln\nin February 1986 because of lower prices, he added.\n    Fendt said that although the February results were lower\nthan the average expected for the rest of the year, the\ngovernment's target of an eight-billion-dlr surplus for 1987\nshould be achieved. This would compare with a 1986 surplus of\n9.5 billion dlrs.\n    Exports this year are expected to total 22.5 billion dlrs\nand imports 14.5 billion, he added. In 1986 exports totalled\n22.4 billion dlrs and imports 12.9 billion.\n    Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 1.27 billion\ndlrs from 1.12 billion in February last year was in line with\ngovernment plans to foster economic growth.\n    Fendt said that imports were running at levels well above\nthe traditional average for Brazil.\n    In the first two months of the year imports, excluding oil\nand wheat totalled, 1.8 billion dlrs against 1.47 billion in\nthe same 1986 period.\n    This rise in import demand reflected the needs of Brazilian\nindustry to equip to raise production and is perfectly\ncompatible with the government's program for economic growth,\nFendt added.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
