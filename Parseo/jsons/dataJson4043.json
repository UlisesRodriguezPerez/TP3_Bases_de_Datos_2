        "DATELINE": "    DETROIT, March 11 - ",
        "BODY": "American Motors Corp <AMO> management\nhas ordered a hiring freeze in view of Chrysler Corp's <C> 1.5\nbillion dlr takeover bid, a spokesman for AMC said.\n    Analysts said the merger is virtually certain to go ahead.\n    American Motors directors met for five hours Wednesday to\nreview the takeover proposal. \"The board ... Expects to be\nmeeting periodically over the next several weeks on the\nChrysler proposal,\" AMC said in its first formal statement since\nit acknowledged the Chrysler proposal on Monday.\n    Chrysler, the number three U.S. Automaker, has said the\nmerger is motivated principally by its desire to acquire AMC's\nprofitable Jeep business and dealers, as well as a new modern\ncar assembly plant in Bramalea, Ontario.\n    That means a guaranteed future for much of AMC, but it\nleaves in question the fate of many of its 19,000-plus\nemployees, according to industry analysts. AMC's Toledo, Ohio\nJeep plant has 1,850 hourly workers on indefinite layoff while\nits Kenosha, Wisconsin, car plant has another 2,250 on layoff.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
