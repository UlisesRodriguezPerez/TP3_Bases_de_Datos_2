        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, March 9 - ",
        "BODY": "American Petroleum Institute President\nCharles DiBona said no options should be rejected to combat \ngrowing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.\n    \"No action should be ruled out--import fees or quotas,\nfloor prices, tax incentives or other alternatives--while a\nnational dialogue on the issue continues,\" DiBona said at a \npaper institute conference in New York today.\n    DiBona said there is no unanimity within the industry on\nhow to stimulate energy production but there is consensus on\nremoving several government policies that hinder investments in\nnew prospects.\n    DiBona said the windfall profit tax should be abolished\nimmediately and current proposals for increased environmental\nregulations on acid rain and waste disposal should be not\nadopted. He also suggested that the Arctic National Wildlife\nRefuge in Alaska should be opened up for leasing to oil\ncompanies, DiBona said.\n    \"This is a battle the industry cannot afford to lose if the\nnation is to continue to benefit from Alaskan oil,\" DiBona\nsaid. Since 1986 U.S. oil production has fallen while\nconsumption rose and that has raised dependence on imported\noil, particularly from OPEC, DiBona said.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003"
