        "BODY": "Dixons Group Plc <DXNS.L> said its\ntender offer for all of the common shares in <Cyclops Corp> of\nthe U.S. Expired at midnight yesterday and that it had accepted\napproximately 2.3 mln shares in the company at 90.25 dlrs each.\n    This represents just over 54 pct of the outstanding shares\non a fully diluted basis. But including shares already owned,\nDixons now holds a total of 56 pct of the fully diluted\noutstanding shares.\n    The company said it is now entitled to subscribe for all\nthe authorised but unissued and unreserved shares of common\nstock of Cyclops, which total some 5.4 mln shares, at 90.25\ndlrs each.\n    Dixons said it has waived its condition that 80 pct of the\nfully diluted outstanding shares be validly tendered and not\nwithdrawn.\n    Dixons launched the agreed 384 mln dlr offer on February 17\nthis year in the wake of its unsuccessful battle to take over\nthe U.K. Retail store chain Woolworth Holdings Plc <WLUK.L>.\n    Dixons shares were last quoted at 390p, up on last night's\nclose of 380p.\n    On Friday, <CYACQ Corp>, an investor group formed by\nAudio/Video Affiliates Inc <AVA> and Citicorp <CCI>, said it\nwould increase the price it was offering for all Cyclops shares\nto 92.50 dlrs from 80.00 dlrs each if Cyclops would provide it\nwith confidential information given to Dixons and if it were\nsatisfied that any rights Dixon might have to recover fees or\nexpenses from Dixons or to buy Cyclops stock would be rescinded\nor proved invalid.\n    Audio/Video's offer is scheduled to expire March 20.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
