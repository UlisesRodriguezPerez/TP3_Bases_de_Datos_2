        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 17 - ",
        "BODY": "Energy Secretary John Herrington\nsaid he may recommend to the White House that the domestic oil\nindustry be given tax benefits to help it produce more oil and\nhead off increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.\n    He said also at a news conference that he would recommend\nto the White House that the fill rate of the Strategic\nPetroleum Reserve be increased from its planned 35,000 barrels\nper day.\n    The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels a\nday.\n    Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill rate\nfor the petroleum reserve, but the rate had been kept down\nbecause of budgetary constraints.\n    Herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he might\nadvocate, but U.S. officials have shown interest in tax\nbenefits for oil and gas exploration and for research and\ndevelopment into new ways to extract oil which is now\nconsidered uneconomical to produce.\n    He made the remarks in conjunction with the release of the\nEnergy Department's study on oil's impact on national security.\n    Herrington said that before he disclosed what\nrecommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industry\nhe might make, he would raise the matter with the White House\nEconomic Policy Committee to see if the proposals to increase\noil production made good tax policy.\n    He said he would like to increase U.S. production by one\nmln barrels a day.\n    The report said that by the end of the century the United\nStates may be relying on foreign sources for 50 pct of its oil\nconsumption, posing a serious economic and national security\nthreat.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
