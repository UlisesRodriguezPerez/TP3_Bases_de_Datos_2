        "BODY": "Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige\nsaid the United States would go ahead with planned 300 mln dlr\nsanctions against Japanese semiconductor exports, despite any\nU.S. Japanese talks to avert the trade curbs.\n    He said in a speech to an export-import group that he was\nsure the United States and Japan could work out their dispute\nover unfair Japanese trade practices in semiconductor trade,\nbut \"I am sure the sanctions will go in before we work it out.\"\n    Sanctions are to be imposed on April 17.\n    He also said he did not think there would be a trade war\nwith Japan, because Japan had too much value in exports to the\nUnited States to risk such a war.\n    \"Those fears are unfounded,\" he said.\n    He told reporters later that the sharp drop in the\nsecurities market was not due to fears of a trade war, but fear\nof inflation and that the Federal Reserve may act on that fact.\n    Market reaction was also due, he said, to the drop in the\nvalue of the dollar, although trade issues did have some\neffect.\n    Baldrige said that observers who were attributing the drop\nin the market to trade sanctions were \"barking up the wrong\ntree.\"\n    He said the market observers will realize this shortly.\n    Baldrige said his remarks did not mean to suggest anything\nabout the market or the exchange rate of the dollar.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
