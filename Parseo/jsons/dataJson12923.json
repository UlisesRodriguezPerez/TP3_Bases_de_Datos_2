        "BODY": "The Federal Reserve is expected to take\nno reserve-management action in the U.S. Government securities\nmarket during its usual intervention period, economists said.\n    They said that, if the Fed does act, it will likely add\ntemporary reserves indirectly by arranging one to 1.5 billion\ndlrs of customer repurchase agreements.\n    Federal funds, which averaged 6.14 pct yesterday, opened at\n5-15/16 pct and remained there in early trading. Analysts\nbelieve this probably is about where the Fed wants the funds\nrate to be.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
