        "BODY": "U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard\nLyng said the United States will continue its policy of\nsubsidizing farm exports to regain lost markets until there is\na global agreement to end such subsidies.\n    In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also acknowledged he was\ntroubled by the prospect that the export enhancement program\n(EEP) could prove so indispensable to boosting U.S. exports\nthat the U.S. would have difficulty abandoning it.\n    \"Yes, I'm troubled with that a little bit,\" he said. \"There's\nno question about it, the longer you feed the calf on the cow,\nthe longer it is to wean it.\"\n    In recent months, USDA has offered subsidies on a growing\nlist of commodities to an increasing number of countries.\n    Lyng called U.S. and European Community export subsidies\n\"just plain nonsensical as a long-term policy\" and said he saw an\nend to the expansion of the EEP.\n    \"I'm sure there's an end to the expansion, but we are doing\nthis to accomplish our goal which is to regain the markets that\nwe've lost, to keep our products competitive and to let those,\nparticularly the European Community, who, we are convinced, are\nthe worst offenders in terms of the export subsidization, that\nwe are prepared to continue to do this until we can come to\nsome agreement to put an end to it,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
