        "TITLE": "MAJOR EUROPEAN ZINC SMELTER MERGER SEEN BY 1990",
        "DATELINE": "    AMSTERDAM, June 16 - ",
        "BODY": "There should be at least one merger\nbetween major European zinc smelters before the end of the\ndecade, Christian Bue, Executive Vice President (commercial) of\nSMM Penarroya in France, said.\n    Speaking on the second day of the Metal Bulletin base\nmetals conference, Bue said he expected the current talks\nbetween five smelters including Penarroya to result in\nintegration between at least some of the companies before 1990.\n    The five companies, SMM Penarroya, Outokumpu Oy, Preussag\nAg, Ste de la Vieille Montagne and Boliden Ore and Metals AB,\nhave 22 pct of the world market, Bue added.\n    \"We have no alternative than to integrate out businesses\ninto large trading blocs if we are to survive the cut-throat\nprice competition and the trend to forward integration from the\nmining companies,\" Bue said.\n    \"It is by no means certain that all the five companies\ninvolved in the talks will integrate together. It is quite\nlikely, and even preferable, that the European smelters form\ntwo or three large integrated blocs.\n    \"In this way we will be better able to negotiate with our\nconcentrate suppliers on one side, and with the metal buyers on\nthe other,\" Bue added.\n    In the past, production overcapacity and the intense\ncompetition between the European zinc smelters has meant they\nhave not only been in a very weak negotiating position when\nbuying concentrates, but in an even weaker one when selling the\nmetal, Bue noted.\n    Although the apparently easy solution is to simply shut\ndown excess capacity, the burden of this on individual\ncompanies is far too heavy and no one can be expected to\nvolunteer, he added.\n    Another possible but very risky solution is to invest\nheavily in more modern and lower cost facilities, he said.\n    \"My answer to this suggestion is that individual companies\nwho do not invest will surely die, and those that do invest\nmight survive, but only might, \" Bue said.\n    \"The only real option in my mind is integration,\nrationalization and stabilization. We have no alternative, \" he\nadded.\n    Bue also said that the European smelters were completely\ndissatisfied with the tradition of pricing concentrates and\nmetals in US dollars, and suggested moving either to a basket\nof the world's major currencies or pricing in European currency\nunits (Ecus) to protect against exchange rate volatility.\n    Bue's views on integration between European smelters were\nmet by general approval from the conference audience comprising\nrepresentatives from many of the world's major mining, smelting\nand trading companies, although some of the mining\nrepresentatives were somewhat sceptical in view of their own\nindustry's move towards integration with smelters.\n    However, some concentrate traders did express worry about\ntheir own position if the metals industry does make the move to\nlarge trading blocs.\n    The currency basket suggestion cropped up constantly, but\nfew said they thought matters would change in the near future.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
