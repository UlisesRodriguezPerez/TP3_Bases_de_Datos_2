        "BODY": "<Aramco Corp> has accepted Japanese\nnominations to lift a higher proportion of Arab Heavy crude oil\nunder term contracts in July, oil industry sources said.\n    Japanese companies requested a ratio of 80 pct Arab Heavy\nto 20 pct Arab Light under a term contract agreement with\nAramco for 100,000 barrels per day, the sources said. The\ncontractual ratio is 30 pct heavy crude to 70 pct light.\n    Japanese demand for heavy crude oil has increased\nsubstantially since the All Japan Seaman's Union ceased sailing\ninto the northern Mideast gulf last month, causing problems\nwith liftings of heavy Kuwait and Khafji crudes.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
