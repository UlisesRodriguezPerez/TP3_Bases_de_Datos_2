        "BODY": "Financial and industrial holding company\nNord Est plans to make a convertible bond issue for a total of\n400 mln francs, President Gustave Rambaud said.\n    He told a news conference Nord-Est expected to receive\napproval from the Bourse supervisory body COB in the next two\nweek, when terms would set according to market conditions.\n    He said the issue was meant to boost capital ahead of new\ninvestments.\n    Rambaud said the company would pay a 1986 dividend of 5.25\nfrancs, unchanged on 1985. Parent company net profit last year\nrose to 99.5 mln francs against 71.1 mln in 1985.\n    Provisional consolidated profits were lower at 185 mln\nfrancs compared with 200 mln in 1985, of which 120 mln, against\n147 mln, was attributable to the group. He said the lower\nprofit was mainly due to losses made by steel-tube maker\nVallourec, in which Nord Est has a 12.5 pct stake.\n    Rambaud said he forecast a 1987 parent company net profit\nbefore provisions of around 135 mln francs.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
