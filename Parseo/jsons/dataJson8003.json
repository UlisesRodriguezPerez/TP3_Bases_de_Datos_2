        "BODY": "Total food aid needs in 69 of the\nleast developed countries declined in 1986/87, as requirments\nfell in many countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, the\nU.S. Agriculture Department said.\n    In a summary of its World Agriculture Report, the\ndepartment said grain production in sub-Saharan Africa was a\nrecord high in 1986, with gains in almost every country.\n    However, food needs in Central America rose, worsened by\ndrought-reduced crops and civil strife.\n    Record wheat production in 1986/87 is pushing global wheat\nconsumption for food to a new high, and higher yielding\nvarieties have been particularly effective where spring wheat\nis a common crop, it said.\n    However, may developing countries in tropical climates,\nsuch as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central\nAmerica, are not well adapted for wheat production, and\nimproved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs, the\ndepartment said.\n    World per capita consumption of vegetable oil will rise in\n1986/87 for the third straight year.\n    Soybean oil constitutes almost 30 pct of vegetable oil\nconsumption, while palm oil is the most traded, the department\nsaid.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
