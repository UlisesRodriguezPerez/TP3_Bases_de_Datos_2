        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 12 - ",
        "BODY": "U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard\nLyng said he was not sure a long-term U.S.-Soviet grain\nagreement would be worth extending when it expires next year.\n    \"It hasn't been worth much in the last two years....They\nhaven't lived up to the agreement as I see it,\" Lyng said in an\ninterview with Reuters.\n    \"It would be my thought that it's not worth any effort to\nwork out an agreement with someone who wants the agreement to\nbe a one-sided thing,\" he said.\n    However, Lyng said he did not want to make a \"definitive\ncommitment one way or another at this point.\"\n    Under the accord covering 1983-88, the Soviets agreed to\nbuy at least nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain, including four mln\ntonnes each of corn and wheat.\n    Moscow bought 6.8 mln tonnes of corn and 153,000 tonnes of\nwheat during the third agreement year, which ended last\nSeptember, and this year has bought one mln tonnes of corn.\n    Lyng said he had no knowledge of how much U.S. grain Moscow\nwould buy this year.\n    \"I've seen people making comments on that and I don't know\nhow they know, unless they talk to the Soviets,\" he said. \"I have\nno knowledge, and I really don't think anyone other than the\nSoviets have any knowledge.\"\n    Lyng said he thought the Soviets bought U.S. corn last\nmonth because \"they needed it and because the price was right.\"\n    \"Our corn has been pretty reasonably priced. And I think\nthey've always found that our corn was good,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
