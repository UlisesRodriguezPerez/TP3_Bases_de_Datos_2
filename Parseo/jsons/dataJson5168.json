        "BODY": "A senior Ivory Coast Agriculture\nMinistry official confirmed his country's backing for a new\ninternational cocoa pact and said Ivorian delegates would be\npresent at talks on its buffer stock starting this week.\n    The official told Reuters that Ivorian Agriculture Minister\nDenis Bra Kanon would attend the opening of the talks, convened\nby the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO), in London on\nMonday.\n    While Bra Kanon is due to return home this week for funeral\nceremonies for a sister of Ivorian President Felix\nHouphouet-Boigny, scheduled to be held in the country's capital\nYamoussoukro between March 19-22, senior Ivorian delegates will\nbe present throughout the London talks, the official said.\n    Bra Kanon is chairman of the ICCO Council and rumours that\nhe or Ivorian delegates might be delayed because of public\nmourning in the West African nation helped depress already low\nworld cocoa prices Friday.\n    The official said Ivory Coast continued to support the new\npact, which was agreed in principle last year by most of the\nworld's cocoa exporters and consumers.\n    He also said Bra Kanon would fulfil his duties as ICCO\nCouncil chairman during the talks, scheduled to end on March\n27.\n    The meeting aims to set rules for the operation of the\npact's buffer stock which producers hope will boost a market\nhit by successive world cocoa surpluses.\n    Ivory Coast did not participate in the last international\ncocoa pact and its decision to join the new accord has sparked\nhopes that it will be more successful in supporting prices.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
