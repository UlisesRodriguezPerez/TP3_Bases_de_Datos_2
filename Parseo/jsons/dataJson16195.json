        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, April 13 - ",
        "BODY": "U.K. Producer price data for March were\nroughly as expected after taking into account technical factors\nwhich affected the year-on-year outcome, economic analysts\nsaid.\n    The figures showed a 0.3 pct provisional, non-seasonally\nadjusted rise in output prices in March, unchanged from\nFebruary and close to the average for the last six months.\n    The year-on-year rise was put at 3.7 pct, down from 4.2 pct\nin February.\n    But Chris Tinker, economist at brokerage house Phillips and\nDrew, said the drop in the year-on-year rate mainly reflected a\nrise in excise duties which affected the index in March last\nyear.\n    He cautioned that it was dangerous to read too much into\nthe monthly figure, adding that a rise of only 0.2 pct in April\nwould take the year-on-year rise back above 4.2 pct.\n    Analysts also noted that a drop in manufacturers' input\nprices was almost entirely due to anticipated seasonal factors\nsuch as a fall in industrial electricity costs.\n    Duncan Squire of Lloyds Merchant Bank said the figures were\nslightly disappointing in that the strengthening of sterling\nhad not yet reduced input prices as much as expected.\n    Both he and Tinker said this factor should help keep input\ncosts down over the next few months, although Tinker added that\nlast year's fall in oil prices is now about to drop out of the\nyear-on-year comparisons and is likely to lead to a return to\nrises in the index rather than falls.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
