        "BODY": "Prospects for renewal of the\nfive-year U.S./USSR grains agreement are uncertain at this\npoint, a Soviet trade official told Reuters.\n    The current trade imbalance between the United States and\nthe Soviet Union, high U.S. commodity prices, and increased\nworld grain production make a renewal of the supply agreement\nnext year less certain, Albert Melnikov, deputy trade\nrepresentative of the Soviet Union, said in an interview.\n    The current agreement expires on Sept 30, 1988.\n    Melnikov said that world grain markets are different than\nwhen the first agreement was signed in 1975.\n    Statements from both U.S. and Soviet officials have\nindicate that a long term grains agreement might not be as\nattractive for both sides as it once was.\n    \"We have had one agreement. We have had a second agreement,\nbut with the second agreement we've had difficulties with\nprices,\" Melnikov said.\n    \"I cannot give you any forecasts in response to the future\nabout the agreement.... I do not want to speculate on what will\nhappen after Sept 30, 1988,\" he said.\n    Melnikov noted that he has seen no indications from Soviet\ngovernment officials that they would be pushing for a renewal\nof the agreement.\n    \"The situation is different in comparison to three, five or\nten years ago ... We can produce more,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
