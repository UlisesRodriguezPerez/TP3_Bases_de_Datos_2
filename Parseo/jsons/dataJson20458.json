        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, Oct 20 - ",
        "BODY": "Britain's highest court has decided the\nInternational Tin Council (ITC) can appeal over the use of ITC\ndocuments in court actions.\n    On November 2 the House of Lords will decide if and to what\nextent ITC documents, whether circulated or not, are admissible\nas court evidence. Lawyers working in the legal tangle left\nfrom the October 1985 collapse of the tin market said this\nhearing is likely to last a few days.\n    On Wednesday the Court of Appeal will link the outstanding\nITC cases that have so far reached it and a single set of\nhearings could begin in early January, they added.\n    The House of Lords ruling on the use of ITC documents will\nbe referred back to the action by two Shearson Lehman companies\nagainst the London Metal Exchange although the underlying case\nis not expected to be resumed until mid-1988.\n    The Court of Appeal hearings include action between brokers\nand cases by brokers and banks against the ITC and the member\ngovernments of the tin council.\n    Action taken by brokers seeking both the winding up of the\nITC or and placing it into receivership will also be covered by\nthe Court of Appeal legal schedule.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
