        "TITLE": "SOYBEAN GROUPS MEET WITH LYNG TO DISCUSS LOAN",
        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 16 - ",
        "BODY": "A high-level meeting last week which\nincluded the Secretary of Agriculture and other senior  USDA\nofficials, along with leaders of the major soybean lobbying\ngroups, failed to reach any decision on what should be done\nabout the soybean loan level, participants at the meeting told\nReuters.\n    \"We didn't feel a lot was accomplished last week, but we\nwere delighted to meet with the Secretary, and he didn't close\nthe door on anything,\" a member of the soybean delegation said.\n    At issue is the current soybean loan and the fact that at\nthe present level of 4.77 dlrs (without Gramm-Rudman\nreductions) it encourages foreign soybean production by making\nsoybeans more profitable to grow than corn.\n    But while recognizing that soybeans are priced too high in\nrelation with corn, soybean groups have pledged their support\nto maintaining current price supports for soybean growers.\n    Leaders of the American Soybean Association and the\nNational Soybean Processors Association offered specific loan\noptions to USDA Secretary Lyng in last week's meeting, but\nparticipants would not reveal what those options were.\n    \"There were no surprises in our package,\" one participant\nsaid. Bandied about for several weeks has been the idea of\noffering producers soybean loans partially in cash and in\ncertificates.\n    The most prevailing scheme would be to pay a 4.77 loan with\n77 cts worth of soybean-specific certificates which would not\nhave to be paid back and the remaining four dlrs in cash.\n    This would have the effect of lowering the world price,\nmaintaining domestic support levels and reducing the\ngovernment's soybean inventory.\n    A marketing loan for soybeans was not discussed at last\nweek's meeting, participants said.\n    One member of the soybean delegation said that the meeting\nwas a \"listening session\" for USDA, and that the proposals will\nnow be studied further by the Department.\n    USDA officials, however, would not commit to any time\nframe. Participants in the meeting do not look for changes in\nthe soybean loan to be announced in the near future.\n    \"USDA is very sensitive about saying anything that could\ninfluence the market, so the Secretary was very non-committal,\"\na participant said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
