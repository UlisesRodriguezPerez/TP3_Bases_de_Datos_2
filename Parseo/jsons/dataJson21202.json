        "BODY": "International monetary officials will \nrush to paper over the deep cracks that have appeared in the\nLouvre accord on currency stability to prevent a dollar\nfree-fall and to calm turmoil in world capital markets,\neconomists and currency traders said.\n    \"I don't think the Louvre is dead because if it breaks up\nin an acrimonious way, the potential outcome is a rout of the\ndollar, higher interest rates and collapsing stock markets.\nIt's in the Group of Seven's interest to calm things down,\"\nsaid Douglas Madison, corporate trader at BankAmerica Corp.\n   \n    In a weekend television interview, U.S. Treasury secretary\nJames Baker sharply criticised a recent rise in West German\nmoney market rates and said the eight month-old Louvre pact to\nfoster exchange rate stability needs to be reviewed.\n    His comments rocked the currency markets and helped send\nthe already-fragile U.S. and overseas stock markets into a\ntailspin.\n    The dollar lost more than two pfennigs in the U.S. to about\n1.7740/50 marks and about one yen to 141.25/35 yen. The Dow\nJones Industrial Average slumped more than 200 points at one\nstage and U.S. Treasury bonds dropped about 1-3/4 points.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003"
