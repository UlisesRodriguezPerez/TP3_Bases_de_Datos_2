        "BODY": "South Korea plans to import about 387,000\ntonnes of cotton this year compared to 225,000 tonnes in 1986,\ntrade ministry officials said.\n    More than three quarters of the total, some 290,000 tonnes,\nwill come from the United States. That will be a 93.7 pct\nincrease on 1986 when U.S. Imports totalled 150,000 tonnes, an\nofficial said.\n    He said the U.S. Increase is due partly to the\ncompetitiveness of American cotton and partly to efforts by\nSeoul to reduce its trade surplus with Washington. South Korea\nis the second largest importer of U.S. Cotton after Japan.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
