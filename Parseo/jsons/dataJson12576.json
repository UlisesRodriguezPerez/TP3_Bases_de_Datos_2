        "BODY": "Bank of Spain governor Mariano Rubio said\nthe central bank was worried that money supply was growing too\nfast, reflecting excessive internal demand in the Spanish\neconomy, but added that he was confident recent measures would\nsucceed in restricting money growth.\n    In testimony to the economic commission of Congress, Rubio\nsaid the main measure of money supply, the broad-based Liquid\nAssets in Public Hands, grew at an estimated annualised rate of\n17 pct in March, the same as in February.\n    The bank's target range for growth in this measure in 1987\nis 6.5 to 9.5 pct, compared with 11.4 pct last year.\n    Rubio said he was aiming for the lower end of the range.\n    He added that real GDP growth of three pct in 1986 was due\nto a six pct increase in real internal demand and a three pct\nreal drop in the contribution of the external sector.\n    The aim for 1987 was for the same real growth in GDP but a\ndrop in the internal contribution to 4.5 pct with the negative\ncomponent of the external sector trimmed to 1.5 pct, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
