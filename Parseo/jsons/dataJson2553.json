        "BODY": "Costa Rica's economy minister said he\nsees new hope for winning changes in the International Coffee\nOrganisation system of export quotas.\n    Minister Luis Diego Escalante, who serves as president of\nthe Costa Rican Coffee Institute, said he was hopeful because\nof the support offered Costa Rica and other smaller producing-\nnations by such major consumers as the United States, Britain\nand the Netherlands at last week's ICO meeting in london.\n    Escalante told a news conference here he \"carried the weight\nof the negotiations\" at the meeting by calling for larger export\nquotas for the smaller coffee-growing nations.\n    Costa rica is insisting, Escalante said, on a new quota\nsystem based on a producing nation's real export capacity, once\nit has satisfied internal demand.\n    \"There are countries such as our own whose sales\npossibilities are close to or above 100 pct of their current\nquotas,\" Escalante said.\n    At the same time, there are countries favoured by the\ncurrent system that have been assigned quotas far above their\nexport potential, he said.\n    The current ICO quota system is \"unfair and autocratic,\"\nEscalante said.\n    Escalante attributed the nosedive in international coffee\nprices over the last week to speculation rather than real\nmatters of supply and demand.\n    \"Be careful,\" he warned, \"there's not as much coffee in the\nworld as they say. What there is are bags of sawdust.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
