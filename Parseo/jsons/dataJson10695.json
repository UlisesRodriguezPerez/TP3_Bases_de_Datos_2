        "TITLE": "JAPAN HAS LITTLE NEW TO OFFER IN MICROCHIP DISPUTE",

        "BODY": "The Japanese government appears to have\nlittle new to offer to settle a dispute with the U.S. Over\ncomputer chips, trade analysts and government officials said.\n    The U.S. Has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300\nmln dlrs on Japanese electronics exports to the U.S., In\nretaliation for Japan's alleged failure to keep a pact on the\nmicrochip trade signed last September.\n    A Foreign Ministry official told Reuters \"Japan has done\nwhat it can, and now we must persuade the United States to wait\nfor those steps to take effect.\"\n    The U.S. Alleges that, in defiance of the September\nagreement, Japan is still selling microchips at below cost in\nnon-U.S. Markets and refusing to open Japan further to U.S.\nChip sales. U.S. Tariffs are due to take effect on April 17.\n     Analysts noted Japan's Ministry of International Trade and\nIndustry (MITI) has already ordered chipmakers to cut\nproduction in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold in\nthird countries at non-regulated prices.\n    \"I'm not sure MITI can do much more than it has,\" said\nJardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards.\n    A MITI official said the Ministry was not planning to call\nfor production cuts beyond those already sought, although it\nwould continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods.\n    Spokesmen for some Japanese electronics firms said they\nwould consider buying more U.S. Chips. But a Matsushita\nElectric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase in\nimports was not likely.\n    Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit if\nthe United States did implement the tariffs, which would be\nlevied on consumer electronics products rather than on\nmicrochips themselves.\n    \"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time,\nthere will be complete erosion of exports to the United States,\"\nsaid Tom Murtha, analyst at James Capel and Co.\n    \"The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be\nstopped altogether, but recovery for the industry will be\ndelayed for another year,\" he said.\n    Some analysts said tariffs would also harm U.S. Industry by\nstepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japan\nfor semiconductors U.S. Firms are trying to sell here.\n    \"The American approach is full of contradictions,\" Jardine\nFleming's Edwards said.\n    \"If they want to expand (U.S.) exports, the last thing they\nwant to do is hit the makers of the final products because that\nhurts the final market,\" Edwards said.\n    But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just U.S.\nConcern over what it sees as a strategic industry, but also\nfrustration with Japan's vast trade surplus. Some analysts\nargued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may have\nto take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact.\n    Carole Ryavec, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd,\nsaid \"The major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic\neconomy and move away from an export-dependent economy.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003"
