        "BODY": "Fading hope for passengers trapped aboard\na partially-sunk Channel ferry raised fears the accident could\nrank among this centuries' worst peacetime shipping tragedies.\n    Belgian Transport Minister Herman de Croo said there was no\nhope of rescuing any of about 220 passengers trapped in the\nHerald of Free Enterprise after it capsized off the Belgian\ncoast last night.\n    If confirmed, the toll would make the incident the world's\nworst since a Soviet liner, the Admiral Nakhimov, collided with\na freighter in the Black Sea last September and sank with the\nloss of nearly 400 lives. A further 856 people were rescued.\n    The world's deadliest single peacetime incident at sea was\nthe sinking in 1912 of the Titanic with a loss of 1,500 lives.\n    The second biggest loss of life in peacetime was in 1914\nwhen 1,014 people drowned when the liner Empress of Ireland\ncollided with a freighter on the St Lawrence river in Canada.\n    The world's worst maritime disaster was in wartime that\ntook 7,700 lives when the German liner Wilhelm Gustloff was\ntorpedoed by a Soviet submarine in January 30, 1945.\n    In 1985, more than 200 were feared dead after two ferries\nsank near Dhaka, 174 drowned when a ferry capsized in China and\n147 died when a launch sank off the Malaysian state of Sabah.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
