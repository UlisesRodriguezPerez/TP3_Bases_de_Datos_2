        "BODY": "Considerable uncertainty surrounds the\noutcome of today's EC white sugar tender, traders here said,\nnoting it remains overshadowed by European operator threats to\nmove over 800,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention.\n    They said that due to the dispute between the Commission\nand producers over the issue, it is not clear whether the\nCommission will authorise any exports at all or grant licences\non a large tonnage.\n    The subsidy is seen being set above 45.00 Ecus per 100\nkilos, although traders are reluctant to predict a precise\nlevel after prices fell yesterday.\n    Earlier, traders in Paris said they expected the Commission\nto award licences for around 50,000 tonnes of white sugar with\na maximum export rebate of 45.75 to 46.0 Ecus.\n    Last week, the Commission granted licences to end August on\n60,500 tonnes of whites at a maximum rebate of 44.819.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
