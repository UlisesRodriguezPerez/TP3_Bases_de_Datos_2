        "BODY": "West German gross fishmeal imports rose\n60,260 tonnes, or 14.6 pct, last year to 471,891 tonnes, the\nhighest level since 1972, trade sources said.\n    Re-exports fell by 6.6 pct, resulting in a surge in net\nimports from 175,901 to 251,708 tonnes, an increase of 43 pct.\n    Total West German consumption was estimated at around a\nhigh 287,000 tonnes, largely reflecting attractive prices. The\nsources, however, could not give comparative figures for 1985.\n    South American producer countries supplied 97 pct of West\nGerman requirements, with Chile shipping 229,176 tonnes (1985 -\n182,959) and Peru 210,513 (147,014) tonnes.\n    The two South American countries' share of the West German\nmarket rose to 93.2 pct from 80.2 pct because imports from\nEcuador fell to 21,110 tonnes in 1986 from 51,722 in 1985.\n    West Germany imported 56,823 tonnes of fishmeal in\nDecember, up from 46,236 tonnes in the same 1985 month, with\nre-exports at 22,262 tonnes after 25,062 a year earlier.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
