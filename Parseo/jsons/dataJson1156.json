        "BODY": "Nigeria and Guinea agreed to set up a new\ncompany with Liberia to carry out the 14-year-old\nMifergui-Nimba iron ore project, an official communique said.\n    The communique was issued after two days of talks here\nbetween Guinean natural resources minister Ousmane Sylla and\nNigerian minister of mines and power Bunu Sheriff Musa.\n    Originally, Guinea held 50 pct in the project and Nigeria\n16.2 pct with firms from several other countries also involved,\nbut the project ran into problems over funding and the slump in\nworld iron ore markets.\n    Musa said Liberia was invited to join and its share will be\ndecided after a project feasibility study. This would be\ncompleted in May after which finance will be sought. Officials\nsaid the study will be undertaken with the help of the World\nBank, which is also expected to give financial support.\n    Production, originally estimated at 15 mln tonnes a year,\nwill be 12 mln initially and is expected to begin in early\n1990.\n    On an agreement between the two countries to prospect for\nuranium in Guinea, the communique said Musa and Sylla agreed\nthat because of poor market conditions, it would be extended to\ncover exploration for gold, diamonds, cobalt, nickel and\nsilver.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
