        "DATELINE": "    SYDNEY, April 8 - ",
        "BODY": "Good rains of one to four inches in the\npast 10 days have boosted moisture-stressed sugar cane crops in\nthe Mackay-Burdekin region of Queensland's central coast, an\nAustralian Sugar Producers' Association spokesman said.\n    As previously reported, the region has been undergoing a\nsevere dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, since\nDecember, following the virtual failure of the summer wet\nseason.\n    Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are\nbeginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth\nsince the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane.\n    Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much better\nthan it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesman\nsaid. But is too early to say what they will be and more rain\nis needed to restore sub-soil moisture.\n    Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg region\nand southern Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition and\nsome mills are forecasting record crops, he said.\n    Initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled\ntowards the end of May, he said.\n    The cane crush normally runs from June to December.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
