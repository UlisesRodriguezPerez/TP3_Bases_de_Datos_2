        "BODY": "The Agriculture Ministry declined comment\non a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talks\non its closed rice market in the new GATT round.\n    \"We have no idea about the report and cannot comment,\" a\nspokesman told Reuters.\n    Nihon Keizai Shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources,\nsaid Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng\nand U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of its\nintentions. The two are due to visit Japan later this month for\nfarm talks.\n    The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue\nat the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\ntalks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum.\n    Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the Foodstuff\nControl Act.\n    Nihon Keizai said Japan's plan resulted from worries about\nmounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks, Japan\nwill try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy is\njustified, it said.\n    The 93-nation world trade body began the Uruguay trade\nround last September. It will take four years to negotiate.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
