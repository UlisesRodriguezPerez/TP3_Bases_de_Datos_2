        "TITLE": "PHILIPPINE SUGAR CROP SET AT 1.6 MLN TONNES",

        "BODY": "Philippine sugar production in the\n1987/88 crop year ending August has been set at 1.6 mln tonnes,\nup from a provisional 1.3 mln tonnes this year, Sugar\nRegulatory Administration (SRA) chairman Arsenio Yulo said.\n    Yulo told Reuters a survey during the current milling\nseason, which ends next month, showed the 1986/87 estimate\nwould almost certainly be met.\n    He said at least 1.2 mln tonnes of the 1987/88 crop would\nbe earmarked for domestic consumption.\n    Yulo said about 130,000 tonnes would be set aside for the\nU.S. Sugar quota, 150,000 tonnes for strategic reserves and\n50,000 tonnes would be sold on the world market.\n    He said if the government approved a long-standing SRA\nrecommendation to manufacture ethanol, the project would take\nup another 150,000 tonnes, slightly raising the target.\n    \"The government, for its own reasons, has been delaying\napproval of the project, but we expect it to come through by\nJuly,\" Yulo said.\n    Ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline, cutting the oil\nimport bill by about 300 mln pesos.\n    Yulo said three major Philippine distilleries were ready to\nstart manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved.\n    The ethanol project would result in employment for about\n100,000 people, sharply reducing those thrown out of work by\ndepressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry.\n    Production quotas, set for the first time in 1987/88, had\nbeen submitted to President Corazon Aquino.\n    \"I think the President would rather wait till the new\nCongress convenes after the May elections,\" he said. \"But there\nis really no need for such quotas. We are right now producing\njust slightly over our own consumption level.\"\n    \"The producers have never enjoyed such high prices,\" Yulo\nsaid, adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesos\nper picul, up from 190 pesos last August.\n    Yulo said prices were driven up because of speculation\nfollowing the SRA's bid to control production.\n    \"We are no longer concerned so much with the world market,\"\nhe said, adding producers in the Negros region had learned from\ntheir mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming and\ncloth production.\n    He said diversification into products other than ethanol\nwas also possible within the sugar industry.\n    \"The Brazilians long ago learnt their lessons,\" Yulo said.\n\"They have 300 sugar mills, compared with our 41, but they\nrelocated many of them and diversified production. We want to\ncall this a 'sugarcane industry' instead of the sugar industry.\"\n    He said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock, used\nfor thatching roofs, or used in room panelling.\n    \"When you cut sugarcane you don't even have to produce\nsugar,\" he said.\n    Yulo said the Philippines was lobbying for a renewal of the\nInternational Sugar Agreement, which expired in 1984.\n    \"As a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a new\nagreement which would revive world prices,\" Yulo said.\n    \"If there is no agreement world prices will always be\ndepressed, particularly because the European Community is\nsubsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets.\"\n    He said current world prices, holding steady at about 7.60\ncents per pound, were uneconomical for the Philippines, where\nproduction costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound.\n    \"If the price holds steady for a while at 7.60 cents I\nexpect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the end\nof this year,\" he said.\n    Yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by\n1990, with world consumption outstripping production.\n    He said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachments\nfrom artificial sweeteners and high-fructose corn syrup.\n    \"But we are not happy with the Reagan Administration,\" he\nsaid. \"Since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to the\nU.S. In 1982, when they restored the quota system, they cut\nours in half without any justification.\"\n    Manila was keenly watching Washington's moves to cut\ndomestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents.\n    The U.S. Agriculture Department last December slashed its\n12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the Philippines to\n143,780 short tons from 231,660 short tons in 1986.\n    Yulo said despite next year's increased production target,\nsome Philippine mills were expected to shut down.\n    \"At least four of the 41 mills were not working during the\n1986/87 season,\" he said. \"We expect two or three more to follow\nsuit during the next season.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003"
