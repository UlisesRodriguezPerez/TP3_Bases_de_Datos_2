        "DATELINE": "    CASS CITY, MICH., March 30 - ",
        "BODY": "Walbro Corp said it expects\nits first-quarter results to reach \"all-time highs.\"\n    It projected sales exceeding 32 mln dlrs, or up 21 pct from\nthe 26,488,000 dlrs reported for the 1986 first quarter. It\nsaid the previous high for a single quarter was 27,179,000 dlrs\nfor the 1986 fourth quarter.\n    Walbro estimated income for the quarter will exceed\nfirst-quarter 1986 income, which was 1,953,000 dlrs, or 66 cts\na share, by at least 40 pct. It said the first quarter of 1986\nhad been the previous income record for a single quarter.\n    Walbro cited strong demand for its fuel systems products,\nespecially automotive electronic fuel injection components and\ncarburetors for lawn and garden applications.\n    However, it said it is unlikely the company will sustain\nthe same record pace of sales and income throughout 1987, due\nto an expected reduction in throttle body sales.\n    \"It now appears likely that the company's throttle body\nbusiness with General Motors Corp <GM> will peak in the first\nsix months of 1987, continue at reduced levels to July 1988 and\nsuffer an interruption for the period from July 1988 to July\n1989,\" Walbro added.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
