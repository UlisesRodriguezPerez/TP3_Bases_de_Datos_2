        "BODY": "A U.S. Commerce Department spokesman\nsaid the agency would have no comment on Schlumberger Ltd's\nannouncement that it had terminated an agreement in principle\nto sell its Fairchild Semiconductor Corp unit to Fujitsu Ltd.\n    Sclumberger had said that controversy surrounding the\nventure made it unlikely the sale could be completed any time\nsoon. The sale was opposed by Commerce and the U.S. Defense\nDepartment, in part on national security grounds.\n    Commerce chief spokesman B.J. Cooper said the department\nhad had no contact with Schlumberger about the deal.\n    A Defense Department spokesman said the agency was unaware\nof Schlumberger's announcement and would have no immediate\nreaction.\n    Officials last week told Reuters that Commerce Secretary\nMalcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger had\njoined forces to fight the planned sale because it could have\nleft the U.S. military overly dependent on foreign sources for\nvital equipment used in high-technology weapons.\n    Administration opposition to the deal also stemmed from\nongoing trade tensions between the United States and Japan,\nofficials said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
