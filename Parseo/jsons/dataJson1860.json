        "TITLE": "ALLIS-CHALMERS <AH> PROPOSES RESTRUCTURING",
        "DATELINE": "    MILWAUKEE, March 4 - ",
        "BODY": "Allis-Chalmers Corp said it asked\nlenders and other groups to approve a restructuring plan that\nwould cause a dilution of the company's existing common stock.\n    The company said it would sell all of its businesses other\nthan the American Air Filter business, make a public financing\nof more than 100 mln dlrs and pay part of the currently\noutstanding debt with the proceeds.\n    Under the plan, which was presented to institutional\nlenders, the company's unions and the Pension Benefit Guaranty\nCorp, \"substantial amounts\" of institutional debt would be\nconverted to common stock of the restructured company.\n    Allis-Chalmers said it will exchange existing preferred\nstock for common. The exchange of the institutional debt and\npreferred stock for common equity will cause a \"resulting\ndilution of the existing common stock,\" Allis-Chalmers said in\na statement.\n    Under the plan, holders of existing common would hold about\n15 pct of the restructured common stock. Holders of existing\npreferred would hold about 35 pct of the new common.\n    Allis-Chalmers said its only alternative to the plan is\nbankruptcy. The restructuring must be approved by creditors,\ncommon and preferred holders,and present and former employees.\n    Allis-Chalmers said a bankruptcy filing \"appears to\nrepresent the company's only alternative if agreement upon the\nterms of the plan cannot be reached.\"\n    The spokesman said in response to an inquiry that he was\nnot aware of any extraordinary charge against earnings that\nwould result from the restructuring.\n    \"It is too early to talk about a charge\" because the plan\nmust still be approved by the lenders and unions, he said.\n    Also under the plan, payments to Allis-Chalmers' private\nlenders would be deferred. Trade payables and obligations\nincurred in the ordinary course of business will be met.\n    Payment of health benefits for active and retired employees\nwould be made \"at substantially reduced levels.\"\n    Allis-Chalmers, once one of the leading farm equipment\ncompanies, sold all of its farm equipment operations to Deutz\nof West Germany for 107 mln dlrs, leaving the company with\nbusinesses in lift trucks, air conditioning, fluids handling\nand solid materials processing.\n    Last year, Allis-Chalmers sold the lift truck business to\nAC Material Handling Co of Columbus, Ohio.\n    Under the restructuring plan, Allis-Chalmers will sell its\nsolid materials processing and fluids handling businesses.\nSolid materials processing, which makes equipment to crush\nstones for highway construction, accounted for 288 mln dlrs of\nAllis-Chalmers's total 1985 revenues of 886 mln dlrs.\n    The company will also sell its fluids handling operations,\nwhich makes pumps and valves. That business accounted for 196\nmln dlrs of the company's 1985 revenues.\n    Allis-Chalmers in 1986 reported a net loss of 8.6 mln dlrs,\nor 1.09 dlrs a share. In 1985, the company lost 168.4 mln dlrs,\nor 12.27 dlrs a share.\n    The company's last profit was in 1980, when it earned 52.4\nmln dlrs on sales of 2.1 billion dlrs.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003"
