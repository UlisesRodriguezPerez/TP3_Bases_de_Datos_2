        "BODY": "Total supply of frozen concentrated\norange juice (FCOJ) in 1986/87 is expected to be significantly\nabove year-earlier levels, even with carry-in stocks well below\nthe previous season, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.\n    In a summary of its Fruit Situation Report, the Department\nsaid Florida's imports of FCOJ, mostly from Brazil, have shown\nsharp gains to date.\n    The Department noted the price of FCOJ will probably be\naffected by the final decision, scheduled for April 22, on\nwhether the U.S. considers Brazilian FCOJ exports to the U.S.\nhave caused injury.\n    Continuing strong demand for fresh and processing fruit\ncoupled with seasonal declines in supplies mean that grower\nprices will remain higher this spring than a year earlier.\n    The department said stocks of fresh apples in cold storage\nat the beginning of February were moderately larger than a year\nearlier, but strong demand has kept apple prices firm.\n    In view of the strong demand and seasonally reduced\nsupplies, apple prices are projected to stay firm.\n    During the remainder of 1986/87, supplies of most processed\nnoncitrus fruit will be smaller than a year ago, it said.\n    Movement of canned fruit has improved, and remaining\nsuppies for some canned fruit items are tight and as a\nconsequence prices have strengthened, the department said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
