        "BODY": "Guinness Plc <GUIN.L> , the\nbrewing group, has challenged a 5.2 mln stg payment to a U.S.\nLawyer who says he organised its controversial takeover of\nScotch whisky maker <The Distillers Co Plc>.\n    But attorneys for lawyer Thomas Ward, a member of the\nGuinness board, told a court yesterday in the Channel Island of\nJersey that Ward saw the payment as his reward for services in\nlast year's 2.7 billion stg takeover.\n    Britain's Department of Trade and Industry is investigating\nthe takeover.\n    Guinness says its former chairman Ernest Saunders and Ward\n\"breached their fiduciary duty\" in authorising the payment to\nWard, via a Jersey-based company, Marketing and Acquisitions\nConsultants and has gone to the Jersey court to recover it.\n    MAC said in defence documents that Ward was the main\nnegotiator in the battle for Distillers against rival bidder\nArgyll <AYLL.L> Group Plc.\n    \"The bid would not have been successful but for the ...\nServices of Mr Ward,\" MAC attorneys said in the documents\nsubmitted in court. \"The payment was, in all the circumstances,\nreasonable, proper and fully earned.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003"
