        "BODY": "Banks in Hong Kong are likely to raise\nprime rates by half a percentage point to 6-1/2 pct following a\none-quarter point prime rate increase by two major U.S. Banks\nyesterday, dealers said.\n    They told Reuters local banks may decide on the increase at\nthis weekend's routine meeting of the Hong Kong Association of\nBanks.\n    G.C. Goh, chief dealer of the Standard Chartered Bank, said\nprime rate increases by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank to\n7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 may prompt Hong Kong banks to follow suit.\n    Goh said local banks want to restore the prime to 6-1/2\npct, the level at beginning of 1987.\n    The banks raised the prime to the current six pct from five\npct on February 28 after cutting it 1-1/2 points from 6-1/2 on\nJanuary 15 in response to upside pressure on the Hong Kong\ndollar, he said.\n    The medium and longer term interbank rates firmed today,\nwith three months ending at 5-1/16 to 4-7/8 pct against\nyesterday's five to 4-13/16 close. The overnight rate, however,\nfell to 3-1/2 to three pct from 4-1/2 to four because of\nincreased liquidity for a local stock issue.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
