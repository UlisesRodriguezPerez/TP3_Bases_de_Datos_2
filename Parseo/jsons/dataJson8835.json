        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 24 - ",
        "BODY": "A House taxwriter said Energy\nSecretary James Herrington's \"outrageous\" plan to restore an old\ntax break for oil companies was both bad tax and energy policy.\n    Rep. Pete Stark, a California Democrat and senior House\nWays and Means Committee member, said Herrington's plan for a\n27.5 pct depletion allowance--which in effect is a special 27.5\npct tax deduction --would cost seven billion dlrs a year.\n    \"He must have missed the last two years of federal tax\nreform by sleeping as soundly as Rip Van Winkle,\" Stark said.\n    He said in a statement the oil industry already pays an\neffective lower rate of U.S. tax on investment, 15 pct versus\naggregate corporate tax on all investment of 34 pct, according\nto a recent Congressional Research Service study.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
