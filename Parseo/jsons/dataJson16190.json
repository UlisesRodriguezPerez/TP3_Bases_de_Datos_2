        "BODY": "Japanese trade figures are seriously\nchallenging the entrenched view of policy makers of the Group\nof Seven industrialised nations that relative currency rates\nare the key to smoothing world trade problems.\n    Senior Japanese, U.S. And European officials in Tokyo say\nthey are at a loss to fully explain the data, for if currencies\nare the key they ask, why then are are U.S. Exports to Japan\nshrinking?\n    What if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar down\nmade world trade problems worse rather than solving them,\nfulfilling Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's forecast of\nworld trade recession?\n    U.S.-Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollar\nfall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Five\npact in New York.\n    The lower dollar ought to have made U.S. Exports 40 pct\nmore competitive in Japan. The officials, most of them\neconomists, can offer no objective reason why they are not.\n    Worse, how are European Community sales to Japan rising\nrapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declined\nonly 11 pct against the yen.?\n    Last week's G-7 meeting in Washington has been widely\ninterpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollar\nmust go lower. So worst of all, what if Volcker is correct?\n    At a loss to give an objective explanation, officials can\nonly offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective.\n    \"I don't know and I don't think anyone knows,\" said Hugh\nRichardson, acting head of the EC delegation in Tokyo.\n    \"What I do know is that Community exporters are making a\nhell of an effort in this market. If you make an effort, there\nis money to be made in Japan,\" he added.\n    But U.S. Officials and businessmen are convinced low U.S.\nExports to Japan are Japan's fault. They cite restrictive trade\npractices, protected Japanese trade sectors, such as\nagriculture, and non-tariff barriers, such as unreasonable\nchecking and customs procedures for car imports.\n    Publicly, Japanese officials remain conciliatory in the\nface of what they see as U.S. Aggression. In private, they\nblame U.S. Industry for being uncompetitive.\n    \"We see it that way, but we don't like to seem arrogant,\"\nsaid a senior official, who declined to be named. \"We like to\nrefrain from accusing them of not making enough effort.\"\n    Industrialists such as Eishiro Saito, chairman of the\nKeidanren business group, and Sony Corp chairman Akio Morita\nrepeatedly accuse foreign firms of not making enough effort to\nunderstand Japan's markets, and some foreigners agree. \"The real\nissue is the inability of major sectors of American and\nEuropean industry to compete not only internationally but even\nin their home markets,\" Peter Huggler, President of Interallianz\nBank Zurich, told a recent conference in Switzerland.\nREUTER...^M\n\u0003"
