        "DATELINE": "    TAIPEI, April 29 - ",
        "BODY": "Central Bank governor Chang Chi-cheng\ndefended Taiwan's policy of holding a large amount of its\nforeign exchange reserves in U.S. Dollars, citing similar\npolicies followed by countries such as West Germany and Japan.\n    The reserves, now a record 56 billion U.S. Dlrs, are the\nworld's largest after those of West Germany and Japan. About 90\npct is held in U.S. Dollars and the rest in yen and marks.\n    Chang's remarks to parliament were in response to a call on\nMonday by about 20 members of the parliament who asked the\ngovernment to diversify into other currencies, including yen,\nmarks and Swiss francs because of exchange rate losses.\n    The legislators said the bank lost about 3.8 billion U.S.\nDlrs between September 1985 and September 1986 as the Taiwan\ndollar rose to 36.77 to the U.S. Dollar from 40.45.\n    They said they expected the losses to continue because of\nthe rising Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Currency.\n    Chang said the central bank could not sell the U.S. Dollars\nlike other private banks or enterprises because such trading\nwould be speculative and risky.\n    \"The U.S. Dollar is an international currency and is widely\nused among trading nations,\" he added.\n    Chang said the Central Bank has further revised foreign\nexchange rules, which would relax most controls or even suspend\nthem.\n    The revised rules have been submitted to the cabinet for\napproval, he said. He declined to give details.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
