Prior to the\nchange, county prices were also priced against the Amarillo\nmarket.\n    The changes were made to better reflect local market\nconditions, said Ralph Klopfenstein, deputy administrator for\ncommodity operations at USDA.\n    \"The Texas Gulf has always been the dominant market in those\ncounties. Amarillo never became effective for that area,\"\nKlopfenstein told Reuters.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
