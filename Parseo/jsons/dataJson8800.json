        "DATELINE": "    BRUSSELS, March 24 - ",
        "BODY": "Emergency action to distribute\nEuropean Community (EC) food surpluses to the poor has proved\nso successful that the EC executive Commission may propose a\npermanent scheme, a Commission spokesman said.\n    Almost 60,000 tonnes of food was taken out of EC stores\nbetween January 20, when Agriculture Ministers approved the\nscheme, and March 13, according to latest commission figures.\n    The food, including 30,000 tonnes of cereals, 6,000 tonnes\nof sugar, 4,000 tonnes of beef and 13,300 tonnes of butter, has\nbeen distributed to the needy through charities.\n    The present scheme was approved as an emergency measure to\nhelp poor people affected by this year's unusually cold winter\nand will end on March 31.\n    But the spokesman said the commission will consider whether\nto propose it be replaced by an all-year-round system.\n    The commission estimates that up to March 13 the temporary\nscheme cost between 63 and 68 mln European currency units\n(72/78 mln dlrs). This is above the 50 mln Ecu (57 mln dlr)\nceiling originally envisaged by the Ministers.\n    However, commission sources said the real cost was small if\naccount is taken of the expense of keeping food in store until\nits quality and value deteriorates.\n    On the other hand, the impact of the temporary scheme on EC\nfood surpluses has been slight. EC surplus food stocks at\nJanuary 31 included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter, 520,000 tonnes\nof beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
