        "BODY": "(Warrington Inc) said it sold its shoe\ndivisions to Montreal-based (Taurus Footwear Inc) for\nundisclosed terms.\n    The divisions manufacture and distribute Greb, Hush\nPuppies, Kodiak, and Santana brand shoes and had revenues of\nabout 69 mln dlrs last year, Warrington said. It said the sale\nof the shoe divisions and the previous sale of its ski boot\nbusinesses will result in an unspecified net gain.\n    Warrington said it plans to concentrate on its Canstar\nSports Group Inc skate and athletic footwear division, the\nlargest ice skate manufacturer and distributor in the Western\nworld.\n    Warrington said it decided to rationalize the balance of\nits ski businesses, which is expected to result in a divestment\nloss which could outweigh the net gains on the sales of its\nshoe and ski boot divisions.\n    Taurus said the acquisition is expected to increase its\nannual sales to about 100 mln dlrs and make it Canada's largest\nfootwear manufacturer.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
