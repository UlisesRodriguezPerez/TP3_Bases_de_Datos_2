        "BODY": "Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said\nWest Germany would be badly advised to lower interest rates and\nthat he believed the economy would continue to recover after a\nsix-month lull.\n    Asked by the newspaper Bild am Sonntag if lower interest\nrates could boost the domestic economy, Poehl said: \"We would be\nbadly advised if we forced further interest rate cuts.\n    \"This could, under certain circumstances, release new\ninflationary fears which would then be more likely to lead to\nhigher interest rates,\" he added.\n\n    Poehl said Germany had practically no growth in the past\nsix months because of the mark's surge and the cold winter.\n    \"But since April, statistics clearly show that the economy\nfinds itself on a course of growth,\" he said. \"I expect this\ndevelopment to continue in the coming months.\"\n    Asked about his expectations of a U.S.-European Community\ntrade war, Poehl said such an event would be disastrous.\n    \"For this reason we in Europe must avoid everything used by\nprotectionist forces in the U.S. As pretexts,\" he added. \"This\nincludes...Eliminating existing restrictions in the EC as far\nas possible. Protectionism is not found only in the U.S.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
