        "BODY": "The Manitoba Agriculture Department\nweekly crop report said no measurable precipitation was\nreported across the province in the past week, allowing small\ngrain seedings to progress rapidly across the south, with field\npreparation under way in the northern growing regions.\n    Small grains should be seeded across the Province in one to\ntwo weeks, assuming weather remains dry.\n    Planting progress was most advanced in the southeast, with\n30 pct of the spring wheat acres and 40 pct of the barley acres\nseeded. Cereals plantings were well under way in the south\ncentral part of the province, with seedings spotty so far in\nthe southwest.\n    Summer fallow acres should be in line with the latest\nStatistics Canada projections, the report said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
