        "BODY": "The dollar will decline over the next\ntwo to three years, but this is unlikely to result in a\ncomplete reduction of the U.S. current account deficit, said\nAnthony Solomon, chairman of S.G. Warburg (USA) Inc and former\npresident of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n    In a presentation to the Japan Society, Solomon said\nwithout elaboration that he expects a \"significant decline in\nthe dollar,\" within the next three years.\n    \"The dollar will fall more, but the current account deficit\nwill stop being reduced when it reaches its structural core,\"\nhe said.\n    Solomon described the structural core as about one-half of\nthe current 150 billion dlr annual deficit. He cited several\nfactors which will prevent an elimination of the deficit.\n    For one thing, it is unlikely that there will be any new\ninvestment in those manufacturing industries that shrank when\nthe dollar was at uncompetitive levels, he said.\n    In addition, he said that the U.S. has an increased\npropensity to import in order to satisify consumer tastes.\n    Solomon forecast inflation at 4.5 pct by year-end, but said\nit could be kept below five pct in the medium-term if oil\nprices are stable and commodity values remain low.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
