        "BODY": "The Quebec government said it joined\nwith B.F. Goodrich Canada Inc to study the feasability of\nbuilding a vinyl chloride monomer plant in Montreal. The plant\nwould supply manufacturers of PVC construction and other\nmaterials in Eastern Canada and the Northeastern U.S.,\ngovernment officials said.\n    Theys said the  plant would cost about 125 mln Canadian\ndlrs, with production beginning in 1991 if economic conditions\nare right. more\n    The Quebec government has said it wants the project to\nproceed because it would provide future demand for Petromont\nInc petrochemical products. Petromont is jointly owned by Union\nCarbide Canada Ltd <UCC.TO> and the Quebec government's SGF\nindustrial development group. Its Montreal plant would provide\nethylene as a raw material for the project.\n     Quebec said it also wants Interprovincial Pipe Line Ltd\n<IPIPF.O> to adapt its pipeline from Sarnia, Ont., to Montreal\nto carry natural gas liquids, a decision that will be made by\nthe federal National Energy Board. It said the pipeline could\nprovide Petromont with feedstock at one-third the cost of\nmoving it by rail.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
