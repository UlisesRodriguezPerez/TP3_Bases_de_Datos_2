        "BODY": "Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul\nVolcker said current data does not give a clear sign that the\ndeterioration in the U.S. trade balance has yet been reversed.\n    \"The data we have in hand do not provide clearcut evidence\nthat the deterioration in the trade balance has yet been\nreversed,\" Volcker said in remarks prepared for delivery to a\nluncheon for community leaders here.\n    However, Volcker said there are encouraging signs,\nparticularly the rising volume of exports over the past year,\nachieved despite relatively slow growth abroad.\n    Volcker warned it is not sustainable from an economic\nperspective to pile up foreign debt while failing to make the\ninvestment needed to generate growth and earn the money to\nservice the debt.\n    He said the process of restoring external balance to the\nU.S. economy requires dealing with the budget deficit. He said\nneeded economic adjustment will require a relative shift of\nfinancial and real resources into internationally competitive\nindustry. \"More of our growth will need to be reflected in net\nexports and business investment and less in consumption,\"\nVolcker said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
