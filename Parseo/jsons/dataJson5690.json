        "BODY": "Schlumberger Ltd most likely has an\nalternate buyer lined up for its Fairchild Semiconductor unit,\nWall Street analysts said.\n    \"I think its clear that in cancelling its agreement with\nFujitsu, Schlumberger has signaled that it has another deal in\nthe works,\" said Paul Johnson, a semiconductor analyst with\nL.F. Rothschild.\n    \"There are unquestionably other buyers out there,\" added\nKidder Peabody analyst Adam F. Cuhney. \"A lot of companies have\nlooked at Fairchild and would be willing to buy it.\"\n    Among the companies that would be interested in bidding for\nFairchild are Advanced Micro Devices <AMD>, Sunnyvale, Calif.,\nand LSI Logic Corp <LLSI>, Milpitas, Calif., industry analysts\nsaid.\n    Top U.S. chipmakers like National Semiconductor Corp <NSM>,\nTexas Instruments Inc <TXN> and Motorola Inc <MOT> might also\nseek to buy Fairchild, but could possibly run into antitrust\nproblems, the analysts added.\n    Moreover, Fairchild's management is thought to be\nconsidering proposing a leveraged buyout of the Cupertino,\nCalif., company, analysts said.\n    In a brief statement announcing the termination of the\nagreement with Fujitsu, Schlumberger said the decision opened\nup other possibilities, including a possible buyout by\nFairchild management.\n    The company said it ended the deal, in which Fujitsu would\nhave bought 80 pct of Fairchild for an estimated 200 mln dlrs,\nbecause rising opposition to the deal by the Reagan\nadministration made it unlikely that the sale could be\ncompleted within a reasonable period of time.\n    Analysts questioned this explanation, however, arguing that\nthe companies did not need government approval to complete the\ntransaction. Both Schlumberger and Fujitsu are foreigned-owned\ncompanies.\n    \"Schlumberger would not have terminated the deal because\nthe U.S. government didn't want it,\" said Johnson of L.F.\nRothschild.\n    A spokesman for Schlumberger declined to elaborate on the\ncompany's news release.\n    He said only that the company was reviewing a number of\npossible alternatives for the Fairchild unit.\n    Officials at Fairchild and Fujitsu were not immediately\navailable for comment.\n    Analysts noted the significance of the government's\napparent success in preventing Fujitsu from taking control of\nFairchild.\n    Administration officials, including Commerce Secretary\nMalcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger,\nfeared that the sale to Fujitsu would lead to Japanese control\nof key semiconductor technology for supercomputers and military\nweapons systems.\n    \"The government really stood up for the semiconductor\nindustry,\" said Johnson of L.F. Rothschild. \"That, I think, is\nthe real significance of this.\"\n    Consequently, analysts said, the Japanese government might\nnow feel more pressure to address U.S. complaints about\nJapanese chipmakers' violation of the semiconductor trade\nagreement signed last summer.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
