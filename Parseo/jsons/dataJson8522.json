        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, MARCH 23 - ",
        "BODY": "Congress should give the U.S.\nAgriculture Secretary the authority to keep the 1987 soybean\nloan rate at the current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel\nin order to help resolve the problem of soybean export\ncompetitiveness, USDA undersecretary Dan Amstutz said.\n    Speaking to reporters following a Senate Agriculture\nAppropriations hearing, Amstutz suggested that one way out of\nthe current soybean program \"dilemma\" would be for Congress to\nallow the loan rate to remain at 4.56 dlrs. He indicated if the\nloan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider ways to make\nU.S. soybeans more competitive such as using certificates to\nfurther buydown the loan rate.\n    Under current law, the 1987 soybean loan rate cannot be\nless than 4.77 dlrs per bu.\n    Amstutz' suggestion would be for Congress to change the\nfarm bill to allow USDA to leave the soybean loan rate at 4.56\ndlrs in crop year 1987 rather than increase it to 4.77 dlrs.\n    The 1986 effective loan rate is 4.56 dlrs because of the\n4.3 pct Gramm-Rudman budget cut.\n    Amstutz stressed that a major factor in any decision on\nsoybean program changes will be the budget costs.\n    He told the hearing that the problem in soybeans is that\nthe U.S. loan rate provides an \"umbrella\" to foreign production\nand causes competitive problems for U.S. soybeans.\n    Asked about the American Soybean Association's request for\nsome form of income support, Amstutz said \"the competitive\nproblem is the most severe.\" He said USDA is still studying the\nsituation and \"no resolution\" has yet been found.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
