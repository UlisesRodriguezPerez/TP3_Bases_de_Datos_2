        "BODY": "Growth in oil consumption in the Western\nindustrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct\nthis year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International\nEnergy Agency (IEA) said.\n    Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around\none pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels per day, the\nIEA said in its Monthly Oil Market Report.\n    Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from\ntransport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are\nhigher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be\nbelow last year's 3.6 pct, it said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
