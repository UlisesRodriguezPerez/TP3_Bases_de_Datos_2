        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, April 24 - ",
        "BODY": "The most likely reason for West German\nproducers withdrawing white sugar from intervention stores is\nthat they already have, or are reasonably certain of, obtaining\nEuropean Community (EC) export licences for it, traders said.\n    They were responding to EC Commission sources in Brussels\nsaying West German producers have withdrawn most of the 79,250\ntonnes of the sugar they put into intervention on April 1.\n    The traders said it is also likely that French producers,\nwho put over 700,000 tonnes into intervention, will withdraw a\nsignificant proportion of this for the same reason before they\nare due to accept payment for the sugar in early May.\n    Earlier this week traders said the stepping up of the level\nof export licences being granted by the EC at recent tenders,\nwith generous subsidies, had been due to producer threats to\nleave the sugar in intervention and to a desire to move most of\nthe old crop sugar before the new crop tenders start in May.\n    The EC has so far granted licences for 2,467,970 tonnes out\nof around 3.1 mln tonnes targetted for export in the 1986/87\nseries of tenders. This would indicate the likelihood of high\ntonnages continuing to be moved over the next few tenders and\nsubsidies also remaining high in order to attract producer bids\nfor the export licences, traders said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
