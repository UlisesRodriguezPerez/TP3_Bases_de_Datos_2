        "BODY": "Governments of major Asian\nproducing countries have welcomed the conclusion of a new\nInternational Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), but growers and\ntraders are unhappy with the development, according to views\npolled by Reuter correspondents.\n    Officials in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, which\nproduce the bulk of the world's rubber, said they expected the\nnew pact to continue to stabilise prices and help their rubber\nindustries remain viable in the long-term.\n    But traders and growers said they were against the new pact\nbecause its buffer stock mechanism was likely to interefere\nwith free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises.\n    The new INRA, to replace the current one which expires on\nOctober 22, was formally adopted by most of the world's\nproducers and consumers in Geneva last Friday.\n    It will be open for signature at the U.N. Headquarters in\nNew York from May 1 to December 31 this year and will enter\ninto force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting\nfor 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports.\n    Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said\nthe formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears of\nliquidation of some 360,000 tonnes of INRA buffer stock rubber\nand a possible depression of prices.\n    He expressed confidence that the new INRA would continue to\nkeep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices rose\nor fell through its buffer stock system.\n    Malaysia was also happy that in the new INRA financing of\npurchases for the normal buffer stock of 400,000 tonnes and a\ncontingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes would be done\nthrough direct cash contributions from members, he said.\n    Under the existing pact, members can borrow from banks to\nfinance INRA's buffer stock purchases. This has been viewed\nwith concern by some members who fear the INRA may become\nindebted and ultimately face collapse, like the International\nTin Agreement.\n    \"This will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried out\nwithout any financial encumbrance,\" Lim said.\n     Malaysia, the world's largest producer, was seeking\ncabinet approval to join the new INRA and hoped other producers\nand consumers would also become members, he said.\n    Officials in Jakarta said the new pact would bring benefit\nto Indonesia's rubber industry's by stabilising prices.\n    It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because\nits new financial provisions had been tightened, they said.\n    Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the new\npact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt\nthe INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his market\noperations.\n     Malaysian growers, however, said they preferred a free\nrubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices at\nlevels that were only acceptable to consumers.\n    \"With the INRA's ability to keep prices at a certain stable\nlevel, consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price,\nwhile producers may never see sharp price rises,\" a Malaysian\nRubber Producers Council source told Reuters.\n    Producers also wanted a free rubber market without the\noverhang of a 360,000 tonne INRA buffer stock which had\npsychologically prevented price rises, he said.\n    State plantation officials in Sri Lanka said prices had\nbeen depressed since INRA's inception and the creation of a\nbuffer stock, and they seemed unlikely to rise.\n    Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it was\nexpensive to maintain a buffer stock, they added.\n    Traders in the region, meanwhile, said prices might be\npressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to\nstabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers\nto produce more.\n    Most Malaysian and Singapore traders said the new pact's\nconclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely to\nallow sharp price fluctuations in future.\n    \"The 360,000 tonnes in the INRA buffer stock must be\nliquidated and a free market returned,\" a Malaysian trader said.\n    Japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for success\nas most world producers and consumers had adopted it, but they\nquestioned the ability of some financially-strapped producers\nto finance buffer stock operations.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
