        "TITLE": "U.S. CORN MARKET SKEWED BY SOVIET BUYING",
        "AUTHOR": "    By Andrew Stern, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    CHICAGO, March 18 - ",
        "BODY": "Recent purchases of U.S. corn by the\nSoviet Union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasing\nthe price difference between the premium price paid at the Gulf\nexport point and interior levels, cash grain dealers said.\n    Many dealers expect the USDA will act soon to reduce the\ncash price premium at the Gulf versus the interior -- which a\ndealer in Davenport, Iowa, said was roughly 20 pct wider than\nnormal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel -- by making\nit worthwhile for farmers to move grain.\n    By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn, the USDA\ncould encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales,\nwhere PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the\ngovernment price support loan program and then marketed.\n    If the USDA acts soon, as many dealers expect, the movement\nwould break the Gulf corn basis.\n    \"The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine county\nposted prices,\" one dealer said. \"It should be taking the\naverage of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City,\" which\nwould more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior\nMidwest.\n    \"But we don't know when they might do it,\" an Ohio dealer\nsaid, which has created uncertainty in the market.\n    The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effort\nto free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited to\nthe government and remain off the market and in storage.\n    Yesterday, USDA issued a report showing that only slightly\nmore than 50 pct of the 3.85 billion dlrs in PIK certificates\nit has issued to farmers (in lieu of cash payments) had to date\nbeen exchanged for grain.\n    With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIK\ncertificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months, the\nUSDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grain\nby adjusting the ASCS prices, cash grain dealers said.\n    A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise in\nbarge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwest\nto the export terminals, cash dealers said.\n    Freight from upper areas of the Mississippi have risen\nnearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of the\noriginal tariff price. The mild winter and early reopening of\nthe mid-Mississippi river this spring have also encouraged the\nfirmer trend in barge freight, dealers noted.\n    The higher transportation costs have served to depress\ninterior corn basis levels, squeezing the margins obtained by\nthe elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well as\ndiscouraging farmer marketings, they said.\n    \"The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports,\"\nwhich indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as much\nas 4.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, one Midwest cash grain trader\nsaid.\n    But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside,\nfreight rates will settle back down because of the overall\nsurplus of barges on the Midwest river system.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
