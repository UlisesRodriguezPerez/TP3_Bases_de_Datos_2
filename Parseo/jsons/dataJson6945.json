        "BODY": "Former Prime Minister Robert\nMuldoon, an outspoken advocate of a managed float for the N.Z.\nDollar, said the currency is at least 10 pct overvalued.\n    Muldoon said in a speech last night the exchange rate\nshould be around 48 U.S. Cents instead of the current 57 cents.\n    \"A reasonable value for the New Zealand dollar would be\nbetween 10 and 15 pct less and nearer 15 than 10. Perhaps\naround about 48 cents,\" he said.\n    The Labour Party government removed exchange controls and\nfloated the dollar two years ago when it was worth 44 cents.\n    Muldoon has no rank in the opposition National Party, and\nparty leaders, with an eye to general elections to be held by\nSeptember, have rejected his calls for a managed float.\n    He said the dollar was high because of \"grossly excessive\"\ninterest rates for government stock.\n    \"I know of no other country which is implementing such a\nfree floating policy,\" he added. \"There is widespread agreement\ninternationally that we have no alternative to floating\ncurrencies in the short to medium term. But we need more\neffective methods of managing them so as to limit the\nvolatility which has caused so much concern and damage.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003"
