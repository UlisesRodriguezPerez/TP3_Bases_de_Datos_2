        "DATELINE": "     WASHINGTON, April 1 - ",
        "BODY": "Conrac Corp, whose board has\nrejected a 25 dlr a share tender offer from Mark IV Industries\nInc <IV>, said it is exploring alternatives such as a\nrestructuring, leveraged buyout or takeover of the company.\n     In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,\nConrac said its board of directors authorized its financial and\nlegal advisors to explore a several alternatives to the Mark IV\noffer, which it said it considers inadequate.\n    The alternatives being explored include a restructuring,\nleveraged buyout or a takeover of the company by another\ncompany, Conrac said.\n    Conrac, which said its board discussed the alternatives at\nspecial meetings on March 26 and 30, said that its decision on\nwhether to adopt any of the alternatives would hinge on \"the\nfuture actions of Mark IV\" and its unsolicitied tender offer.\n    Putting into effect any of the alternatives being explored\ncould hurt or defeat the Mark IV offer, it said.\n    Board members were also instructed to keep confidential the\nterms of any transaction that might be entered into until it\nbecomes final, the company said.\n    The board also took other defensive steps, including\ngranting severance agreements to some officers, it said.\n    At a board meeting yesterday, Concac's directors deleted a\nprovision allowing the holder of at least one-third of of all\nclasses of its voting stock to call a special shareholders\nmeeting and deleted another provision allowing shareholders to\nremove directors without cause, the company said.\n    The defensive moves were taken because Mark IV had said it\nplanned to elect a majority of its designees as directors at a\nspecial holders meeting if it succeeded in acquring a majority\nof the company's common stock in the offer, Conrac said.\n    Conrac's president, vice president and treasurer were given\nseverance agreements, or \"golden parachutes,\" it said.\n    Under the agreements, Conrac President Paul Graf would get\na cash payment of twice his annual salary, which was 209,906\ndlrs last year, if there were a change of control in the\ncompany, including acquisition of 30 pct or more of the\ncompany's voting stock, Conrac said.\n    Treasurer Joseph Smorada and Vice President Joseph\nO'Donnell, who made 143,325 dlrs last year, would get\none-and-a-half times his salary if there were a change in\ncontrol. Smorada's salary was not listed in the SEC filing.\n    The executives would also get cash settlements of options\nplans and continuation of insurance and other benefits.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
