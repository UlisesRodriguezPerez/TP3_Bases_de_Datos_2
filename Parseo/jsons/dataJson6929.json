        "BODY": "Mondanto Co said it has paid off\ntwo-thirds of the debt from its 2.8 billion-dlr acquisition of\nG.D. Searle and Co by the end of 1986.\n    This lowered the company's debt-to-capitalization ratio\nfrom 45 pct at the end of 1985 to 35 pct, it said.\n    The company also said that chemical sales accounted for 52\npct of its sales in 1986, down from 70 pct in 1981. This\nunderscores its strategy of shifting away from low profit\ncommodity chemicals in mature markets into higher value\nchemical businesses in high growth areas, it said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
