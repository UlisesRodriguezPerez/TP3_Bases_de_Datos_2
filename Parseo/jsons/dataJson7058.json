        "BODY": "Transamerica Corp said it expects\nto realize a gain of about 75 mln dlrs on the\npreviously-announced sale of the group life and health\noperations of its Transamerican Occidental Life Insurance Co\nsubsidiary to Provident Life and Accident Co <PACC>.\n    But it said its Transamerica Life Cos unit plans to change\nto a more conservative method of amortizing deferred policy\nacquisition costs, resulting in a one-time charge that will\noffset most of the gain from the sale.\n    Transamerica said it has now signed a definitive agreement\nfor the sale, which will be structured as a reinsurance\ntransaction involving about 400 mln dlrs of reserve\nliabilities.\n    It said the 75 mln dlr gain from the sale and about 125 mln\ndlrs of statutory surplus that previously supported operations\nof the group being sold will be used to support Transamerica\nLife Cos' efforts to accelerate the growth of its remaining\nbusinesses.  It said closing is expected by May One, subject to\nregulatory approvals.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
