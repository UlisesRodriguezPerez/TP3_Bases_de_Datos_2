        "TITLE": "WORLD BANK SUGGESTS MORE OPEN ECONOMY FOR INDIA",

        "DATELINE": "    NEW DELHI, April 21 - ",
        "BODY": "The World Bank has suggested India\nshould move to a more open economy by gradually removing most\ngovernment controls on industry and adopting a liberal external\ntrade policy with reduced levels of protection.\n    A confidential \"executive summary\" of a draft Bank report on\nthe Indian economy was made available to Reuters. It suggests\nliberalisation as part of a package of reforms to boost exports\nof Indian goods by making them more competitive.\n    The summary said, \"These reforms would result in (domestic)\nprices much more in line with world prices than is true today,\nand in a greater degree of import competition and export\nrivalry than the nation has ever seen.\"\n    The summary said foreign trade must play a key role in\nIndia's transition towards a more dynamic economy. Liberal\nimports of capital goods would help modernise the economy and\nexpose Indian producers to foreign competition. Larger exports\nwould provide the foreign exchange for imports.\n    \"The main guideline is unambiguously to abandon the present\nprinciple of unlimited protection for all indigenously\navailable products and to recognise the role of actual or\npotential competition from imports as a source of discipline on\nthe prices and costs of public and private sector domestic\nmanufacturers,\" the summary said.\n    An Indian official told Reuters the government was\ndiscussing the report with the Bank. A final report with some\nchanges was likely to be ready by May, but he declined to give\nfurther details.\n    The Bank and industrialised nations will discuss the Bank's\nfinal report at a meeting in Paris on June 22 and 23 to discuss\naid for India in the 1987/88 year starting in June.\n    The summary said India's gross domestic product (gdp) grew\nat an average five pct in Indian fiscal years 1985/86 and\n1986/87, which ended in March.\n    It said investment was being sustained at nearly 25 pct of\ngdp. Almost 94 pct of the investment was being financed by\nnational savings, mainly from the private sector.\n    India's trade deficit is officially said to have narrowed\nto 5.6 billion dlrs in 1986/87 ended March, from a record 6.96\nbillion dlrs in 1985/86. The current account deficit fell to\n2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87 from 2.88 billion in 1985/86.\n    But the summary said the improvement was largely due to\nlower prices of crude oil, petroleum products and fertilisers\nwhich make up the bulk of India's import bill.\n    India was able to save about 2.6 billion dlrs in foreign\nexchange in 1986/87 due to lower prices of those products, the\nsummary said.\n    The Bank's summary said there was little room for\ncomplacency in the balance of payments position.\n    It said that despite a lower trade deficit in 1986/87,\nIndian foreign exchange reserves fell by 240 mln dlrs.\n    Real export growth would need to average at least 6.1 pct a\nyear in value terms in the coming years to maintain a viable\nbalance of payments, the summary said.\n    It did not explicitly suggest the rupee should be devalued.\nIndia \"might have to reaffirm the commitment to exporting while\nundertaking some dramatic changes in general incentives that\ninvolve some political costs,\" it said.\n    \"An example of such a policy would be the adoption of an\nexchange rate regime that maintained exporters' profitability,\"\nthe summary said.\n    It said such an approach had been successful in countries\nsuch as South Korea, Colombia and Turkey. It would maintain the\ncompetitiveness of Indian exports and simultaneously reduce\nimport pressures.\n    Earlier this year, the Indian government denied that the\nWorld Bank asked it to devalue the Indian rupee to boost\nexports.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
