        "BODY": "Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige\nsaid he supported efforts to persuade newly-industrialized\ncountries (NICS) to revalue currencies that are tied to the\ndollar in order to help the United States cut its massive trade\ndeficit.\n    \"We do need to do something with those currencies or we\nwill be substituting Japanese products for Taiwanese products,\"\nor those of other nations with currencies tied to the dollar,\nBaldrige told a House banking subcommittee.\n    The U.S. dollar has declined in value against the Yen and\nEuropean currencies, but has changed very little against the\ncurrencies of some developing countries such as South Korea and\nTaiwan because they are linked to the value of the dollar.\n    As a result, efforts to reduce the value of the dollar over\nthe past year and a half have done little to improve the trade\ndeficits with those countries.\n    Baldrige told a House Banking subcommittee that the\nTreasury Department was attempting to persuade those countries\nto reach agreement with the United States on exchange rates.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003"
