        "BODY": "The maximum export rebate granted at\nyesterday's EC sugar tender marked no change in policy over\nproducer complaints that they are not obtaining the EC\nintervention price in exporting sugar outside the Community, EC\nCommission sources said.\n    The maximum rebate was 46.496 Ecus per 100 kilos for\n118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 Ecus the previous\nweek, but the change is explained by world market conditions.\n    Producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed to\nobtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over one\nEcu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week,\nthe sources said.\n    They said this was despite the fact that the Commission had\nto accept 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention from\noperators protesting that rebates are too low.\n    Operators have now until early May to withdraw this sugar.\nBut they have not given any sign of planned withdrawals unless\nthe Commission reviews its export policy, they said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
