        "DATELINE": "    SYDNEY, March 31 - ",
        "BODY": "CSR Ltd <CSRA.S> said it will offer 2.20\ndlrs cash each for the shares it does not already hold in\n<Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd>.\n    CSR already holds 31.74 pct of Pioneer's 99.80 mln issued\nshares, it said in a statement.\n    The offer price values the entire Pioneer Sugar share\ncapital at 219.6 mln dlrs and compares with today's closing\nmarket level of 1.85 dlrs a share.\n    CSR said it will announce further details of the offer\nsoon, including an alternative offer of CSR shares for Pioneer\nSugar stock.\n    It said the offer is generous since it will give Pioneer\nSugar shareholders a price equivalent to 29 times Pioneer's net\nearnings last financial year and a premium of 22 pct over\nyesterday's market price which CSR said it believed already\ncontained an element of takeover speculation.\n    It also gives a premium of 91 pct over Pioneer's last\nreported net tangible assets per share, CSR said.\n    CSR said the generous offer price reflects the cost savings\nwhich will flow from integrated management of CSR's and\nPioneer's raw sugar mills and building materials businesses.\n    These economies can only be achieved through CSR control\nand management of Pioneer Sugar, it added.\n    The takeover announcement came soon after CSR's earlier\nreported statement that it will sell its <Delhi Petroleum Pty\nLtd> unit to an Exxon Corp <XON> unit for 985 mln dlrs and not\nproceed with the previously announced float of part of Delhi.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
