        "BODY": "Woolworths Ltd <WLWA.S> said policy,\nmanagement and financial changes initiated during the 1986/87\nbusiness year should cause profits to reach more acceptable\nlevels in 1987/88 end-February 1.\n    Net profit reported earlier fell 85.3 pct in the year ended\nFebruary 1.\n    Results for the first month of the new year were\nencouraging after a period of uncertain consumer confidence and\ndifficult trading conditions, it said in a statement.\n    The Big W discount store division and New South Wales\nsupermarkets produced very disappointing results, it added.\n    Woolworths earlier reported a fall in net profit to 9.27\nmln from 63.20 mln on sales of 5.47 billion against 4.83\nbillion. Capital spending for the year was 119 mln dlrs against\n105 mln for the previous year with 50 new stores opened, but\ntotal sales were below target, Woolworths said.\n    The company provided 20 mln dlrs against operating profit\nfor the year to cover mark-downs on stock.\n    Extraordinary items included a 53 mln dlr profit on the\nsale of properties and investments less a 28 mln provision for\nreorganising the Big W chain.\n    Woolworths is unrelated to the U.S. Group F.W. Woolworth\n<Z.N>. It has been the subject of takeover speculation since\n<Industrial Equity Ltd> acquired a 20 pct stake last year.\n    New Zealand's diversified investment group <Rainbow Corp\nLtd> bought Safeway Stores Inc's <SA> 20 pct holding in\nWoolworths for 190 mln dlrs late last year.\n    Safeway put its stake up for tender just in time to take\nadvantage of changes in U.S. Tax laws effective from the end of\nDecember, informed sources said.\n    Woolworths shares closed on Australian stock exchanges\ntoday at 3.50 dlrs, down five cents from Friday.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
