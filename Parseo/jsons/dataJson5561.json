        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 16 - ",
        "BODY": "U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a\nshowdown between protectionists and free traders as a major\ntrade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the\nfull House of Representatives in late April.\n    In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key\nHouse subcommittee last week approved a toned-down version of\nlegislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against\nforeign countries that follow unfair trade practices.\n    The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts\nto restore competitiveness of American industries and turn\naround last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit.\n    Generally, the bill's provisions toughen U.S. enforcement\nof trade laws.\n    The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly on\ncomplaints of unfair trade practices, such as dumping products\nin the United States at prices below cost of production. It\nalso forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry\ncomplains that a surge in imports threatens its existence.\n    In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for\ntrade relief for specific industries such as textiles.\n    Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too\nmany concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back\namendments to \"get tough\" with countries that violate trade\nagreements or keep out U.S. products.\n    But congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade\nsaid the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputes\nand they will seek to restore his negotiating powers.\n    Bill Frenzel, R-MI., said the subcommittee's bill was not\none \"that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,\"\nbut he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to work\ntoward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse.\n    The goal of trade legislation was \"to make our trade policy\nstronger without violating our international trade agreements,\"\nhe said.\n    In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and Means\nCommittee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-IL., the trade\nsubcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced\nReagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on imports\nfrom countries that engage in unfair trade practices.\n    It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation if\nit would hurt the U.S. economy.\n    Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach was\nnecessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign\ninto law.\n    Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a tough\nHouse trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year he\nonly reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw\nDemocratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation.\n    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters late\nlast week that the administration still did not like some of\nthe bill's provisions, but he added, \"Generally we feel very\ngood about the bipartisan consideration of the trade\nlegislation. I think we are progressing very well.\"\n    The first battle will take place next week when the full\nHouse Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.\nRichard Gephardt, D-MO., to force countries like Japan, South\nKorea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S.\n    The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only\nthat the existence of a large trade surplus with the United\nStates will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,\nbut would not automatically set off retaliation.\n    Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from\nimports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition.\n    AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the\nadministration when he said any trade bill Reagan would sign\nwould not be worth passage in Congress.\n    But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate by\nsaying, \"I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane\nKirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed\nby the president.\"\n    Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-GA.) intends to push separately a bill\nto protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide\nsaid. Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year.\n    House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, one of the most\ninfluential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by\nlow-priced foreign competition, last week renewed his call for\nimport relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his\nsupport for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import\ntariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
