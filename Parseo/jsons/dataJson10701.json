        "BODY": "Japanese feed and starch makers actively\nbought U.S. Corn last week, C and F basis, for July/September\nshipment in view of bullish freight rates following active\ninquiries by the Soviet Union, trade sources said.\n    Some said the makers were seen buying some 30 pct of their\nrequirements, estimated at about three mln tonnes for the\nthree-month shipment period.\n    \"Belief is growing that freight rates will not decline\nsharply from current high levels even in the usually sluggish\nsummer season because the Soviet Union's chartering is seen\ncontinuing five to seven months from April,\" one source said.\n    The sources said Japanese trading houses were seen covering\na total of 500,000 tonnes of Chinese corn for shipment in May\nto October. But they are believed to have not yet sold most of\nthe corn to end-users in anticipation of further corn price\nrises in the world market.\n    Supply from Argentina and South Africa for July/September\nis still uncertain. But the sources forecast supplies from\nArgentina may fall to 400,000 to 500,000 tonnes from an\nanticipated 800,000 in calendar 1987 and from South Africa to\n700,000 to 800,000 tonnes from an estimated one mln in light of\ntighter export availability.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
