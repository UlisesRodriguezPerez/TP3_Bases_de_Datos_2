        "BODY": "Analyst Thomas McCrann of Merrill\nLynch said he reiterated a \"buy\" recommendation of Wang\nLaboratories Inc, noting that a successful cost cutting\ncampaign could reduce the earnings loss expected for the third\nquarter ending in March.\n    Wang was the most actively traded stock on the American\nStock Exchange, rising 3/4 to 16-5/8.\n    McCrann said that \"Wang is a little bit ahead of where they\nwere expected to be in their cost reductions, and as a result,\nthe odds have increased that the loss for the quarter will be\nless than had been expected.\"\n    McCrann said he expects Wang to report break even earnings\nper share or only a small loss per share for the third quarter.\n    He said for the year, however, the company should report a\nloss of about 50 cts a share compared with earnings of about 35\ncts a share a year ago.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
