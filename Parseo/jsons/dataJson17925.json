        "BODY": "Kuwait, a target of Iranian anger over the\nemirate's backing for Iraq in the Gulf war, today rejected\ncharges that fishing vessels seized recently by Iran were spy\nboats.\n    \"There are no bases of truth to the contents of the Iranian\naccusation on the nature of the operations of the vessels\nrecently taken into custody by Iran. These vessels were out\nfishing,\" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\n    It said Iranian Charge d'Affaires Mohammad Baqeri was\nsummoned by the Ministry yesterday to confer with Foreign\nUndersecretary Suleiman Majed al-Shaheen.\n    The Iranian News Agency IRNA said on Sunday Iran had seized\nseven Kuwaiti speed boats and detained their crew, who\nconfessed to spying for Iraq under the cover of fishing.\n    It said the boats were intercepted in the Khur Abdullah\nwaterway which separates Kuwait and Iraq's Faw peninsula at the\nhead of the Gulf, captured by Iran last year.\n    The Kuwaiti response came as Iranian envoys toured Gulf\nArab states saying responsibility for security and stability in\nthe waterway was a regional matter. A U.S. Senate team was\nscheduled today to meet Kuwait's Crown Prince and Prime\nMinister Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah and the defence and\noil ministers.\n    Today's Foreign Ministry statement, carried by the Kuwait\nNews Agency KUNA, said the recent detention of Kuwaiti fishing\nvessels by Iran was not the first.\n    Tehran in the past had held back a number of vessels Kuwait\nhad sought to release through diplomatic contacts, it said.\n    \"However, Kuwait is perplexed that this time the Iranian\ncharges are accompanied by accusations that the vessels were\nundertaking espionage activities,\" it said.\n    Shaheen condemned the detentions and accusations, and asked\nTehran to free all fishing boats and sailors held by Iran, the\nstatement said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
