        "BODY": "American lawmakers rallied behind\nPresident Reagan for the U.S. strike against Iranian targets in\nthe Gulf but the attack fueled a sharp new White House-Congress\ndebate over limits on his powers to make war.\n    The Pentagon announced on Monday that U.S. warships\ndestroyed a non-producing oil platform used for monitoring Gulf\nship traffic and military operations, and also raided a second\nIranian oil rig in retaliation for an earlier Iranian attack on\na Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag.\n    Many Democrats, who control Congress, and Republicans\nexpressed support for the attack and praised it as an\nappropriate \"measured response.\"\n    But Democrats and liberal Republicans voiced new fears that\nthe growing confrontation between Tehran and the United States\ncould erupt into a major war, and demanded that Reagan comply\nwith the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead to a pullout of\nAmerican forces from the waterway.\n    \"Those who contend the strike was necessary must realize\ntheir words are easily construed as a tacit endorsement of war\nwith Iran,\" said Sen Mark Hatfield of Oregon, a Republican.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
