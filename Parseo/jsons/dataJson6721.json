        "BODY": "CPC International Inc said it expects\n1987 earnings per share to increase over 1986 levels.\n    \"We are confident that 1987 will top 1986 in earnings per\nshare and are optimistic about our longer-term future as well,\"\nthe company said in its 1986 annual report.\n    In 1986, CPC earned 219.2 mln dlrs, or 2.30 dlrs a share,\non revenues of 4.55 billion dlrs compared with income of 142\nmln dlrs or 1.46 dlrs on sales of 4.21 billion dlrs in 1985.\nThe share figures are adjusted for a 2-for-1 split paid in\nJanuary.\n    A share buyback program started last year reduced the\nnumber of shares outstanding to 82.6 mln at year-end 1986 from\n97.2 mln dlrs the end of 1985, adjusted for the split.\n    The food and grocery products company also said it was the\nsubject of five stockholder lawsuits and one class action suit,\nfiled last November and December in Delaware, New York and New\nJersey.\n    The suits are related to the company's purchase of its\nshares from Salomon Brothers Inc after Salomon bought a block\nof the stock from Ronald Perelman, who had acquired nearly 3.7\nmln CPC shares, or 7.6 pct of the company, last year.\n    The suits allege the company bought the shares back at an\nartificially inflated price, violating securities laws,\nbreaching directors' fiduciary duties and wasting corporate\nassets.\n    CPC said the defendants, which include the company, its\ndirectors, Salomon and Perelman, deny all the allegations of\nimproper conduct and are defending the suits.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
