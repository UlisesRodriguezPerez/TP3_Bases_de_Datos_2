        "BODY": "A 50 pct cut in the import tariff for\nsoybeans should help boost 1987 U.S. Soybean exports to Taiwan,\na spokesman for the joint committee of soybean importers told\nReuters.\n    He said the cut to 3.5 from seven pct was approved by the\ncabinet yesterday and would go into effect within a week.\n    The cut will encourage local importers to increase 1987\nsoybean imports to 1.9 mln tonnes from 1.74 mln last year, he\nsaid. The previous target for 1987 was 1.81 tonnes.\n    Taiwan imports more than 90 pct of its soybeans from the\nU.S. And the rest from South America.\n    The spokesman said the increase in imports from the U.S. Is\nin line with government efforts to reduce Taiwan's trade\nsurplus with Washington, which rose to 3.61 billion U.S. Dlrs\nin the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year ago.\n    \"The tariff cut is very helpful for American suppliers (who\nwant) to boost their exports to Taiwan,\" Steve Chen, country\ndirector of the American Soybean Association, told Reuters.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
