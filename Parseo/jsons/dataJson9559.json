        "BODY": "International Cocoa Organization, ICCO,\nCouncil chairman, Denis Bra Kanon, said he will attempt to\nreach a compromise on buffer stock rules for the International\nCocoa Agreement.\n    Bra Kanon called for bilateral consultations among\nproducers and consumers Thursday morning to resolve outstanding\ndifferences on how much non-member cocoa the buffer stock can\npurchase and differentials to be fixed for different origin\ncocoa, consumer delegates told reporters.\n    Bra Kanon is expected to meet with about eight delegations\nindividually in attempt to iron out remaining problems.\n    Producers and consumers indicated support \"in principle\" for\nthe draft buffer stock rules package formulated over the past\nweek by a small working group, consumer delegates said.\n    Despite remaining differences delegates remained confident\na buffer stock accord would be agreed to by Friday when the\ncouncil session ends, but certain technical points need further\nclarification, the delegates said.\n    Certain consumers are concerned that differentials included\nin the draft buffer stock package are out of line with market\nrealities, consumer delegates said.\n    Unless these are modified there are fears it would promote\npurchases of quality cocoas, such as Ghana origin, which are\nnormally required by manufacturers, they said.\n    Restrictions on buffer stock purchases of non-member cocoa\nmight lead to a supply overhang in Malaysian cocoa, which would\ndepress prices, they added.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
