        "BODY": "Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said he\nhopes his visit to Washington later this week will help resolve\nJapan's severe trade problems with the United States.\n    Nakasone leaves on his sixth official visit to the United\nStates on Wednesday, only weeks after President Reagan imposed\npunitive tariffs of 300 mln dlrs a year on Japanese electronic\ngoods for alleged violation of a semiconductor pact.\n    Japan also faces more possible sanctions amid calls in the\nU.S. Congress for further action to help improve trade\nimbalances.\n    Japan's trade surplus with the United States reached a\nrecord 58.6 billion dlrs in 1986.\n    Nakasone told reporters that special envoy Shintaro Abe,\nwho has just returned from Washington, told him protectionist\nsentiment in the United States is severe.\n    \"We are well aware of a movement in the United States to\nenact legislation,\" Nakasone said.\n    He said friends at home and abroad have advised him not to\ngo to the United States but it is now more important than ever\nthat he express Japan's view and carefully listens to the views\nof the United States.\n    \"My visit to the United States at this time will be the most\nimportant visit of all,\" Nakasone said.\n    While in Washington, he said he hopes to have candid and\nfrank discussions with President Reagan and Congressionl\nleaders. He said he plans to discuss exchange rate stability,\neconomic cooperation to developing countries and U.S.-Soviet\ndisarmament and arms control.\n    On the recently imposed trade sactions, Nakasone said he\nwould present evidence that Japanese semiconductor imports are\nincreasing and that Japan is monitoring exports to third\ncountries.\n    \"We have full confidence we can present clear evidence,\" he\nsaid. \"(Therefore), we will request that the sanctions be lifted\nat the earliest possible time.\"\n    On the trade imbalance, Nakasone said Japan has already\ntaken action. The volume of exports to the United States has\nbeen cut, while U.S. Imports have increased.\n    But Japanese imports from Europe and other Asian nations\nhave recently surged, those from the United States remain weak,\nindicating a lack of U.S. Competitiveness, he said.\n    Nakasone said Japan will continue to strive to improve the\ntrade imbalance but the United States will have to become more\ncompetitive and improve its huge budget deficit.\n    He said he will also discuss the forthcoming Venice summit\nof the seven major industrial nations in June.\n    \"We can further enhance the efforts for improving peace,\ndisarmament and the world economies as a whole through\nsolidarity,\" Nakasone said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
