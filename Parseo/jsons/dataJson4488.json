It is not in the best interests\nof the country to have more of the micro-electronics business\nleaving the United States,\" one of the Pentagon officials, who\nasked not to be identified, told Reuters.\n    Commerce Department officials told Reuters yesterday that\nBaldrige opposed the planned sale and that the White House\nEconomic Policy Council will take up the matter within weeks.\n    Commerce and defense officials said Baldrige and Weinberger\nfeared the U.S. military is already leaning too heavily on\nforeign electronic support.\n    But the Defense Department also said today that Weinberger\nand Baldrige differed on the proposed sale of U.S. computer\nequipment to Iran.\n    The Commerce Department advised the Pentagon recently that\ndefense objections to two proposed sales -- to an Iranian power\ncompany and the Islamic Republic of Iran News Agency -- were\nnot valid and the sales of small and medium computers would go\nthrough unless more evidence was presented.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
