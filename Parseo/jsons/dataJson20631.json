        "BODY": "Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said he\nwas surprised by recent criticism of West German economic\npolicies voiced by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker but\nadded that the criticism was not purely one-sided.\n    Stoltenberg told the West German Trade and Industry\nAssociation (DIHT) that before a meeting with Baker on Monday,\n\"There had been surprising notes of criticism (from the United\nStates).\" He added. \"Criticism is not a one-way street.\"\n    He did not elaborate, but Bonn has often called on the U.S.\nTo reduce its federal budget deficit.\n    Over the weekend Baker had criticised West German economic\npolicies, saying that rises in domestic interest rates here\nwere not in the spirit of last February's Louvre pact to\nstabilise currencies.\n    Stoltenberg told the DIHT that his meeting on Monday with\nBaker had resolved differences between the two countries.\n    At a news conference earlier on Tuesday Stoltenberg had\ndeclined to comment specifically on Baker's criticisms, but he\nhad said that after three hours of discussions on Monday, \"one\nremark or another has been clarified.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
