        "TITLE": "ENERGY/U.S. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY",
        "AUTHOR": "    By JULIE VORMAN, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    HOUSTON, April 8 - ",
        "BODY": "Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.\ndollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will\npropel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record\nprofits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,\nmajor company executives predicted.\n    This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an\nindustrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF\nCorp <GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms\nto aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.\n    Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc <ASH>, the\nKentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for\nmoney-making petrochemical businesses to buy.\n    \"I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,\" said\nPaul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co <DOW>, adding,\n\"There's no major plant capacity being added around the world\nnow. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving\nthe old ones.\"\n    Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,\nautomobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of\npaints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.\n    U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about\n90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike\nproduct prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,\nmanaging director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand\nfor some products such as styrene could push profit margins up\nby as much as 300 pct, he said.\n    Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in\nHouston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned\nlast year and predicted it would have the best year in its\nhistory.\n    In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel\nand chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.\ndollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. \"I believe the entire\nchemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,\"\nOreffice said.\n    GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical\nindustry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.\nLast year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion\ndlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.\n    The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical\nindustry has been brought about by a combination of luck and\nplanning, said Pace's John Dosher.\n    Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks\ndramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar\nwas weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost\nU.S. chemical exports.\n    Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has\nbeen the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical\nmanufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers\nin the early 1980s.\n    Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers\nhave embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program\nto mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate\nunrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of\nfriendly and hostile takeover attempts.\n    GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire\nUnion Carbide Corp <UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs\nfor Borg Warner Corp <BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics\nand chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace <GRA> \nhas divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer\nbusinesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.\n    But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be\nheaded for trouble if companies continue turning their back on\nthe manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as\nethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that\nare custom-designed for a small group of buyers.\n    \"Companies like DuPont <DD> and Monsanto Co <MTC> spent the\npast two or three years trying to get out of the commodity\nchemical business in reaction to how badly the market had\ndeteriorated,\" Dosher said. \"But I think they will eventually\nkill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche\nmarket.\" Some top chemical executives share the concern.\n    \"The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting\ncarried away and repeating past mistakes,\" GAF's Heyman\ncautioned. \"The shift from commodity chemicals may be\nill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.\"\n    Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the\nSterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700\nmln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.\n    Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout\nof Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1\nbillion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants\nalong the Texas Gulf Coast.\n    The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that\nare the building blocks of specialty products.\n    \"This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a\nglamorous, high-margin business,\" Cain said, adding that demand\nis expected to grow by about three pct annually.\n    Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said\nchemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for\nplastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood\nand steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical\nbusiness could last as long as four or five years, provided the\nU.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
