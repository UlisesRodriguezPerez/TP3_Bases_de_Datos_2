        "DATELINE": "    HAVANA, April 7 - ",
        "BODY": "Cuban president Fidel Castro told a\nCongress of the Union of Young Communists here that the\nproduction of crude sugar during the harvest still in progress\nis 800,000 tonnes behind schedule.\n    In a speech Sunday, published in today's official paper\nGRANMA, Castro said unseasonable rains since January seriously\ninterrupted harvesting and milling operations especially in the\ncentral and western parts of the island.\n    The Cuban leader said the mechanical cane harvesters\nscheduled to cut over 60 pct of the cane this year were\nparticularly \"vulnerable,\" as muddy fields prevent operations.\n    Neither Castro nor the Cuban press have given out figures\nto estimate tonnes of crude production during the present\nharvest or the goals for the sugar campaign.\n    However, a cuban sugar official told Reuters that the\ncountry will be lucky if crude output reaches last year's 7.2\nmln tonnes. Output of crude for the previous 1984-85 harvest\nwas 8.2 mln tonnes.\n    The harvest was scheduled to end April 30 but due to the\npresent shortfalls it will be extended into May and June, the\nofficial said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
