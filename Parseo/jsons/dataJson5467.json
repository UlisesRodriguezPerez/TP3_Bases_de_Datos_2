        "TITLE": "AROUND 3.5 MLN ACRES SAID TO BE IDLED BY 0/92",
        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 16 - ",
        "BODY": "A 0/92 program would have very\nlittle impact on U.S. acreage, prompting farmers to idle only\nan additional 3.5 mln acres of cropland every year, according\nto a report from the Agriculture Department.\n    The savings resulting from the additional 3.5 mln acres\nidled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings, 35\nmln dlrs in transportation and storage savings, and 10-20 mln\ndlrs per year in deficiency payment savings, the report said.\n    The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0/92\nacreage program for wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum and barley.\nLast year, almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested.\n    \"The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause very\nlarge acreages to be removed from crop production is quite\nsmall,\" the report said.\n    \"The returns on typical farms still favor participation in\nthe usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted\nacreage,\" the USDA report said.\n    The 0/92 program, which would allow farmers to forego\nplanting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment,\nwould be most used by producers in high production/high risk\nareas where cost of production is high, said Keith Collins,\ndirector of USDA's economics analysis staff.\n    \"In the heart of the corn belt, you would not get that much\nparticipation,\" Collins said.\n    USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat\nwould be ildled under 0/92, 1.5 mln acres of corn, 500,000\nacres of sorghum and barley and 500,000 acres of cotton.\n    Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40\nmln bushels of wheat, 180 mln bushels of corn, 20 mln bushels\nof sorghum, 10 mln bushels of barley, and 500,000 bales of\ncotton, the report said.\n    \"In determining whether to participate, a producer would\nneed to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the\nloan rate ... The risk that market prices may rise above the\nexpected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be\nconsidered,\" according to the analysis.\n    \"What you're giving up under 0/92 is the difference between\nthe loan rate and the cost of production,\" Collins said.\n    For producers with low production costs, that difference is\ngreater and can be applied to paying variable costs, he said.\nUnder these cicumstances, farmers would not want to go along\nwith 0/92. But for high cost producers, 0/92 would be more\nattractive.\n    Also, as loan rates get lower, Collins said there would be\nmore incentives to participate in a 0/92 program.\n    \"I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at\nfirst, but it is a step towards the goal of separating\nproduction decisions from government payments,\" Collins said.\n    In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and\nFeed Association, USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too\nlate to implement 0/92 for 1987 crops since program signup will\nbe over by the end of this month.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
