        "BODY": "Unocal Corp said it told the U.S.\nTreasury Department that it will not include fluidized bed\ncombustion technology, a method for the more efficient burning\nof solids, at its Parachute Creek oil shale project in Colorado\ndue to high costs.\n    Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct U.S. Synthetic\nFuels Corp, Unocal said it would study using the technology at\nthe oil shale plant. In return the company would have been\neligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supports\nfrom the U.S. Treasury Department, which took over the contract\nfrom the Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said.\n    Unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidized\nbed combustion facility would have exceeded 352 mln dlrs,\ncompared with an original estimate of 260 mln dlrs.\n    The fluidized bed facility would have provided heat and\nelectricity for the oil shale project, Unocal said.\n    Last year's fall in oil prices and the loss of investment\ntax credit under the Tax Reform Act made the project\nuneconomical even with government price supports and loan\nguarantees, Unocal said.\n    The Parachute Creek oil shale plant produces about 4,000 to\n5,000 barrels per day of crude shale oil, Unocal said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
