        "BODY": "The recent purchase of 1.5 mln\ntonnes of U.S. corn by Japan and 600,000 tonnes by South Korea\nsuggests that the two countries' demand for reliable supplies\nof corn is increasing, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.\n    In its World Production and Trade Report, the department\nsaid that view is reinforced by the expectation of a decline in\nexportable supplies of Argentine corn and uncertainty over the\navailability of South African and Chinese corn.\n    With these corn purchases, Japan is committed to buying 7.7\nmln tonnes of U.S. corn in 1986/87 (Sept-Aug), nearly 400,000\ntonnes greater than year-ago figures to date.\n    South Korea's cumulative commitments amount to 2.5 mln\ntonnes, up 1.5 mln compared to last year, it said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
