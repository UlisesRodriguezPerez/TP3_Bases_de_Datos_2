        "BODY": "Central bankers said they\nwere generally satisfied with the response to the Paris accord\ntwo weeks ago to stabilize currencies at around current levels.\n    Speaking after a meeting at the Bank for International\nSettlements (BIS), which reviewed the agreement, they also\nwelcomed interest rates cuts in France and today's drop in\nBritish rates.  One top official said the rate cuts would help\nto stimulate growth generally in Europe and welcomed that\ncountries other than West Germany were seen to be helping\nsustain the economy. \n    The central bankers, who spoke on the condition they not be\nnamed, said the meeting of governors from the Group of 10\ncountries also heard a report from Michel Camdessus, the new\nmanaging director of the International Monetary Fund, on the\nIMF's latest assessment of the debt crisis. In particular, they\ndiscussed Brazil's debt moratorium.\n    But there was no sense of urgency, they said, and Brazil\nhad made no appeal for bridging loans from the BIS or central\nbanks.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
