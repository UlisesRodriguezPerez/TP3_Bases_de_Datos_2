        "BODY": "The U.S. Agriculture Department\nincreased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the Soviet\nUnion to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.\n    In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, the\nUSDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because\nSoviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last\nmonth.\n    USDA said the increased purchasing is \"somewhat surprising\"\nbecause of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.\n    All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn,\nUSDA said.\n    Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12\nmln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnes\nmiscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said.\n    USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop suffered\nthrough a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.\n    The severe winter \"is believed to have resulted in above\naverage winter-kill,\" USDA said.\n    Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses\nmaybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buying\ngrain recently.\n    USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes\ngrain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheat\nand 12 mln tonnes coarse grain.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
