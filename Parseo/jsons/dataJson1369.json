        "BODY": "Eligible producers of 1986 crop U.S.\ncorn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in\ndeficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates\nand 50 pct in cash, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.\n    It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and\nsorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs.\n    Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to\nthe 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman\nbudget deficit control act of 1985, it said.\n    Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency\npayments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225\nmln dlrs, respectively, USDA said.\n    The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents\nper bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were\nreceived by producers requesting advance payments.\n    Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference\nbetween an established target price and the higher of the basic\nloan rate, or the national average price received by farmers\nduring the first five months of the marketing year --\nSeptember-January.\n    National weighted average market prices for the first five\nmonths of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and\n1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. Eligible corn producers will\nbe paid 63 cts per bushel, based on the difference between the\n3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate.\n    Sorghum producers' deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents\nper bushel, based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs per\nbushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loan\nrate.\n    The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the\nmaximum permitted by law, the department said.\n    Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another\n1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average\nmarket prices received by farmers during the entire marketing\nyear for both commodities are below the basic loan rates, the\ndepartment said.\n    The payments will be issued through local Agricultural\nStabilization and Conservation Service offices, it said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
