        "BODY": "Turkey's Gross National Product grew an\nestimated 8.0 pct in 1986 at fixed 1968 prices, compared with\n5.1 pct in 1985, the State Statistics Institute said.\n    Reporting full-year data, it also said Gross Domestic\nProduct rose 8.3 pct compared with 5.1 pct in 1985. An earlier\nestimate from nine-month data put full-year GNP and GDP growth\nboth at 7.9 pct.\n    The government's GNP growth target for 1987 is five pct,\nthe same level it had set for 1986.\n    The institute estimated per capita GNP for 1986 at 1,116.6\ndlrs, up from 1,045.3 dlrs in 1985.\n    Officials blame the high 1986 GNP growth on a surge in\ndomestic demand stemming partly from poorly controlled\nmunicipal expenditures in the early part of the year.\n    Industry grew at 11.1 pct in real terms in 1986 compared\nwith 6.6 pct in 1985 while agriculture expanded 7.4 pct\ncompared with 2.8 pct.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
