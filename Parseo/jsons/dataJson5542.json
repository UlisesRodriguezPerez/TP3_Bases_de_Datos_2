        "TITLE": "NORWAY APPROVES TRADE BAN AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA",
        "DATELINE": "    OSLO, March 16 - ",
        "BODY": "Norway's parliament has approved an\nextensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a\nkey loophole through which controversial oil shipments on\nNorwegian tankers may continue, government officials said.\n    The unilateral boycott, proposed by Norway's minority\nLabour government, gives domestic companies until late\nSeptember to cut remaining trade ties with South Africa and\nNamibia.\n    \"The legislation discussed today must not be seen as an\nisolated measure, but as a step in an international process,\"\nNorway's foreign minister Thorvald Stoltenberg told parliament.\n    Government officials said they hope the move will intensify\ninternational pressure against the Pretoria regime's apartheid\npolicies. Sweden, in a similar move last week, promised to halt\nall trade with South Africa by October.\n    Norway's boycott, although forbidding crude oil shipments\nto South Africa on Norwegian-owned tankers, makes an important\nexception for ships whose final destination is decided while\nthey are at sea.\n    Oil cargoes are often resold by trades after loading,\nmaking it difficult for shipowners to know their ships' final\nport at the start of a voyage.\n    Critics said the bill leaves the door open for continued\noil shipments to South Africa. They called for stricter\nsanctions to stop all Norwegian shipping to South Africa.\n    Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct\nof its crude imports during the early 1980s, but the trade has\ndropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months,\ntrade ministry officials said.\n    The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South\nAfrica dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight\nmonths of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns\nfrom the year-ago figure.\n    \"Many would say that the law has already had its effect\nbecause of the dramatic drop in trade between South African and\nNorway,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Per Paust told Reuters.\n    \"Norwegian business at an early stage started restructuring\nits relations with South Africa in anticipation of the law.\n    \"No one has said the boycott will have a profound effect on\ninternational trade with South Africa, but it is an important\npolitical statement by the Norwegian government,\" he said.\n    The Oslo government said it will review the effects of the\nban on Norwegian industry after two years and may propose\namendments if industry can show it is hurt by the law.\n    Norwegian imports from South Africa are limited mainly to\nhigh-grade manganese and coppernickle ores used in it\nferro-alloys and light metals industries.\n    Metals manufacturers estimate some 2,000 jobs could be\naffected by the boycott is suitable replacements for these ores\nare not found.\n    The legislation now goes on to the upper house for formal\nratification later this week, parliamentarians said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
