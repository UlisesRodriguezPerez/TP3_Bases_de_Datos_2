        "BODY": "The Soviet economy recovered slightly\nlast month after a poor performance in January, but major\nindustries, including oil and machinery, are still short of\nproduction targets, official figures show.\n    Central Statistical Board data published in the weekly\nEkonomicheskaya Gazeta yesterday showed that industrial output\nwas only up 0.8 pct in the first two months of 1987 over the\nsame period of last year.\n    However, the figure for January alone showed a fall in\noutput of 0.1 pct from a year earlier. Production is targetted\nto increase 4.4 pct for all of 1987.\n    The figures showed that only 77 pct of enterprises met\ntheir supply obligations in January and February.\n    Production of oil, the country's main export to Western\nnations, hit 100 mln tonnes in January and February, up from\n97.3 mln a year earlier, and exceeded its target by 0.5 pct.\n    Economists said this reflected the huge investments poured\ninto the oil sector in recent months in an effort to reverse\nthe stagnation in production which began in November 1983.\n    Falling world oil prices last year helped cause a decline\nin Soviet trade with the West to 130 billion roubles from 141.6\nbillion in 1985.\n    Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta said labour productivity targets\nwere also not fulfilled, but did not give figures.\n    Economists said the overall data reflected exceptionally\nbad weather at the start of the year and stricter quality\ncontrols imposed on enterprises.\n    Production in the machine-building sector, a priority in\nMoscow's plans for economic renewal, recovered slightly in\nFebruary but was still 3.6 pct lower in the first two months of\nthe year compared with the same period of 1986.\n    The figures showed that five republics produced less than\nin the first two months of 1986.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
