        "BODY": "The Finnish metal and mining group\nOutokumpu Oy said it will close its nickel refinery at\nHarjavalta in central Finland for six weeks in July and August\nthis year due to current low prices on the nickel market.\n    \"We consider nickel prices as bad at the moment, although\nthey have been rising slightly since January,\" refinery sales\nmanager Pekka Purra said.\n    He said the closure will mean a drop in production of 3,000\ntonnes in 1987 from last year's output of 17,800 tonnes. The\nclosure was also a move to cut labour costs as no extra staff\nhave to be employed during holidays to keep the plant open.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
