        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, April 2 - ",
        "BODY": "An amendment approved by the House\nAgriculture Committee yesterday requiring quotas on U.S.\nimports of products containing sugar is unlikely to remain in a\ncomprehensive trade bill, Congressional sources said.\n    The amendment, offered by Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn.,\nwould require quotas on the import of any merchandise\ncontaining over 25 pct sugar or other farm products which are\nnow subject to U.S. quotas.\n    Supporters of the amendment said it is aimed at curbing\nshipments of food products containing sugar from Canada.\nHowever, the Ways and Means committee, which has overall\njurisdiction on trade legislation, will try to kill the\namendment as protectionist, a committee aide said.\n    An Agriculture committee aide acknowledged the proposal\nprobably will not survive scrutiny by other House committees.\nBut he said the amendment was introduced in part to send a\nwarning to U.S. companies considering moving food processing\nplants to Canada to avoid the restrictive U.S. sugar quota.\n    In debate on the amendment yesterday, Rep. Stangeland and\nother supporters said the proposal would have no effect on the\nstatus of foreign trade zones.\n    Sugar producer groups pushed for the amendment on\nsugar-containing products because they believe sugar is being\nshipped to the United States in food products as a way to\ncircumvent the quota on raw sugar.\n    The sugar quota is only one mln short tons this year.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
