        "BODY": "OPEC's agreement to limit output to 16.6\nmln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost\nspot prices and enable the group to raise its official\nreference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current\n18 dlrs, Far East oil industry sources said.\n    \"Fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and the\nofficial price will be 20 dlrs in January,\" a Japanese refiner\nsaid.\n    The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC\nmembers such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and\nQatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter.\n    Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading as\nthe market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987\noutput. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs\nfor Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for\nU.K. Brent, traders said.\n    They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into\nthe U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate\n(WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.\n    \"With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will import\nMideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those\ngrades further,\" said a Japanese oil trader.\n    Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot\nmarket has further upward potential in the short term, having\nrisen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday.\n    \"You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that\nbasis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today,\" said\none international oil trader in Tokyo.\n    \"But I think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be bought\nback up again pretty quickly,\" he added.\n    One oil industry analyst concurred, \"There is no reason to\nexpect a weak market from now on.\" He said he expected OPEC to\nraise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9.\n    Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly\nin the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and\nthe likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to\nmaintain steady prices.\n    Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day\ncompared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Its\nexport capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline\nthrough Turkey, comes onstream in or around September.\n    Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd,\nagainst its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up\nto 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said.\n    Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating\non the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price\ndiscounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. But\nthey mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as\nswing producer, cutting production to compensate for higher\noutput by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise\ntoo high too fast.\n    Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln\nbarrels. \"Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the\nstockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises\ntoo much,\" an oil industry analyst said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
