        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, April 1 - ",
        "BODY": "Speculation the United States will\noffer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have\nreached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary of\nState George Shultz' visit later this month to Moscow.\n    Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat\nmarkets since officials from the two countries held their\ncustomary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow's\ndecision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn market\nstrengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.\n    Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
