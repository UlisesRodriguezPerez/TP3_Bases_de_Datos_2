        "BODY": "Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWL.L> said\nproposals to resolve a dispute over entry to Japan's\ntelecommunications market were not acceptable.\n    A company spokesman said the proposals appear to have been\nmade in today's edition of the Japanese daily Asahi by Fumio\nWatanabe, head of a telecommunications committee with the\nFederation of Economic Organisations.\n    However, the suggestion still recommended a merger between\nthe two consortia tendering for contracts and would give Cable\na five pct stake, more than the three pct originally proposed\nbut less than the 20 pct it holds in its original venture, he\nsaid.\n    The proposal would also offer a Cable nominee a seat on the\nboard of the merged company.\n    The spokesman said he believed Japan should accept\napplications from the two rivals for fair review.\n    Earlier today Cable shares firmed on market speculation\nthat the dispute -- which is being treated by Britain's\ngovernment as a test case of how open the Japanese\ntelecommunications market is -- was near settlement.\n    Cable shares at 1350 GMT were quoted at 375p compared with\na close last night at 364p.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
