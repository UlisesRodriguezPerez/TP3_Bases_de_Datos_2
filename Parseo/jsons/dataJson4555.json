        "BODY": "Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul\nVolcker said both the Fed and the financial markets remain\nconcerned about the possibility of renewed inflation.\n    \"A possibility of renewed inflation remains of concern,\nboth in the markets and within the Federal Reserve,\" he said in\nremarks prepared for delivery to a group of business leaders\nhere.\n    He said one potential channel for renewed inflationary\npressures would be an excessive fall of the dollar in the\nexchange markets, which would push import prices up sharply.\n    He said participants in financial markets and business\nremain skeptical of prospects for lasting price stability.\n    \"Should the skepticism about our ability to resist\ninflation be reinforced by bad policy, the consequences for\ninterest rates, for exchange rates, and for the economy\ngenerally would clearly be undesirable...recognition of that\ndanger neccesarily must weigh heavily in the formation of\nmonetary policy,\" the Fed chairman said.\n    Volcker said attempts to drive the dollar much lower would\nundermine the hard won gains against inflation and would risk\ndissipating the flow of foreign capital.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
