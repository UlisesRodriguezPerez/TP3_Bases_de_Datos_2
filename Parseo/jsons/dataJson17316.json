        "BODY": "About 20 members of the Taiwan\nparliament criticised the government for holding too much of\nforeign exchange reserves in U.S. Dollars and asked the cabinet\nto diversify these holdings into other major currencies.\n    A parliament statement said the criticism came from 18\nKuomintang (nationalist) legislators and several opposition\nmembers, who asked the government to diversify reserves into\nmark, yen, Swiss franc, other currencies or gold.\n    It said that from September 1985 to September 1986 the\ncentral bank's exchange rate loss was about 144 billion Taiwan\ndlrs.\n    Fourteen local banks lost 12.6 billion Taiwan dlrs during\nthe period, it said.\n    In the same time span the Taiwan dollar rose to 36.77 to\nthe U.S. Currency from 40.45. It closed at 33.17 today.\n    The statement said the central bank's loss this year would\nmore than double because of the rising Taiwan dollar and\nreserves, which had reached 54 billion U.S. Dlrs last week.\n    Government legislators said they expected the reserves to\nincrease to more than 60 billion U.S. Dlrs this year and the\ntrade surplus to increase by about 15 billion U.S. Dlrs,\ncompared with 15.6 billion last year.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
