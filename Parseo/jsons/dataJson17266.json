        "DATELINE": "    TOKYO, April 27 - ",
        "BODY": "Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa\ntold a parliamentary Upper House budget committee that he does\nnot think the dollar is in a freefall.\n    He said concerted intervention is only a supplementary\nmeasure to moderate volatility in exchange rates and repeated\nthat policy coordination among major industrial nations is\nnecessary. \"We cannot expect currency stability only through\ncoordinated market intervention,\" he said.\n    Miyazawa also told the committee the U.S. Has not called on\nJapan to cut its 2.5 pct discount rate.\n    Miyazawa said the government is not considering investing\nin U.S. Government bonds to help stabilize exchange rates. This\nmatter has to be dealt with carefully because it involves the\npublic's money and exchange rates are moving widely, he added.\n    The ministry will consider where to invest its funds when\nexchange rates become stable, he said.\n    Asked if Japan is considering a request to the U.S. For it\nto raise its discount rate to stabilize exchange rates,\nMiyazawa said the U.S. Has not been able to take action now\nbecause it has to maintain its economic growth.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
