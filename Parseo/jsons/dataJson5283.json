        "BODY": "Banca della Svizzera Italiana <BISZ.Z>\nsaid it planned a one-for-12 rights issue at 300 pct of nominal\nvalue to raise about 50 mln francs new capital.\n    The rights issue would have a theoretical value to\nshareholders of 140 Swiss francs per bearer share and 45 per\nregistered share.\n    BSI was also seeking shareholder authorization for 200,000\nnew participation certificates of a nominal value of 100 francs\nwithout rights for shareholders, to back future convertible or\nwarrant bonds or for other purposes. Existing 500-franc \"B\"\ntranche certificates would be split five-for-one.\n    The split would improve the marketability of the existing\ncertificates, chief executive Giorgio Ghiringhelli told a news\nconference.\n    The new bearer shares would be priced at 1,500 francs,\ncompared with a closing price last Friday of 3,325 on the\nZurich Stock Exchange, while the registered shares would be\nissued at 300 francs against a market price of 900.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
