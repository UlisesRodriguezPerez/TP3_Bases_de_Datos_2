        "DATELINE": "    MCALLEN, Texas, June 15 - ",
        "BODY": "The growing shift of low-skilled\nmanufacturing jobs from the United States to Mexican border\ncities is not a threat to American employment because it will\nhelp create new markets for products, according to a study\nreleased today.\n    Richard Bolin, director of the Flagstaff Institute of\nArizona, which studies international trade issues, said the\nUnited States needs to encourage the expansion of manufacturing\nin developing countries so that those nations can become\nconsumers of more U.S. goods.\n    His study was commissioned by the border city of McAllen,\nTexas, for presentation to the International Trade Commission\nwhich is gathering information for a report to Congress on what\nchanges may be needed in the U.S. tariff codes to prevent the\nloss of jobs and industry.\n    McAllen and other Texas border cities have benefitted from\na trend among U.S. companies to build twin plants that employ\nfactory workers on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.\n    More than 700 manufacturers are taking advantage of lenient\ntax codes that allow U.S. companies to bring raw goods into\nMexico for assembly by low-skilled workers into products that\nare completed by U.S. workers at a nearby sister plant.\n    Bolin said his research indicated that the shift in\nlow-paying jobs across the border reflected changing\ndemographics of the U.S. workforce.\n    \"In the post-baby boom era, fewer workers will be available\nto fill these low-skill jobs -- and these workers will be\nbetter educated than prior generations,\" Bolin told reporters in\nMcAllen.\n    \"The jobs in low-tech industries that are being exported to\nother countries are, for the most part, jobs that we may not be\nable to fill in the future.\"\n    U.S. employment in less-skilled manufacturing jobs plunged\nby more than 900,000 between 1977 and 1982, largely due to the\ntransfer of jobs outside U.S. borders, he said. American\nemployment in high-tech industries increased by 634,000 during\nthe same period, he said.\n    But high-tech industries, those in which engineers make up\nmore than six percent of the workforce, pay higher wages and\ngenerate more U.S. exports than low-tech businesses, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
