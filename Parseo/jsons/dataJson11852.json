        "BODY": "The climate for precious metals is\nimproving with prices benefiting from renewed inflation fears\nand the switching of funds from dollar and stock markets,\nbrokers Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd said.\n    Silver prices in March gained some 15 pct in dlr terms due\nto a weak dollar and silver is felt to be fairly cheap relative\nto gold, Montagu said in its monthly silver newsletter. In\nMarch the gold/silver ratio narrowed from 74 to less than 67.\n    The supply/demand position has improved in the past year,\nand despite a silver market surplus, the quantity of silver is\nmodest enough to be absorbed by investors, it added.\n    The report said the firmness in oil prices was likely to\ncontinue in the short term.\n    A period of consolidation might be necessary before prices\nattempted to move significantly higher,it said, but so long as\nthe dollar remains under pressure then the outlook for silver\nwas positive.\n    However silver was less likely to continue to outpace the\nother metals by such a margin, Montagu said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
