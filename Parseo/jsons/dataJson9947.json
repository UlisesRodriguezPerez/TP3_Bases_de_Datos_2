        "BODY": "British Petroleum Co PLC's\nannouncement that its U.S. subsidiary intends to tender for the\n45 pct of Standard Oil Co <SRD> it does not already own,\ncatapulted U.S. oil stocks sharply higher this morning, traders\nand analysts said.\n    \"It raises the specter of additional consolidation in the\nindustry and that is what is boosting the other oils,\" analyst\nRosario Ilacqua of L.F. Rothschild said.\n    Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers said \"this\ndeal shows that British Petroleum, a conservative investor that\nknows the oil business, is clearly confident in the U.S. oil\nindustry, and that shines well on the U.S. companies.\"\n    Philips Petroleum <P> gained 3/4 to 15-7/8, Occidental\nPetroleum <OXY> one to 34-5/8, USX Corp <X>, with its Marathon\nOil Co unit, rose 1/2 to 28-3/8. Exxon <XON> climbed one to\n88-3/8, Mobil <MOB> one to 50-1/4, Atlantic Richfield <ARC>\n3-1/8 to 80-1/2, Amoco <AN> 1-7/8 to 84-1/8, and Amerada Hess\none to 33-5/8. BP gained 2-3/8 to 59-3/4.\n    Both analysts said the rise in Standard's price this\nmorning to above the proposed tender price of 70 dlrs a share,\nis an indication that investors expect the bid to be sweetened.\nStandard gained 6-3/4 to 71-5/8.\n    The analysts cited Royal Dutch/Shell Group's <RD> <SC> bid\nfor Shell Oil Co, which was sweetened before its successful\nconclusion.\n    Margoshes said the BP action \"is an articulation of the\nunderlying value of oil companies in the marketplace.\" But he\nexpressed skepticism that this will necessarily lead to\nheightened merger or buyout activity in the oil group.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
