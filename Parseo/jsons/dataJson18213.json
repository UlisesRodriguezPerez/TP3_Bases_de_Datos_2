        "BODY": "Overseas Shipholding Group Inc president\nMorton Hyman said if oil production by OPEC rises during the\nsecond half of 1987, freight rates for tankers should rise\naccordingly.\n    Hyman, delivering a speech at the annual shareholders\nmeeting, said international tanker markets were generally weak\nthroughout the first quarter, but since the end of March OPEC\noil production has picked up. The result has been a modest\nimprovement in tanker rates.\n    Overseas said 73 pct of its fleet handles liquid cargo.\n   \n    He said tanker requirements decreased in September 1986 as\nOPEC production quotas dropped and levels of oil stocks rose.\n    For the first quarter 1987, the company reported net income\nof 10.3 mln dlrs, or 40 cts per share, compared to 9.3 mln\ndlrs, or 36 cts per share, for the comparable quarter a year\nago.\n    The company reported net income for 1986 of 37.3 mln dlrs,\nor 1.45 dlrs per share.\n   \n    \"The improvement in the company's 1986 results, after four\nyears of declining earnings, reflects a sharp, albeit\ntemporary, rise in freight rates in the international tanker\nmarkets last summer,\" Hyman said.\n    He said the Alaskan oil trade continues to be the principal\nsource of employment for its U.S. flag tanker fleet, which\nrepresents approximately 15 pct of the company's tonnage.\n    Overseas owns and operates 67 vessels.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
