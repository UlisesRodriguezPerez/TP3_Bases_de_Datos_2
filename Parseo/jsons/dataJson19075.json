        "BODY": "South Africa recorded annualised\nreal growth in GDP of 3.25 pct in the first quarter of this\nyear and the economy should achieve the government's target of\nthree pct growth for 1987, the Reserve Bank said.\n    The South African central bank said in its quarterly\nbulletin that confidence in the economy improved from January\nto May 31 because of the higher gold price, a rise in the\nnation's gold and foreign currency reserves and an improvement\nin the rand's exchange rate to just under 50 U.S. Cents.\n    It noted the growth rate had slowed from 4.5 pct in the\nthird and fourth quarters of last year.\n    It also cited a three year debt recheduling agreement\nreached with international creditors in March as evidence of\nimproved foreign perceptions of the South African economy.\n    The accord effectively extends a moratorium on most\nrepayments of 13 billion dlrs of South Africa's short term\nforeign debt. Total foreign debt is 23 billion dlrs.\n    South Africa recorded a seasonally adjusted annualised\nsurplus on the current account of the balance of payments of\n7.43 billion rand in the first quarter, compared with a surplus\nof 7.24 billion rand in 1986. The bank said it was the ninth\nconsecutive current account surplus since the start of 1985.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
