        "BODY": "<Independent Newspapers Ltd> (INL)\nsaid it bought two more community newspapers in Houston, Texas,\nthrough a subsidiary there, for an undisclosed sum.\n    INL said in a statement <Houston Community Newspapers Inc>\nbought the South West Advocate and the South Bend Advocate,\nwith combined circulation of 74,000 copies, and associated\nassets, from <The Advocate Communications Corp Inc>.\n    INL publishes Wellington's morning and evening newspapers\nas well as New Zealand provincial dailies and newspapers in\nRhode Island. Just under 40 pct of INL is owned by <News Ltd>,\nan Australian subsidiary of News Corp Ltd <NCPA.S>.\n    Production and administration of the two publications would\nbe transferred to the company's existing centre in Houston. INL\nsaid the acquisition took effect on March 1.\n    INL chairman Alan Burnet said the purchase would enable the\nsubsidiary to offer advertisers a combined distribution of nine\ncommunity newspapers to 340,000 homes in the greater Houston\narea. Trading conditions in the area are particularly difficult\nbecause the city's economy depends to a large extent on the\nfortunes of the petroleum industry, but the situation should\nimprove in the medium to long term and the investment will\nprove to be sound, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
