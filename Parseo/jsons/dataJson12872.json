        "BODY": "Greece has agreed to buy between 27,000\nand 33,000 tonnes of Spanish corn, a spokesman for Cargill's\nSpanish unit Compania Industrial y de Abastecimiento S.A.\n(CINDASA) said.\n    He told Reuters the sale price was around 28.95 pesetas per\nkilo but that the final quantity and delivery date has not yet\nbeen set. The corn will be shipped in the coming days from\nValencia.\n    He said CINDASA will also ship 6,000 to 7,000 tonnes of\nSpanish corn to Italy in the second half of this month.\n    The CINDASA spokesman said other corn shipments this month\nwill include between 15,000 and 30,000 tonnes bound initially\nfor Rotterdam and Ghent and destined for unspecified northern\nEuropean countries. He said shipments of 35,000 to 50,000\ntonnes of low specific gravity barley were also expected this\nmonth and added that Greece, the Netherlands, Ireland and\nBelgium were considering imports of Spanish flour for milling.\n    Market sources said the corn exports, the absence of\nimports from the rest of the EC and the delay in shipments of\ncorn from the U.S. Had pushed domestic corn prices up by around\n0.25 pesetas a kilo today compared with yesterday.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
