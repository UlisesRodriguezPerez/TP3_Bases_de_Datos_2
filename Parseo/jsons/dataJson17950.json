        "BODY": "Glynwed International Plc <GLYN.L> said it\nhad bought all the issued shares of two companies belonging to\nGallaher Ltd, a subsidiary of American Brands Inc <AMB>, in a\ndeal worth around 14 mln stg.\n    The full names of the companies purchased from Gallaher are\n<Formatura Iniezione Polimeri Spa>, Genoa and <FIP U.K. Ltd>,\nWeybridge.\n    Consideration for the purchases, which will be based on the\nnet asset values per share of the companies, has yet to be\nfinalised but some nine mln stg of the total represents debt\nassumed by Glynwed.\n    FIP is a manufacturer of valves and other pressure pipe\nfittings in thermoplastics. Its products are complementary to\nthose of Glynwed subsidiaries, Durapipe U.K. And Philmac.\n    The acquisitions appreciably develop and strengthen\nGlynwed's strategic position in the thermoplastic pipework\nsystems market.\n    The sale by Gallaher reflects a decision to dispose of more\nperipheral businesses. Proceeds of the sale will be used in the\ncontinuing expansion of the Gallaher group. Glynwed shares were\nup 5p to 494 after the announcement. Gallaher is not quoted on\nthe London Stock Exchange.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
