        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, March 24 - ",
        "BODY": "American Express Co's <AXP> recent\nlaunch of a new \"OPTIMA\" credit card, with relatively low\ninterest rates and fees, will increase competition with bank\ncredit-card issuers but will not lead to a pricing war, a\nsenior Citicorp offical said.\n    \"Over the next two to three years, a very interesting\nmarketing battle will be fought ... competition will not be on\nprice but on product features,\" Pei-yuan Chia, head of the U.S.\ncard products group, told a banking analysts meeting.\n    Citicorp is the leading U.S. bank credit-card issuer, with\nsome 10 mln accounts and an 11 pct market share.\n    Chia said that Citicorp would focus its credit card\nmarketing efforts on acceptance, noting that Visa and\nMastercard currently enjoy a two-to-one advantage over American\nExpress in terms of worldwide acceptance.\n    He also doubted the popularity of American Express' plan to\nlink interest charges on the new OPTIMA card to the bank prime\nlending rate. \"The consumer likes to have a fixed rate\ninstrument,\" he said.\n    Richard Braddock, head of the whole individual banking\ndivision, added that when there is increased competition, \"it\nis not the big people who get crunched but the small ones.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
