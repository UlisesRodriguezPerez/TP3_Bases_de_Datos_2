        "DATELINE": "    HAILEY, Idaho, March 20 - ",
        "BODY": "Geodome Resources Ltd said\nfollowing receipt of a feasibility study from Raytheon Co's\n<RTN> Stearns Catalytic unit, it will proceed with construction\nand pre-production stripping at its Sunbeam Mine in Custer\nCounty, Idaho, as quickly as possible.\n    The company said the study found proven ore reserves of\n3,302,000 short tons grading 0.077 ounce of gold per ton.  It\nsaid the mine will operate at a rate of 626,000 tons of ore per\nyear, with higher-grade ore being mined in the first three\nyears for a rapid payback of capital costs.\n    The company said the feasibility study calls for gold\nproduction averaging 41,000 ounces a year for the life of the\nmine and 50,000 ounces a year over the first three years, with\n99,000 ounces of silver per year being produced over the miune\nlife.\n    Capital costs would be 22.3 mln dlrs with all-new equipment\nand 500,000 to one mln dlrs less with used equipment, it said. \nIt said the mine would be operated by a contract miner but the\nassociated mill by Geodome.\n    Geodome said a new ore zone discovered last summer is not\nincluded in reserve calculations. It said eight of the nine\nholes drilled there have an average grade of 0.046 ounce of\ngold and 2.1 ounces of silver per ton. Also excluded are\nreserves of 1,400,000 tons of low-grade material that could be\nmilled profitably at 425 dlrs a ton for gold. The feasibility\nstudy used a 350 dlr gold price.\n    Geodome said operating costs of the mine will average 201\ndlr per ounce of gold for the mine life and 171 dlrs for the\nfirst three years, in constant dollars.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
