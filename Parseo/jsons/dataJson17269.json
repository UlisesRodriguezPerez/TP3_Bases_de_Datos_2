        "BODY": "President Reagan warned the U.S.\nCongress in his weekly radio address against passing what he\ncalled dangerous, protectionist trade legislation that would\ntie his hands in trade negotiations with Japan and other\ncountries.\n    Reagan, who will hold talks with Japanese Prime Minister\nYasuhiro Nakasone here this week, said he would lift tariffs\nimposed last week against some Japanese products as soon as\nTokyo complied with a U.S.-Japanese pact on semiconductors.\n    U.S. officials gave the same message to former Japanese\nForeign Minister Shintaro Abe in talks here last week.\n    In his weekly radio address on Saturday, Reagan said he\nwould tell Nakasone: \"We want to continue to work cooperatively\non trade problems and want very much to lift these trade\nrestrictions as soon as evidence permits.\n    Reagan said the 100 pct tariffs he imposed on some 300 mln\ndlrs worth of Japanese goods was a special case of trade\nretaliation and did not signal a shift in what he called his\nstaunch anti-protectionist policies.\n    \"In imposing these tariffs we were just trying to deal with\na particular problem, not begin a trade war,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
