        "BODY": "The sale of the government's 25.55 pct\nstake in VEBA AG <VEBG.F> is still expected this month, banking\nsources closely linked with the transaction said.\n    A spokesman for the Finance Ministry said no exact date had\nyet been set for the privatisation, which the government has\ntabled for the second half of March. However, he added a\nscandal at Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, VW, over currency losses \"has\nnothing to do\" with the timing of the VEBA sale.\n    Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has said the sale of\nthe Federal government's stake in VW, originally scheduled for\nlater this year, may be delayed because of the currency affair.\n    A banker involved in the VEBA placement said \"Nothing has\nchanged in the planning. I still presume that it will take\nplace in the second half of March.\"\n    This banker said there would be no reason to postpone the\nissue of the 10 mln VEBA shares for a few days. He added that\nthe consortium which is arranging the deal had completed its\npreparatory work, although the price had not been decided.\n    The VEBA share has been weaker ahead of the placement but\nWest German stocks have been generally bearish and news of the\nVW scandal last week put further pressure on the market.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
