        "BODY": "Based on field travel in the\nBrazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be about\naverage or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. Agriculture\nDepartment's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.\n    The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about\n20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.\n    It said generally favorable weather from early December\nthrough February helped compensate for earlier dryness.\n    However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days\nfollowed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second\nweek of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans\nwhich are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the\nreport said.\n    The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create\nserious storage problems, the report said.\n    Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by\nmore than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are\nexpected to be above average, it said.\n    Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop\ncrop has been harvested.\n    During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain\nelevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the\nreport said.\n    New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Parana\naccounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasons\nfor the decline are expected reduced government support price\nand good summer crop harvests.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
