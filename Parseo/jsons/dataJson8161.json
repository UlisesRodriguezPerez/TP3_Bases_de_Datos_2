        "BODY": "China's top leader Deng Xiaoping said\nChina must not import more than 10 mln tonnes of grain, Ming\nPao newspaper of Hong Kong said.\n    Customs figures show that China imported 7.73 mln tonnes of\ngrain in 1986, up from 5.97 mln in 1985 but down from a record\n16.15 mln in 1982.\n    The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that grain output is\none of several key issues that will influence the whole\ndevelopment of the economy. It did not give the context of his\nremarks. The 1987 grain production target is 405 mln, up from\n391 mln in 1986.\n    The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that the situation has\nreached the point where \"pigs are not fed, there is not enough\ngrain and increases in output have slowed.\"\n    \"We should in our overall economic planning put agriculture\nin its proper place to reach our target of 480 mln tonnes by\nthe year 2000,\" he said. \"We must avoid the situation in recent\nyears of importing more than 10 mln tonnes of grain.\"\n    The paper quoted Deng as saying that the State Council has\ndecided to raise the price of five grains, including corn and\nrice, unchanged since 1978, but it gave no details.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
