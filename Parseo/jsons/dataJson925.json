        "TITLE": "CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S.",
        "AUTHOR": "    By Mark O'Neill, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    PEKING, March 3 - ",
        "BODY": "China called on the United States to\nremove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading\nstatus and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.\n    But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing\n13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are\ninaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade\nCongress to change laws which limit its exports.\n     The official International Business newspaper today\npublished China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the\nvisit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.\n     \"It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its\nrestrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities\nfor them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese\nexports,\" the editorial said.\n     \"The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against\nfavourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China\ninto the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).\n     \"Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in\nrecent years, control of them is still extremely strict and\ninfluences normal trade between the two countries,\" it added\n     The paper also printed an article by China's commercial\ncounsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said\nthat \"all kinds of difficulties and restrictions\" were preventing\nbilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.\n     He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on\ntechnology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.\n     The paper also printed a table showing that, since\nbilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit every\nyear except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits\nat 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs.\n     A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept\nPeking's trade figures at all, mainly because they exclude\ngoods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While\nU.S. Figures are based on country of origin.\n     He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it will\nhave to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several\nlaws which currently prevent Peking getting such status.\n     The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP,\nChina must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and\nTrade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and \"not be\ndominated or controlled by international Communism.\"\n     The official said China was well aware of the laws, some\nof which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but that\nthere is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change\nthem.\n     China has been the subject of about a dozen cases\ninvolving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years,\nwhich the U.S. Side won, he said.\n     But, for the first time, China signed last week an\nagreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain\nexports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may\nlead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added.\n     Another diplomat said willingness to provide such\nvoluntary export restraints would be an important issue in\nbilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT.\n     \"China has the potential to disrupt world markets,\nespecially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous\nabout China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other\ncentralled planned economies in GATT,\" the diplomat said.\n     Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members of\nGATT but none has China's massive market potential for imports\nor its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports.\n     In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S.\nSecretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed\nChina's interest in participating in GATT.\n     \"The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished\novernight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large\neconomy of the Chinese type,\" Shultz said.\n     \"China can play an important role by actively joining GATT\ndiscussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and\nenhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further\ndevelop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum\nbenefit from its GATT participation,\" he said.\n     The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership\nare similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen\nregard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially\nfor exports, and a de facto dual currency system.\n     In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT\nlast month, China said it was gradually reforming its economic\nsystem and replacing mandatory instruction with \"guidance\nplanning\" and economic levers.\n     The diplomat said that, to join GATT, China had much to\ndo.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
