        "BODY": "A Belgian finance ministry spokesman\nsaid new rules planned on insider trading would enable\noffenders to be fined and imprisoned for up to a year, and be\ncompelled to forfeit gains.\n    The new rules require parliamentary approval, and\ngovernment sources said it was unclear when they would come\ninto force. Insider trading is currently not an offence in this\ncountry.\n    The cabinet approved a separate bill that analysts said\nincludes provisions to make more difficult the build-up of\nmajor new stakes in Belgian companies.\n    The bill would make obligatory the declaration of major\nstakes in companies quoted on the bourse with own resources of\nmore than 200 mln francs.\n    The Minister for Economic Affairs would need to be informed\nin advance of deals under which foreign interests planned to\nbuy a new stake of more than ten pct of the voting shares in a\nlarge Belgian company, or to increase an existing stake to more\nthan 20 pct.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
