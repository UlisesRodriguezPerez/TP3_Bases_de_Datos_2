        "BODY": "World group turnover of Siemens AG\n<SIEG.F> should rise to 51 or 52 billion marks in the current\nyear to September 31 after a 19 pct upturn in the first five\nmonths, management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said.\n    Siemens reported world group turnover in 1985/86 of 47.02\nbillion marks.\n    Kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to\n21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986/87, about\n19 pct above the same year-ago period. The rise was mainly due\nto payment in January for a West German nuclear power station\nwhich led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct.\n    In the first five 1986/87 months, turnover abroad showed a\nthree pct increase, Kaske said, without giving figures.\n    In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8\nbillion marks against the same 1985/86 period.\n    For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise between\none and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion.\n    Apart from payments for the nuclear power station, the\ncommunications and telecommunications sectors in particular\nshould contribute to growth this year, Kaske said.\n    But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for\n1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of the\ndollar, Kaske said.\n    Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 group\nnet profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in the\nsame period in the previous year.\n    Turnover in the first five months rose particularly\nstrongly in the installations and automotive technology,\ncommunications and telecommunications sectors, but components\nand energy and automation showed a sharp decline.\n    Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks in\nthe first five months of this year, or nine pct above their\nlevel in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular by\norders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary.\n    Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. An\nincrease in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroad\nwas balanced by the decline in the dollar.\n    While the installations and automotive technology sector\nshowed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation and\ncommunications orders were below the level achieved in the same\nperiod of 1985/86.\n    Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the same\nlevel.\n    Kaske said investments were expected to remain around six\nbillion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previous\nyear. Research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to\n6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
