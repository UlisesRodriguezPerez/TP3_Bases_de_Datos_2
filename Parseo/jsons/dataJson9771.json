        "BODY": "Lucas Industries Plc <LUCS.L> said its\nunderlying performance would continue to improve in the second\nhalf but profits would be restrained by low activity in U.K.\nCommercial vehicle and tractor markets as well as in North\nAmerican electronics.\n    The company earlier reported a two mln stg rise in pretax\nprofit to 40 mln in the six months to end-January. The figure\nwas some five mln below forecasts and Lucas shares dropped\nsharply to 557.5p at 1130 GMT from last night's close of 590p.\n    It said it would continue with plans for all its activities\nto be internationally competitive and profitable.\n    Costs of restructuring, reorganisation, employee training\nand retraining, particularly in the UK automotive businesses,\ntogether with high research and development spending would\naffect profits in the short term.\n    But Lucas said it was exploiting growth opportunities in\nautomotive markets, especially in vehicle breaking and engine\nmanagement systems. Recent acquisitions in North America had\nstrengthened Lucas Aerospace and Lucas Industrial systems.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
