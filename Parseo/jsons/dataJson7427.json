        "BODY": "Asea Group, the diversified industrial\nconcern based in Vasteras, Sweden, said it expects 1987\nearnings, after financial income and expense, to be flat\ncompared with 1986, when it earned 2.53 billion Swedish crowns,\nor 371.1 mln dlrs.\n    A company spokesman said 1986 results were boosted\nsignificantly by the booking of two large orders for nuclear\npower plants.\n    This gain, he said, will be balanced in 1987 by a return to\nprofitability by Asea's power transmission segment, which had a\nloss of 183 mln crowns, or 26.9 mln dlrs, last year.\n    Currency conversions were made at 6.81 crowns to the dlr.\n    The spokesman said the company has built up a strong\nbacklog of orders that will contribute to earnings in 1988 and\nbeyond.\n    At yearend 1986, Asea's order backlog stood at 32.7 billion\ncrowns, or 4.8 billion dlrs, up from 30.9 billion, or 4.5\nbillion dlrs, at the end of 1985.\n    Asea has operations in power generation and transmission,\ntransportation equipment, pollution control and robotics.\n    Total sales in 1986 were 46 billion crowns, or 6.8 billion\ndlrs.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
