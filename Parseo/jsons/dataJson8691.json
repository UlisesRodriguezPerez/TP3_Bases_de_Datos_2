        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, March 24 - ",
        "BODY": "Ecolab Inc said it has started its\npreviously-announced tender offer for all shares of ChemLawn\nCorp at 36.50 dlrs each.\n    In a newspaper advertisement, the company said the offer\nand withdrawal rights expire April 20 unless extended.  The\nChemLawn board has approved the tender and a merger at the same\nprice that is to follow.\n    Ecolab said the offer is conditioned on receipt of at least\n5,325,000 shares.  ChemLawn now has about 10.0 mln shares\noutstanding.\n    Ecolab said ChemLawn has granted it a conditional option to\nbuy all authorized but unissued and unreseved ChemLawn shares\nat 36.50 dlrs each.  The option is exercisable in the event\nthat another party were to acquire 20 pct or more of ChemLawn\nby means other than a tender offer for all shares at a higher\nprice than Ecolab is offering.\n    The company said if the merger agreement is terminated\nunder certain circumstasnces, it will be entitled to receive 20\nmln dlrs in damages from ChemLawn.\n    Ecolab said officers and directors of ChemLawn have granted\nit options to acquire an aggregate of 2,535,435 ChemLawn shares\nor about 24.8 pct for the tender price, again unless a higher\ntender were to be made by another party.\n    Waste Management Inc <WMX> had originally made a hostile\ntender offer of 27 dlrs per share for ChemLawn which ChemLawn\nrejected as inadequate.  On Friday, Waste Management said it\nwould raise its bid to 35 dlrs per share.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
