        "DATELINE": "    DALLAS, Oct 9 - ",
        "BODY": "Telex Corp said its board adopted a\nshareholder rights plan which will allow shareholders to\npurchase one common share for two dlrs if a hostile group\nacquires 15 pct or more of the company.\n    However, the company said the plan will not be triggered by\npurchases pursuant to the 65 dlrs a share tender offer\ncommenced on October 9 by a unit of TLX Partners, a group\ncontrolled by New York financier Asher Edelman.\n    It said the rights will be distributed on a one for one\nbasis to all shareholders as of October 30 and may be redeemed\nbefore they become exercisable at five cents per right.\n    The company said the rights will expire on the later of\nFebruary 17 next year or 60 days from the date they become\nexercisable. It said the plan was intended to protect\nstockholders against any attempt to take unfair advantage of\nthe recent decline in stock prices or to use abusive tactics\nsuch as market accumulations which would interfere with its\nability to maximize stockholder value.\n    The rights become exercisable if any person or group\nacquires 15 pct or more of the company's common stock other\nthan through an all cash tender offer for all outstanding\nshares at 65 dlrs per share.\n     It said the rights will also not become exercisable if the\ncompany is acquired by a group under an agreement made with its\nboard.\n     A spokeswoman told Reuters the company would have an\nofficial response to Edelman's bid by Friday, Oct 23.          \n  \n Reuter\n\u0003"
