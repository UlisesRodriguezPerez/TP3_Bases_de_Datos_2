        "BODY": "Strong south-easterly winds were\nkeeping many vessels trapped in the ice off the Finnish and\nSwedish coasts in one of the worst icy periods in the Baltic\nfor many years, the Finnish Board of Navigation said.\n    In Finland and Sweden up to 50 vessels were reported to be\nstuck in the ice, and even the largest of the assisting\nicebreakers were having difficulties in breaking through to the\nstranded ships, coastguard officials said.\n    However, icy conditions in the southern Baltic at the\nSoviet oil ports of Ventspils and Klaipeda had eased, they said.\n    Weather officials in neighbouring Sweden said the icy\nconditions in the Baltic were the worst for 30 years, with\nships fighting a losing battle to keep moving.\n    In the coastal stretches of the Gulf of Bothnia, which\ndivides Finland and Sweden, the ice is up to one metre thick,\nwith drifts and currents packing it into almost impenetrable\nwalls three metres high, Swedish coastguard officials said.\n    Weather forecasts say winds may ease during the weekend but\na further drop in temperature could bring shipping to a\nstandstill, the officials said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
