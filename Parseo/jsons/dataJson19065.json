        "DATELINE": "    BANGKOK, June 19 - ",
        "BODY": "Thailand's major tin exporter and\nproducer <Thailand Smelting and Refining Co> (Thaisarco) said\nit may be unable to meet all its overseas orders because of\ninsufficient supplies of tin concentrates from Thai mines.\n    Local mines cut combined daily tin concentrate sales to\nThaisarco, a Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD.AS> unit, to less than\n20 tonnes earlier this month from a previous 40 to 45 tonne\naverage, commercial manager Yoot Eamsa-ard told Reuters.\n    He said the cuts resulted from a government decision to let\nthe temporary business and municipal tax reductions on exported\ntin lapse on June 3.\n    The taxes, levied on the tin mines, rose to 4.4 pct this\nmonth from 1.1 pct ad valorem over the past year. The lower\nlevels had been introduced last year as a temporary move to aid\nthe tin industry after prices collapsed in late 1985.\n    Yoot said Thaisarco had to dig into its stocks to meet a\nlarge portion of new overseas orders which were averaging 100\ntonnes per day.\n    As a result, he said, Thailand could fail to fill some\n3,000 tonnes of its 19,000 tonne tin export quota allocated by\nthe Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) for the year\nending February 1988.\n    Reduced tin exports this year could cause the ATPC to\nallocate a lower quota next year, Yoot said.\n    The supplies shortage should prove temporary, however,\nbecause the Thai cabinet is expected to review a Mineral\nResources Department proposal to reinstate the low taxes late\nthis month, Yoot said.\n    The department said Thailand exported 7,715 tonnes of tin\nduring January/May compared with 8,462 tonnes a year ago.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
