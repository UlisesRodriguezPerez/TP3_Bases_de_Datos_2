        "BODY": "Wheat and rapeseed crops in east China\nsuffered considerable damage because of frost during a spell of\nunusually cold weather in late March, the China Daily said.\n    It said average temperatures for the last 10 days of March\nin most of east China were three to five degrees centigrade\nbelow average. Snow fell in Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei and Henan,\nmaking early rice sowing difficult.\n    Heavy snow blanketted central and south Jilin and north\nLiaoning, leaving farmland too muddy for spring ploughing and\nsowing, the paper said.\n    The paper said rainfall during the last 10 days of March in\nareas south of the Yangtze had been much higher than normal.\n    Heavy rain fell last Sunday in parts of Guangdong, ending a\nparticularly arid dry season and marking the start of the flood\nseason, it said. It gave no further details.\n    The New China News Agency said rain and snow in Henan had\nimproved the prospects for wheat, sown on 4.8 mln hectares, and\ncaused a drop in grain prices at rural fairs since late\nFebruary. It gave no 1986 figures for comparison.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
