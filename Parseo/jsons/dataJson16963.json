        "DATELINE": "    BANGKOK, April 21 - ",
        "BODY": "British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey\nHowe called on industrial and developing countries to combat\ntrade protectionism and remove barriers which impede free\ntrading in agricultural products.\n    Howe said in an address to the annual meeting of the U.N.\nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)\nthat success in fighting protectionism hinges on the current\nUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\n    He said Britain is committed to resisting and combatting\nprotectionism because free trade is vital to Britain where 30\npct of the gnp comes from trade in goods and services.\n    Howe urged developing countries to open up their markets,\nremove measures distorting free trade in services and provide\nprotection for intellectual property rights.\n    He said industrial nations should also adopt macro-economic\npolicies which help reduce trade imbalances and promote stable\ncurrency relationships.\n    Howe said the agricultural industry, plagued by surpluses\nand falling commodity prices in recent years, is over\nsubsidised and over protected. But the problem of farm\nsurpluses must be tackled despite the fact that it is\npolitically difficult for any government to reverse the trend\nof growing farm subsidies.\n    \"This problem of over-subsidisation and over-protection of\nagriculture will dog us in the years ahead and it will need the\nsustained application of all our energy and our imagination to\nfind solutions,\" Howe said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
