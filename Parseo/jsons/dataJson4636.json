        "BODY": "Australian beef output is forecast to\ndecline to 1.34 mln tonnes carcass weight in 1987 and 1.36 mln\nin 1988 from 1.44 mln in 1986, the Australian Meat and\nLive-Stock Corp (AMLC) said.\n    Exports of beef/veal are also predicted to decline to\n480,000 tonnes shipped weight in 1987 from 515,000 in 1986, and\nthen rally to 490,000 in 1988, the AMLC said in a summary of\nits bi-annual meat and livestock forecasts.\n    It sees cattle numbers remaining at around the 1986 level\nof 23.2 mln beasts in both years because herd rebuilding is\nexpected to be slower than previously forecast.\n    Beef producers are becoming more confident that higher\nreturns in the market, both domestically and overseas, will\ncontinue, the AMLC said.\n    The slow herd build-up and the forecast lower production is\nexpected to bring about a slight drop in both export and\ndomestic consumption this year, it said.\n    The forecast does not assume a turnaround in production\nlevels until late next year.\n    It said the outlook for beef exports as a proportion of\noutput remains much the same as last year when it was around 55\npct of total production. In 1985 it was 52 pct.\n    The increase in exports of beef as a percentage of\nproduction has mainly been attributed to the decline in the\nAustralian dollar, the AMLC said.\n    It also forecast that Australia's four major markets, the\nU.S., Japan, Canada and Taiwan, will continue to dominate the\nchilled and frozen beef export markets. They take collectively\naround 94 pct of total Australian exports.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
