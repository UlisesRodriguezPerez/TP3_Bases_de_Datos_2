        "DATELINE": "    Chicago, June 1 - ",
        "BODY": "The U.S. Court of International Trade has\nupheld the International Trade Commission's refusal to extend\ncountervailing duties on Canadian hogs to include pork\nproducts, the National Pork Producers' Council said.\n    The court's ruling came in an appeal to the Trade\nCommission's decision filed by the Pork Producers' Council.\n    Council president Tom Miller said he was disappointed by\nthe court ruling and said the council will accelerate\nactivities in support of an amendment to the 1930 Tariff Act\nthat would address the objections outlined in the Trade\nCommission's ruling.\n    The Commission had said there was insufficient economic\nintegration between the pork production industry and the pork\npacking industry to justify extending the duty on live hogs to\nfresh, chilled or frozen pork.\n    The legislation has already passed the House of\nRepresentatives and recently passed the Senate Finance\nCommittee. It is expected to be considered by the full Senate\nby the end of the summer.\n    An appeal by the Canadian Pork Council that the current\ncountervailing duty on Canadian hogs entering the U.S. be\nlifted is pending before the Court.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
