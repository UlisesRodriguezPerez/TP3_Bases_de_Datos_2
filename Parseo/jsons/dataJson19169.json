        "BODY": "There will be no serious bids at European\nCommunity open market tenders for wheat and barley until EC\nfarm ministers agree to the 1987/88 farm price package, trade\nsources said.\n    The failure of farm ministers this week to come to an\nagreement resulted in no bids at this week's tender for export\nsubsidies and traders said bids are unlikely as long as the\nuncertainty remains.\n    One trader said permanent damage to export prospects can be\navoided if an agreemend can be reached soon, but the situation\nwill become more serious as time passes.\n    However, traders said there seem to be few buyers around,\nlessening the disruptive impact of the delay.\n    Poland and South Korea, who are in the market for feed\nwheat, will be offered intervention grain through special\ntenders, traders said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
