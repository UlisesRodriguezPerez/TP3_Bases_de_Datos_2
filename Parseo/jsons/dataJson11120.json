        "BODY": "Brazilian President Jose Sarney\nannounced a move which temporarily legalises the purchase of\nU.S. dollars in the parallel currency market, aimed at\npromoting imports of foreign goods.\n    In a speech, Sarney justified his measure as a need to face\n\"current well known difficulties to obtain foreign loans for the\npurchase of goods.\"\n    The parallel market, although officially tolerated, is\ntechnically illegal in Brazil. For the past year, the dollar in\nthe parallel market has sold at between 25 and 100 pct above\nthe official rate.\n    Sarney's decision means Brazilian importers of machinery\nand industrial equipment can buy dollar currency in the\nparallel market without having to wait for an official order\nfrom the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department (Cacex).\n    Sarney also announced measures to boost exports in an\neffort to strengthen the country's trade balance and alleviate\nthe risk of a reduction of foreign loans for this sector of the\neconomy.\n    The president authorised the National Foreign Trade Council\n(CONEX) to resume operating as the ruling body of Brazil's\ntrade policy, with participation of the private sector.\n    The Council had been closed three years ago by the military\ngovernment of former President Joao Figueiredo.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
