        "BODY": "An American Farm Bureau\nFederation (AFBF) official said that far from hurting Canadian\ncorn producers, U.S. farm programs benefit all foreign\nproducers.\n    AFBF president Dean Kleckner made the comments in response\nto the ruling earlier today by the Canadian Import Tribunal\nthat subsidized U.S. corn imports were injurious to Canadian\ngrowers. The tribunal upheld a countervailing duty of 84.9 U.S.\ncents a bushel.\n    \"Farm Bureau specialists went to Ottawa and testified\nprevious U.S. farm programs have actually benefited all foreign\nproducers by reducing the amount of corn grown in the U.S. (and\nlosing market share), while exerting an upward influence on the\nprice of corn Worldwide,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
