        "BODY": "European Community agriculture\nministers will meet tomorrow evening, after the end of a\ntwo-day summit meeting of heads of government, to again attempt\nto agree a 1987/88 farm price package, an EC Commission\nspokesman said.\n    He added that tomorrow's EC Official Journal will contain\nnotice of special agricultural measures of a purely technical\nnature which will come into effect on July 1 unless the\nministers reach an accord.\n    The spokesman declined to detail these special measures but\nsaid they would not be the sort of \"dynamic\" moves which EC Farm\nCommissioner Frans Andriessen has said he would take in the\ncase of complete deadlock among farm ministers.\n    These moves would be taken only if tomorrow's meeting of\nministers in Brussels again fails to reach an accord, EC\nsources said.\n    Andriessen is thought to be prepared to cut cereals prices\nby seven pct and to take other drastic action, trade sources\nsaid.\n    EC farm ministers ended their last meeting on June 18 still\nsplit over the Commission's proposal for a tax on vegetable and\nmarine oils and fats.\n    In addition, West Germany said it would veto plans for\ncereal price cuts and for a change in the green currency\nsystem.\n    Earlier today, diplomats said Belgium, the current holder\nof the European Community presidency, appears ready to drop the\nplans for the controversial oils and fats tax.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
