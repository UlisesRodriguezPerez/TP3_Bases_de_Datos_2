        "BODY": "Stocks of paper and lumber producers\ntumbled as a rumor spread that the Japanese may impose tariffs\non wood and paper products, analysts and industry officials\nsaid. But, they said, logic and their own research do not\nsupport the rumors.\n    \"Apparently a rumor is floating around trading circles\nabout the Japanese doing something about tariffs on wood and\npaper products,\" Lowell Moholt, director of investor relations\nat Weyerhaeuser Co said. \"And we can only assume that this\nrumor is one of the factors hurting the stocks.\"\n    \"I have talked to many people, some with government\ncontacts, and most of them have been mystified by the rumor,\"\nsaid Moholt.\n    Nevertheless, International Paper <IP> fell 4-3/8 to\n95-1/2, Weyerhaeuser Co <WY> two to 51-1/2, Potlatch Corp <PCH>\n3-1/2 to 69, Great Northern Nekoosa <GNN> 3-1/8 to 85-1/2,\nTemple Inland Inc <TIN> 2-3/4 to 57-1/4, Boise Cascade 2-3/8 to\n74-3/8, Georgia Pacific Corp <GP> 1-1/2 to 43-3/4, Champion\nInternational Corp <CHA> 1-3/8 to 36-1/2 and Pope and Talbot\nInc <POP> 1/2 to 36.\n    \"My sources told me there is no grain of truth to the\nJapanese imposing tariffs,\" Sherman Chao, analyst with Salomon\nInc said. \"The realities and the logic do not support these\nrumors,\" he said.\n    \"The Japanese have a lot more to lose by imposing tariffs.\nThey are running a trade surplus,\" he said, \"and if they\nstarted a trade war it would hurt them more than the U.S.\"\n    Chao said that U.S. producers annually export about two\nbillion dlrs of forest products to Japan. \"Three quarters of\nthat is in the form of wood products, meaning logs, wood chips\nand lumber, and the balance is paper products.\"\n    \"They (the Japanese) don't have any domestic sources to\nmake up for the restrictions,\" Chao said, \"so it's not like\nthey would put a tariff to protect their own industry.\"\n    \"The rumors do no make economic sense, and I am skeptical,\"\nanalyst Mark Rogers of Prudential Bache Securities said, \"but\npolitics has been known to override economic concerns.\"\n     Speculation has surfaced on Wall Street recently that the\nJapanese would take action to retaliate against tariffs the\nReagan Administration imposed last Friday on Japanese\nelectronics products.\n    Rogers said the rumor fueled the profit taking that was\nalready occuring in these stocks. \"In a nervous market, people\ntend to take profits, and they tend to take profits that have\nbeen the biggest gainers lately.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
