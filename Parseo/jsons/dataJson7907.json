        "BODY": "Japan has agreed to drop barriers to\nAmerican-caught herring and pollock, opening the way for\nshipments that could reach 300 mln dlrs annually, U.S. Trade\nRepresentative Clayton Yeutter announced.\n    Yeutter said the accord was reached after extensive\nbilateral negotiations that ended earlier today in Tokyo.\n    He said the Commerce Department estimated U.S. shipments of\nprocessed pollock products and herring should rise to 85 mln\ndlrs this year and to more than 300 mln dlrs annually in later\nyears.\n    There was no immediate assessment of the value of current\nU.S. shipments, but officials said the pact would lift quotas\nto the point that Americans would be able to ship nearly all\nthe pollock and herring ordered by Japanese firms.\n    At the same time, Yeutter said Washington was temporarily\nsuspending a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs\nand Trade (GATT) that Japan was unfairly curbing imports of the\ntwo fish.\n    He said the complaint would be reviewed later this year\nafter an assessment to see if Japan lived up to the agreement.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
