        "BODY": "U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard\nLyng said the Reagan administration had not decided on offering\nthe Soviet Union subsidized wheat but that such an offer had\nnot been ruled out.\n    In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also said that he had no\nknowledge of any upcoming discussion of the matter within the\ncabinet.\n    Asked if the administration had ruled out offering to\nsubsidize wheat exports to the Soviet Union under the\ndepartment's export enhancement program, Lyng said, \"No. We\nhaven't made a decision on it, haven't even talked about it,\nhaven't even looked at it.\"\n    Reminded that there have been reports that Moscow would buy\nU.S. wheat if competitively priced, Lyng responded, \"If they\n(the Soviets) would offer to buy some wheat, would we accept\nit? It would depend on what price they offered.\"\n    Lyng added that he did not think the price of U.S. wheat\nwas far off the world price.\n    Asked about persistent speculation that the administration\nwould offer Moscow a wheat subsidy, Lyng said, \"Some people\nthink they're doing it to see if they can get a little spurt in\nthe market.\"\n    Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz last week asked\nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission to investigate reports\nthat wheat prices were being manipulated by reports that a U.S.\nwheat subsidy offer was imminent.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
