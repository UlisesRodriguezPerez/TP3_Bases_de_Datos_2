        "BODY": "Western agricultural attaches in Moscow\nsaid they had no evidence to substantiate rumours that last\nApril's Chernobyl nuclear disaster had a worse effect on Soviet\ngrain than first reported.\n    Current Soviet interest in chartering ships to carry grain\nfrom the U.S. Helped prompt the rumours on world markets. But\nthe diplomats said they had seen no reports in the state press\nand heard no comments from officials to substantiate them.\n    The official media was initially slow in reporting the\naccident but, under Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev's campaign\nfor openness, gradually gave more and more details.\n    Land around the nuclear plant was contaminated to varying\ndegrees. Some is now being used to grow industrial crops\ninstead of grain.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
