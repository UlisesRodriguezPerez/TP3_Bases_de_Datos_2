        "BODY": "Valero Natural Gas Partners\nLP, 49 pct owned by Valero Energy Corp <VLO>, said a jury in\nSutton County, Texas, district court has found that it had no\nliability for 21 mln dlrs in take-or-pay claims that had been\nalleged by Lively Exploration Co.\n    Take-or-pay claims involve allegations that natural gas\nsupply contracts require volume of natural gas to be paid for\neven if not taken. As a result of declining markets, most\npipelines, like Valero, do not have customers for all the gas\nthat could be delivered by producers, such as Lively.\n    Valero said it used as its primary defense the Texas\nRailroad Commission's rules that require intrastate pipelines\nto take ratably from their producers and in times of surplus\ntake gas in accordance with priority categories set by the\ncommission.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
