        "BODY": "Norway's central bank sold crowns in the\nopen market in a bid to ease strong upward pressure on the\ncurrency, which threatens to rise above set levels in a basket\nof currencies, dealers said.\n    The central bank declined comment, but dealers noted the\nbank had also intervened and sold small amounts of crowns on\nFriday. The bank is committed to defending the crown at certain\nlevels in a basket of 14 trade-weighted currencies.\n    \"They've been in again this morning, selling piecemeal\nwhenever they think necessary,\" a senior dealer at an Oslo bank,\nwho declined to be identified, told Reuters.\n    The crown's index is currently around 109.60 in the basket\n-- close to its upper limit of 109.50 which the central bank is\ncommitted to defending.\n    A low index figure indicates a high value for the crown.\nThe limit at the other end of the scale is set at 114.50.\n    The crown has been bolstered by high Norwegian interest\nrates, currently around 16 pct in the money market, and better\nthan expected economic indicators which showed a sharply\nreduced foreign trade deficit in May and inflation stabilising\naround the current annual rate of 10 pct.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
