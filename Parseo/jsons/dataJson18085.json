        "DATELINE": "    STOCKHOLM, June 2 - ",
        "BODY": "The current crude oil price of between\n18 and 20 dlrs a barrel will remain stable over the next couple\nof years, rising only one to two dlrs a barrel per annum to\nkeep up with inflation, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said.\n    Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish trade\nofficials, said the stable price depended upon output restraint\nby both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish government\nofficials said.\n    They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, made\nthe remarks whilst talking about the connection between Third\nWorld debt and industrialised nations.\n    Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher\nenergy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said.\n    Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around the\nbeginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrial\ncountries that depend on imported energy, they would only lead\nto wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, he\nsaid.\n    This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely high\nprices, he added.\n    Sweden, heavily dependent on imported oil, suffered a major\ncrisis in the mid-1970s, when oil prices spiralled.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
