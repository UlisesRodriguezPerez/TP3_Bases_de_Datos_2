Asamera\nsaid the mine produced 116,514 ounces of gold in 1986 and is\nexpected to produce 130,000 to 140,000 ounces this year.\n    Asamera said its talks with Breakwater Resources Ltd\n<BWRLF> on a possible merger of mining interests, including the\nCannon mine, have been terminated. It did not elaborate.\n     \n    Asamera said holding all its mineral properties in a\nseparate company will give better and more direct recognition\nto the value of the assets.\n    Its other mining interests include gold exploration\nprospects on 13,000 acres in Inyo County, Calif., and 500,000\nacres in Canada's Northwest Territories, the Gooseberry gold\nand silver mine in Nevada, chromite properties in northern\nCalifornia and Newfoundland, and a platinum prospect in the\nRankin Inlet, Northwest Territories.\n                                                               \n        \n Reuter\n\u0003"
