        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, June 18 - ",
        "BODY": "Britain's Defence Minister George Younger\nsaid the U.S. Was unfairly protecting its defence industry, and\nthis could lead to British firms demanding counter-measures.\n    Younger told a U.S. Chamber of Commerce meeting that U.S.\nLegislators were failing to realise \"the true nature of the\ntwo-way street in terms of ideas, technology and equipment.\n    A British parliamentary report said that up to March\nBritish firms had been awarded just 34 mln dlrs worth of\ncontracts for the Strategic Defence Initiative, compared with\nthe 1.5 billion dlrs Britain had hoped to secure.\n    The committee said U.S. Technology export restrictions and\n\"selectiveness\" towards foreign contractors had denied British\ncompetitors more lucrative orders and largely excluded them\nfrom technological research for SDI.\n    Younger said London had given U.S. Companies contracts\nunder conditions of fair and open competition. \"All we ask is\nfor our companies to be given similar opportunities,\" he added.\n    If new American legislation aimed at curbing unfair\nsubsidies was used to exclude foreign suppliers it would not be\nsurprising if British firms pressed for retaliatory measures,\nYounger said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
