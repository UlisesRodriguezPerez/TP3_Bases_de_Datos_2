        "BODY": "Ecuador will ask OPEC to raise its oil\nexport quota by 100,000 barrels per day to 310,000 to\ncompensate for lost output due to last week's earthquake,\ndeputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite said.\n    Santos Alvite, who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss\nan aid plan for Ecuador, did not say when the Organisation of\nPetroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be approached.\n    The additional output would be related to plans now under\ndiscussion for Venezuela and Mexico to lend Ecuador crude while\nit repairs a pipeline damaged by the quake.\n    Earlier, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Aturo\nHernandez Grisanti said his country would supply an unspecified\npart of Ecuador's export commitments.\n    But Santos Alvite told reporters he hoped a first cargo of\n300,000 barrels could leave Maracaibo this weekend to supply\nrefineries near Guayaquil. He added Ecuador also wanted to make\nup for 50,000 bpd it shipped to Caribbean destinations. Mexico\nmight supply Ecuador's South Korean market.\n    Ecuador may be unable to export oil for up to five months\ndue to extensive damage to a 25 mile stretch of pipeline\nlinking jungle oilfields to the Pacific port of Balao.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
