        "BODY": "The Senate unanimously approved\nlegislation to lift a ban on new construction of natural\ngas-fired power plants and other large industrial gas-burning\nplants.\n    The bill, sponsored by Senate Energy Committee chairman\nBennett Johnston, also repeals mandatory incremental pricing of\nnatural gas which was designed to protect residential consumers\nfrom major price increases by forcing some industrial users to\npay higher than market prices.\n    \"This legislation will open up new natural gas markets,\" the\nLousiana Democrat said.\n    The gas restrictions were enacted in 1978 in response to a\nshortage of natural gas and predictions of higher prices.\n    \"Now both oil and gas prices are severely depressed,\"\nJohnston said.\n    In a compromise with coal producers, the bill requires new\nbaseload electric powerplants be designed to accomodate\nmodifications necessary to burning coal or another alternate\nfuel.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
