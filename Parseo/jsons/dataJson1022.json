        "TITLE": "CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S.",
        "DATELINE": "    PEKING, March 3 - ",
        "BODY": "China called on the United States to\nremove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading\nstatus and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.\n    But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing\n13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are\ninaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade\nCongress to change laws which limit its exports.\n    The official International Business newspaper today\npublished China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the\nvisit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.\n    \"It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its\nrestrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities\nfor them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese\nexports,\" the editorial said.\n    \"The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against\nfavourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China\ninto the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).\n    \"Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in\nrecent years, control of them is still extremely strict and\ninfluences normal trade between the two countries,\" it added.\n    The paper also printed an article by China's commercial\ncounsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said\nthat \"all kinds of difficulties and restrictions\" were preventing\nbilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.\n    He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on\ntechnology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
