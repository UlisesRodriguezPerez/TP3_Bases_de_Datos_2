        "BODY": "West German Economics Minister Martin\nBangemann urged a halt to the talking down of the dollar by\nboth official and private institutions in the U.S., Saying calm\nwas needed on the foreign exchanges.\n    Speaking at the opening of the 40th Hanover Industry Fair,\nBangemann said radical changes in foreign exchange parities had\nleft their mark on exports and investments. He added that\nwithout these external difficulties, West Germany's economy\nwould have grown by 3.5 pct last year instead of the 2.5 pct\nreported.\n    Bangemann said he could not deny that the economic climate\nin West Germany had cooled, but he stressed the country was not\nin a downtrend.\n    The minister also criticised state subsidies, which he said\nmainly favoured large companies and created a tax burden for\nsmaller and medium sized firms.\n    Bangemann referred specifically to subsidies in the steel\nindustry, which he said had to be fought with all legal means\nwhen they did not correspond to European Community guidelines\non grants.\n    He added that in light of the declining demand for steel\ncapacities had to be adjusted, saying the Bonn government would\nnot successfully be able to stand in the way of any change in\nthis industry.\n    Bangemann also spoke out against protectionism and called\nfor more competition, citing as an example the Federal Post\nOffice.\n    The Post Office enjoys a monopoly in West Germany,\nespecially as far as deciding who is able to provide\ntelecommunications equipment.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
