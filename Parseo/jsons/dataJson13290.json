        "BODY": "Indonesian Energy minister Subroto said\nhe was very confident of continued stability in the oil market\nbecause of the determination of Opec members to maintain a\nprice of 18 dlrs a barrel.\n    \"We are very confident that things will continue this way.\nThe short-term outlook is favourable because of the resolution\nof Opec to stick to the 18 dlr price,\" he said at a signing\nceremony for a new Indonesian production sharing agreement.\n    He said Opec output continued to remain slightly under its\nagreed ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels, and he expected prices to\nfirm slightly in the third quarter of the year.\n    He said at Opec's next meeting in Vienna in June, members\nwill face the choice of either maintaining present volume and\nseeing prices rise a bit, or raising the production ceiling so\nthat members could produce more in the third and fourth\nquarters of 1987.\n    He gave no figures for how much he thought volume could be\nraised without undermining the 18 dlr target, or any indication\nof which option he preferred.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
