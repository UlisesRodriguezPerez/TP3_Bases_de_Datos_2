        "BODY": "Pitt-Des Moines Inc said it will\nreceive a qualified opinion from auditors on its 1986 and 1985\nfinancial statements.\n    It said the qualification related to its inability to\ndetermine the effects, if any, of the final resolution of a\nsuit filed against it by <Washington Public Power Supply\nSystem>.  The 1985 suit was dismissed in a 1986 lower court\naction, but the ultimate outcome of the matter is still\nuncertain since Washington Public Power has appealed to the\nU.S. Court of Appeals.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
