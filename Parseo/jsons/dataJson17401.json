        "BODY": "A 0.4 pct rise in the March U.S. index\nof leading indicators points to continued moderate U.S. real\neconomic growth, economists said.\n    \"The report is consistent with a modestly growing economy,\"\nsaid Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc. \"The\neconomy is not robust, but we're not heading into a recession\neither.\"\n    \"The report suggests more of the same: continued moderate\ngrowth,\" said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Government and Co\nInc. \"The gain was mostly in stock prices. There was no change\nin the fundamental movement of the economy.\"\n    The Commerce Department said that higher stock prices led\nthe March gain. Unemployment claims, vendor performance,\ncontracts and orders for plant and equipment, manufacturers'\norders, and building permits also were positive.\n    The average workweek, raw materials prices, and money\nsupply detracted from the index.\n    Economists noted that the index signals the direction but\nnot the magnitude of changes in gross national product.\n    \"You can't derive profound conclusions on the economy from\nthe report,\" McCarthy said. \"The link between leading\nindicators and the economy is not strong.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
