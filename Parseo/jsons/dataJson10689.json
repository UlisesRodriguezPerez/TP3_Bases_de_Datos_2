        "BODY": "Japan is becoming dangerously isolated\nagain as the U.S. And Europe feel they have been cheated by\nJapanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth,\nofficials and businessmen from around the world said.\n    As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen,\nmaking Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments\ngrit their teeth harder, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said\nthere was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise.\n    The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by\nboth sides over the key Maekawa report of April, last year.\n    The document was prepared by a private committee formed by\nPrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of\nJapan head Haruo Maekawa. It recommended that to stop friction\ndue to its large trade surpluses, Japan must \"make a historical\ntransformation in its traditional policies on economic\nmanagement and the nation's lifestyle. There can be no further\ndevelopment for Japan without this transformation.\"\n    Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have\nlooked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But the\nJapanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium term\nprospects of totally transforming their economic habits.\n    The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese\nprevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended to\nraise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to\nthe U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral\nsemiconductor pact.\n    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to\nblock Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese\nplaced what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid\nby British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic\ntelecommunications joint venture.\n    On Friday, European currency dealers said European central\nbanks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, might\nleave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen.\n    Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business group\nKeidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory\nviews last November when he visited the European Community.\n\"Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that I\nfound to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe\nwas the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the\nresults of the Maekawa report,\" he said.\n    \"We explained that the process of restructuring the economy\naway from its dependence on exports toward a balance between\ndomestic and external demand...Would take time,\" Saito said.\n    Saito's words were ignored. In February, EC Industrial\nPolicy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said \"I\nonly know that your government, under the leadership of\nMaekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less\noutward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa\nreport which has attracted the most attention in Europe.\"\n    And Europeans and Americans want quick action. \"A far better\nanswer than protectionism would be structural change within the\nJapanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And\nwe hope to see changes occur in the near future,\" visiting\nChairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March.\n    Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the\nfault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea of\nchange in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials.\n    Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business\nleaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade\nproblem.\n    \"We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the\nMaekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,\"\nsaid EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock.\n    \"The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it\nis finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their\nlabour,\" said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of\nShearson Lehman Brothers.\n    Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance.\n    Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as\nfast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled\nthe country asking about this issue.\n    He said People mentioned many things in line with the\nspirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and\nsteel industries.\n    A major misunderstanding is that the private report was\ngovernment policy. Europeans are confused about this,\nunderlined by von Moltke's reference to the \"leadership\" of the\nMaekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to last\nSeptember's government programme of new economic measures.\n\"Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point out\nthat the government has put its signature to a programme\ndesigned to implement the report,\" the ambassador said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
