        "BODY": "Japanese importers bought some 95,000\ntonnes of Chinese soybeans late last month for May to September\nshipment, under the semi-annual trade accords, trade sources\nsaid.\n    The FOB premium rose to 13.50 dlrs per tonne, up 2.50 dlrs\nfrom the premium for the November to April shipment, but down\nfrom 13.80 for the last May to September shipment.\n    Flat prices for Chinese beans are based on futures prices\nin Chicago plus the FOB premium.\n    Japanese purchases of Chinese soybeans, including spot\nbuying, may have totalled 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes of the 1986\ncrop for November to April 1987 shipment, down from some\n300,000 tonnes the previous year, the sources said.\n    Domestic demand for edible-use soybeans is expected to\nremain stable at about 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes a year, the\nsources said.\n    In recent years Japanese importers have overbought Chinese\nedible-use soybeans and sold the surplus to domestic crushers,\nbut low 1986 U.S. Crop prices have discouraged the purchase of\nChinese origin beans for crushing, they said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
