        "TITLE": "OPEC DIFFERENTIALS NOT SEEN POSING MAJOR PROBLEMS",

        "BODY": "Some OPEC states are unhappy about the\nprices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose\ngreat problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price\nand output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say.\n    They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference\npresidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances\nabout price differentials making some of their crudes\nuncompetitive.\n    There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that\nOPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes,\nto correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.\n    But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price\ndifferentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market\nsignals of a dent in OPEC's new unity.\n    \"All OPEC members can make a good case for changing\ndifferentials,\" said one analyst with a major oil company. \"But\nat the end of the day, the attitude is going to be \"leave well\nalone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered.\"\n    Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw\nsales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished\ncustomer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,\nmarketing incentives have helped their sales.\n    Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by\nmeans of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside\nbetter priced grades in a \"package.\"\n    Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least\nfor some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should\nchange prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for\nfuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At\nits last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed\nprices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference\npoint. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985\nwhen members offered discounts to attract customers.\n    OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8\nmln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter\nand 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend\nor raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.\n    Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not\nmirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr\ntarget and at most make minimal changes to differentials,\nanalysts say.\n    The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one\nnon-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export\ncrudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.\nExtra heavy crudes were among those left out.\n    Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil\nexports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say\nonly one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at\nofficial prices, with some of the rest included in processing\nor barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.\n    Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,\nwhen some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to\npay the new prices.\n   Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude\n-- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --\nwas uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.\n    In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below\nits 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,\ndue partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has\nrisen.\n    Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say\nits price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.\n    But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort\nGrieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the\ndifferentials question in Vienna.\n    \"It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which\nholds the presidency, raised the issue,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
