        "BODY": "Clevite Industries Inc, which\nearlier received a 96 mln dlr takeover offer from J.P.\nIndustries Inc <JPI>, said it amended its Shareholder Rights\nPlan so that certain provisions of the plan cannot occur until\nthe board determines that it is in the best interests of the\ncompany and stockholders.\n    The plan, adopted in December 1986, permits Clevite to\nissue shares at half price to existing stockholders and allows\nstockholders to buy shares of an unfriendly bidder at half\nprice.\n    Clevite said the amendments by its board effectively mean\nthat the so-called flip-in and flip-over provisions of its\nrights plan can only be triggered by affirmative board\napproval.\n    The company said it acted inview of the proposed\nacquisition and because certain debt restrictions could block\nits ability to redeem the rights.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
