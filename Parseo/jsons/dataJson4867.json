        "BODY": "Brazil's state-oil company\nPetrobras has asked the Army to withdraw the troops which were\noccupying its oil installations since Tuesday, Petrobras said\nin a statement.\n    The statement said the request for the withdrawal of the\ntroops was made because of the calmness reigning in all of its\nrefineries.\n    \"The request was also due to the end of the seamen's strike\nand the willingness of the oil industry workers to sit again by\nthe negotiating table,\" the statement said.\n    Even though the Petrobras statement said the seamen's\nstrike was over, a union spokesman said only two small shipping\ncompanies had reached a pay agreement. The overwhelming\nmajority of Brazil's seamen remained on strike.\n    The statement said a meeting between Petrobras and oil\nindustry leaders was set for next Wednesday in Rio, with the\npresence of Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto as a mediator.\n    Petrobras said the request for the withdrawal of the troops\nwas made at 1100 local hours (1400 GMT), but a company\nspokesman said he did not know if the troops had already been\nremoved.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
