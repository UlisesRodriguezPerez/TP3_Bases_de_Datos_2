The high water was expected to recede within two days to\nbelow levels at which the restrictions come into force.\n    Traffic was halted briefly late Tuesday night, Wednesday\nand parts of Thursday on stretches of the Rhine between Bonn\nand Koblenz but the shipping bans were lifted, the officials\nsaid. Shipping is now permitted on all parts of the West German\nsection of the Rhine, with restrictions in some areas.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
