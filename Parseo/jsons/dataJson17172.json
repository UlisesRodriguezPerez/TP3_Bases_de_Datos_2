        "BODY": "Britain can look forward to fairly\nstrong economic growth, falling interest rates and firm\nSterling, Barclays Bank Plc chairman-elect John Quinton said.\n    \"We should see a reasonable decline in interest rates in\nthe next few months, but not a great one and not a rapid one,\"\nQuinton told a press luncheon.\n    He said that whereas the British economy is growing at\nabout three pct, he expects only \"minor\" growth for the western\nindustrialized world as a whole. But, unless there is a major\nmove toward protectionism, there should be no need to worry\nabout a recession in the next two or three years.\n    Quinton said much will depend on the resolution of trade\ndisputed between the United States and Japan.\n    He said Tokyo, in resisting the appreciation of the yen,\nhad been \"holding back the laws of economics.\" But if the\ndollar has to fall further to reduce Japan's trade surplus, he\nsaid he hoped the fall would be slow rather than rapid.\n    Quinton said it will be difficult for the City of London to\nstave off the creation of a powerful securities industry\nregulatory body along the lines of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission in the U.S., especially if there are more insider\ntrading scandals and if the Labour Party wins the next U.K.\nelection.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
