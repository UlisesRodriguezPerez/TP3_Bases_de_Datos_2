        "DATELINE": "    STAMFORD, Conn, April 13 - ",
        "BODY": "GTE Corp said the decline in its\nfirst quarter net income reflects a 121 mln dlr loss from its\n50 pct share ownership of U.S. Sprint's operations.\n    This loss is an increase from the 60 mln dlrs loss reported\non operations GTE owned a year ago quarter and prior to\nentering a joint venture with United Telecommunications <UT> in\nJuly 1986. Under the joint venture, each company owns 50 pct of\nSprint.\n    Earlier, the company reported net income declined to 265.0\nmln dlrs from 283.0 mln dlrs in the first quarter a year ago.\n    Theodore Brophy, chairman of GTE said, \"we expect US\nSprint's losses to diminish later this year as customer traffic\nmigrates to the new fiber-optic network for long distance\ntelecommunications.\n    The reason for the higher losses reflect lower prices as\nwell as higher operating costs related, in part, to the\nfraudalent use of the network.\n    Operating income of its telephone operations, which account\nfor 91 pct of the total, rose eight pct to 736.0 mln dlrs. \nRevenues from telephone operations rose eight pct to 2.9\nbillion dlrs.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
