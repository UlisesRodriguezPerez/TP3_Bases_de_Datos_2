        "DATELINE": "    BRUSSELS, March 19 - ",
        "BODY": "The European Community Commission has\ndecided to abolish a special tax of eight Ecus per tonne\nimposed on exports of Spanish maize, Commission sources said.\n    They said the tax, which applies to Spanish sales to EC and\nnon-EC countries alike, would no longer be required on exports\nfrom Spanish ports south of Valencia.\n    The decision was taken at a meeting of the authority's\ncereals management committee today.\n    The tax had been introduced last September at the same time\nas a subsidy of eight Ecus per tonne was brought in for exports\nof maize to Spain from other EC member countries.\n    The aim of the tax was to prevent the maize imported into\nSpain from the other EC states with the help of subsidies from\nbeing reexported back to them.\n    The sources added that Spain had received no answer from\nthe committee to its request that tenders be opened for the\nsale to third countries of 450,000 tonnes of maize.\n    The request will be considered at the committee's next\nmeeting, the commission sources said.\n    Madrid estimates that it needs to import 1.7 mln tonnes of\nmaize this year, while an EC-U.S. accord guarantees non-EC\nproducer sales to Spain of two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000\ntonnes of sorghum annually for the next four years.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
