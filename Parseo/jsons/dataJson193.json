        "BODY": "The U.S. Agriculture Department\nprobably will not offer a two dlr per bushel bonus payment to\ncorn farmers for any erodible cropland they enrolled in the\nconservation reserve program last year, an aide to USDA\nSecretary Richard Lyng said.\n    Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) said yesterday that Lyng had\nindicated he would consider giving those farmers the same two\ndlr bonus offered corn farmers who are signing up for the 1987\nprogram this month.\n    But the aide to Lyng said it was doubtful that the\ndepartment would offer a retroactive bonus to farmers who\nenrolled land in the 10-year conservation reserve last year.\n    \"How are you going to stop the tide,\" he said, referring to\ndemands that would follow from other commodity groups.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
