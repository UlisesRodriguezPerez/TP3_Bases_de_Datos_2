        "BODY": "The United States wants Taiwan's\ncurrency to appreciate faster to reduce Taiwan's trade surplus\nwith the U.S., A senior trade official said.\n    Board of Foreign Trade director Vincent Siew told reporters\non Saturday U.S. Officials told him in Washington last week\nthat unless Taiwan allowed its dollar to rise faster it would\nface retaliation.\n    Siew returned from Washington on Friday after the U.S\nresponded to Taiwan's request to increase its textile export\nquotas by promising further talks in May. Taiwan's surplus with\nthe U.S. Hit a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1986.\n    Washington signed a three-year accord with Taipei last year\nlimiting textile export growth to 0.5 pct a year.\n    Siew said the Taiwan dollar had risen by about 15 pct\nagainst the U.S. Dollar since September 1985.\n    It surged last week amid indications Washington was seeking\na major rise in its value. It rose four cents against the U.S.\nDollar on Saturday to close at 34.59.\n    Western trade sources told Reuters Taiwan and the U.S. Have\nbeen holding talks on the currency issue but added it is not\nclear how far Washington wants to see the Taiwan dollar rise.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
