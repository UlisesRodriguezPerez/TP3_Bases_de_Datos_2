        "BODY": "Ecuador is due to resume limited crude oil\noutput on May 8 when a new 43 km pipeline to neighbouring\nColombia should be finished, an energy ministry spokesman said.\n    Oil output was halted on March 5 by an earthquake which\ndamaged 50 km of the main pipeline linking jungle oilfields at\nLago Agrio to the Ecuadorean port of Balao on the Pacific.\n    About 13 km of the new link, capable of carrying some\n50,000 barrels per day (bpd), has been built, he said.\n    Ecuador pumped 245,000 to 250,000 bpd before the\nearthquake.\n    The new link will connect Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon in\nColombia, the starting point of Columbia's pipeline to the\nPacific ocean port of Temuco.\n    The government estimates it will take about four more\nmonths to repair the Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline and return\noutput to normal levels, the spokesman said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
