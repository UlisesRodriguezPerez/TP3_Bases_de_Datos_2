        "BODY": "Australia's current account deficit for\nFebruary is expected to narrow to a range of between 700 mln\nand one billion dlrs, from the unrevised January level of 1.29\nbillion, market economists polled by Reuters said.\n    Statistics Bureau February figures are out tomorrow.\n    The economists said a key element in the narrowing would be\na reversal of the drop in exports which took place in January,\nafter a sharp rise in December when the deficit was only 598\nmln dlrs.\n    As an example they quoted wheat export volume, which rose\nabout 30 pct in February after dropping as much in January.\n    A lack of aircraft imports in February should also\ncontribute on the trade account although it is still likely to\nremain in deficit, the economists said.\n    Other positive influences on the current account balance\nshould be a decline in the invisibles deficit following a\nseasonal fall in interest payments and the dropping out of\ncertain official aid payments, they said.\n    They said the Australian dollar, which last week touched an\neight-month high of 0.6900 U.S. Dlrs but is now around the\n0.6800 level, should not react adversely to the figures unless\nthe current account shortfall tops one billion dlrs.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
