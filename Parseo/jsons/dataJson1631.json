        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 4 - ",
        "BODY": "The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee\napproved a measure that would exempt farmers who planted\nalfalfa or other multiyear grasses and legumes between 1981 and\n1985 from a federal conservation requirement.\n    Sen. Edward Zorinsky, D-Neb., said his bill would restore\nequity under federal sodbuster rules, which currently deny farm\nprogram benefits to farmers who, between 1981 and 1985, planted\nalfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes without\ninterrupting the plantings with a row crop.\n    An official from a leading conservation group, who asked\nnot to be identified, said the panel's move was \"an unfortunate\nfirst action\" because it could lead to the exemption of\npotentially millions of acres from the sod buster regulations,\nestablished under the 1985 farm bill.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
