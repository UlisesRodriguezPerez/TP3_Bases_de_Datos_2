        "BODY": "Long delays at the railway crossing on\nthe Kenyan border have led Uganda to re-route its coffee\nexports through a ferry link with the Kenyan port of Kisumu\nacross Lake Victoria, Ugandan officials based in Kenya said.\n    Uganda has a direct rail link with the Kenyan port of\nMombasa through which it conducts 70 pct of its external trade\nbut there is a chronic shortage of railway wagons, they said.\n    Customs at Kisumu take less than a day compared with two to\nthree at the Malaba rail border crossing, a Ugandan Railways\nofficial said. \"Malaba is now handling only 10 pct of the trade\nand all the coffee and oil goes through Kisumu,\" he said.\n    However, an accident recently damaged the wagon ferry which\nplies between Kisumu and the Ugandan port of Jinja, causing\nbottlenecks on the lake route too.\n    Sources at the Coffee Marketing Board in Kampala reported\ndelays in coffee export shipments last January due to\ncongestion on the lake ferries.\n    Coffee accounts for about 95 pct of Uganda's export\nearnings and last November President Yoweri Museveni ordered\nall coffee shipments to be carried by rail in order to avoid\nthe higher costs of road haulage.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
