        "BODY": "The U.S. Feedgrains Council is\nsurprised and disappointed by the Canadian Import Tribunal's\ndecision that imports of corn from the U.S. are materially\ninjuring Canadian corn producers, a council spokesman said.\n    \"At a time when the world is attempting to liberalize trade\nin the new rounnd of multilateral negotiations, it is\nincomprehensible that a country that stands to gain so much\nfrom the reduction in agricultural trade barriers would\nthreaten that process by caving in to pressures for\nprotectionism,\" council president Darwin E. Stolte said.\n    Canada's finding will strain the U.S./Canadian trading\nrelationship, could damage the future of U.S. feedgrains \nsupport for the free trade negotiations, and also negatively\nimpact farm trade reform with other nations, the council said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
