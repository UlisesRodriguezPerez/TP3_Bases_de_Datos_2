        "BODY": "Canada has threatened to stop imports\nof Danish pigmeat from July 14 after Canadian veterinary\ninspectors approved only two of 33 slaughterhouses, a Danish\nagriculture ministry official told Reuters.\n    The Canadians postponed the original July 1 deadline at the\nrequest of the European Commission, which Denmark approached\nfor support.\n    Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said in an\ninterview with the daily Berlingske Tidende: \"Denmark will not\naccept a ban on Danish meat exports, and I am sure we can reach\nan understanding with the Canadians with the help of the EC.\"\n    Danish pigmeat exports to Canada were worth 106 mln crowns\nin 1986, while Canadian exports to the European Community\ntotalled about 6.5 billion U.S. Dlrs.\n    Some Danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicion\nthat the Canadian action was in response to tightening up by EC\nveterinary inspectors on Canadian food exports to the EC.\n    But an official at the Canadian embassy in Copenhagen said\nthe inspection of Danish slaughterhouses was based on EC\nregulations. \"Canadian officials are very concerned about the\ntrade implications. We are holding active discussions with the\nEC and bilaterally,\" she added.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
