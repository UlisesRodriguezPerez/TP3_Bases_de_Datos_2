        "BODY": "Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf like\nbeacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night.\n    One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield,\nwas all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday.\n    The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel and\nconcrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60\nmetres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S.\nDestroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it.\n    The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section\nof the structure remained.\n    U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an\nAmerican helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S.\nforces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said had\nbeen caught laying mines.\n    But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defense\nofficials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm\nmissiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday\nand the Sea Isle City on Friday.\n    Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, a\nkey backer of Iraq in its war with Iran.\n    Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East\nnow with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti\ntankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping.\n    But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level\nof violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result\nof U.S. intervention and Iran's response.\n    The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a\nU.S. \"tit-for-tat\" policy that gave Iran the initiative, said\nHarlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS.\n    He said with this appraoch America would suffer \"the death\nof one thousand cuts.\"\n    But for the United States to grab the initiative\nmilitarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's\nharbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its\nshipping must pass, Schuler said.\n    He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing\nIran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off,\nTehran could not continue the war with Iraq.\n    Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic\ninitiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an\narms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.\n    He said the United States should also threaten to mine and\nblockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to\nacknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a\nsettlement.\n    Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by\ninvading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the\noutbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style\ninfantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.\n    Each side has attacked the others' shipping.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
