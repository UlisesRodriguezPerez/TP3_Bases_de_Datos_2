        "BODY": "Gold is expected to continue its rise\nthis year due to renewed inflationary pressures, especially in\nthe U.S., Hamburg-based Vereins- und Westbank AG said.\n    It said in a statement the stabilisation of crude oil\nprices and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries'\nefforts to achieve further firming of the price has led to\ngrowing inflationary pressures in the U.S.\n    Money supplies in the U.S., Japan and West Germany exceed\ncentral bank limits and real growth of their gross national\nproducts, it added.\n    Use of physical gold should rise this year due to increased\nindustrial demand and higher expected coin production, the bank\nsaid.\n    Speculative demand, which influences the gold price on\nfutures markets, has also risen, the bank said.\n    These factors and South Africa's unstable political\nsituation, which may lead to a temporary reduction in gold\nsupplies from that country, underscore the firmer sentiment, it\nsaid.\n    However, Australia's output is estimated to rise to 90\ntonnes this year from 73.5 tonnes in 1986.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
