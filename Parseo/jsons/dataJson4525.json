        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 12 - ",
        "BODY": "House Speaker Jim Wright endorsed a\nproposal to require the president to take action to reduce oil\nimports if they threaten to top 50 pct of U.S. consumption.\n    Wright told reporters the plan by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, a\nfellow Texas Democrat, was positive and useful. Oil imports\npeaked in 1977 at 47 pct, were short of 36 pct last year and\nthis year are up over 40 pct, Bentsen said. \n    The Bentsen proposal, supported by 24 other Senators, would\nwould require the president to issue annual three-year oil\nimport forecasts. In any year they threatened to top 50 pct, he\nwould be ordered to propose quotas or other solution.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003"
