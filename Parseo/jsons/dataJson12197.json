        "BODY": "<Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>\nsaid it was lowering the interest rate on its Visa credit card\nto 15.9 pct from 18.6 pct, effective with the May billing\nstatement.\n    The bank said it was also halving its yearly Visa card user\nfee to six dlrs, but would retain its 15 ct fee for each\ntransaction.\n    A bank spokesman said the previously reported call by the\nCanadian Parliament's finance committee on March 20 for a\nsubstantial cut in credit card rates \"was a factor\" in the\nmove, but he would not elaborate.\n    Canada's minister of state for finance Thomas Hockin had\nthreatened legislation to reduce the rates, which apply to\nunpaid balances, if the financial institutions did not\nvoluntarily act.\n    The Canadian Imperial Bank spokesman said \"the bank card\nmarket is a very competitive one and we have to move to stay\ncompetitive.\"\n    Canadian Imperial's new rates match those of <Toronto\nDominion Bank>, which lowered its rates before the finance\ncommittee report.\n    Canadian Imperial Bank added that cardholders will be\nallowed to choose between the 15 ct transaction fee or the six\ndlr yearly card fee.\n    It will also eliminate the 50 ct minimum monthly\ntransaction fee, it said.\n    Minister of State for Finance, Tom Hockin, said in the\nHouse of Commons today he was \"delighted\" with the bank's cut\nin its credit card rate.\n    \"I would hope retail stores and other financial\ninstitutions will look to their rates as well,\" Hockin said\nduring the daily question period.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
