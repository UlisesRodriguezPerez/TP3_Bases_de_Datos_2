        "BODY": "The French primary bond market is showing\nsigns of renewed effervescence after several weeks of lethargy\nand the trend is expected to continue if hopes of imminent\ninterest rate cuts are fulfilled, market operators said.\n    The Bank of France is generally expected to give a signal\nto the market, possibly at the beginning of next week, by\nannouncing a quarter point cut in its intervention rate, which\nhas stood at eight pct since January 2, or in its seven-day\nrepurchase rate, set at 8-3/4 pct since January 5.\n    The central bank's averaged-out day to day call money rate,\nthe reference rate for interbank money market operators, which\nreached 8-3/4 pct on February 18 has fallen to 7-3/4 pct this\nweek, dealers noted.\n    The Bank of France's \"open market\" policy to regulate the\nmoney markets since December has been based on a floor and\nceiling of rates within the limits of its intervention and\nseven day repurchase rates.\n    For the moment the sentiment is of \"wait and see\" on rate\ncuts, but there are now more optimists than pessimists among\nmarket operators, a dealer for a major French bank said.\n    Dealers said there is abundant liquidity on the bond\nmarket, noting that this week's monthly Treasury tap issue of\n11.87 billion francs had a good reception and was fairly easily\nabsorbed.\n    The Treasury had set an upper limit on the issue of 12\nbillion francs and was likely to continue to try and sell as\nmuch paper as it could over coming months to meet its borrowing\nneeds for this year of around 150 billion, one banker said.\n    Dealers said there was no difficulty in placing liquidity\nin the primary market at the moment despite competition from\nthe surge in investments on the Paris stock exchange.\n    There has been a flood of large bond issues, but with\nformulas well adapted to market conditions and investor demand\n- with warrants or a mix of fixed and floating-rates - which\nhave been snapped up, and with generally broadly negative fees.\n    Dealers pointed to the recent Caisse d'Aide a l'Equipement\ndes Collectivites Locales (CAECL) 8.90 pct two billion franc\nbond with warrants exchangeable for floating-rate bonds issued\nover 13 years and 80 days at 97.04 pct with payment date March\n9, which was today quoted at -0.90 to -1.10 pct.\n    Even classic fixed-rate issues, after being neglected since\nthe end of last year, are finding buyers, one banker said.\n    Dealers said that now the question was to see how the terms\nof imminent operations would be set, with great market interest\nfocussed on the likely three next issues.\n    These will include an expected four to five billion franc\nissue for Electricite de France, to be followed by a bond of\naround one billion francs for Auxiliaire du Credit Foncier, a\nsubsidiary of the banking group Credit Foncier de France, and a\nnew issue by tender from the mortgage agency Caisse de\nRefinancement Hypothecaire.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
