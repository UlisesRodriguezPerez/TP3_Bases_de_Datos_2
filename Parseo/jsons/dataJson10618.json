        "BODY": "Lebanese central bank Vice Governor\nMeguerditch Bouldikian called for the establishment of an Arab\nfund to assist the Lebanese pound, which has lost more than 80\npct of its value against the dollar since January 1986.\n    Bouldikian told an Arab exchange dealers conference the\nbank would continue to take measures to defend the currency.\n    But he said Lebanon needed foreign support for its\nwar-battered economy now more than ever before. \"We expect a\ncommon effort between the central bank and Arab central banks\nand monetary authorities to create an Arab fund to support and\npreserve the value of the currency when needed,\" he said.\n    Twelve years of civil war have devastated productive\nsectors of the Lebanese economy and created gaping trade and\nbudget deficits.\n    Bouldikian said recent government measures had succeeded in\nreducing demand for imports and increasing exports. \"These are\nencouraging factors, but the war has not ended yet,\" he said.\n    \"We believe that with a just political solution acceptable\nto all sides, confidence will return and this will benefit the\nLebanese pound and Lebanon.\"\n    In the meantime, he said the central bank had four main\ngoals:\n    1) to use surplus liquidity to finance the budget deficit\n    2) to increase the role of commercial banks and non-bank\nfinancing institutions in financing the deficit\n    3) to limit the transfer of Lebanese pounds into foreign\ncurrency deposits\n    4) to protect the financial health of commercial banks.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
