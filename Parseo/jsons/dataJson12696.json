        "BODY": "There is little scope for a substantial\nincrease in U.S. interest rates during 1987, said Federal\nNational Mortgage Association chairman David Maxwell.\n    Speaking to the New York Financial Writers' Association,\nMaxwell said he viewed this week's rise in U.S. banks' prime \nrates to 7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 pct as a temporary phenomenon.\n    \"I don't see a substantial rise in rates this year. If\nanything, the Federal Reserve is more likely to ease than to\ntighten (monetary policy) because so many sectors of the\neconomy are showing weakness,\" Maxwell said. Fannie Mae buys\nmortgages from lenders and issues mortgage-backed securities.\n    Maxwell said restructuring of Fannie Mae over the last two\nyears had limited its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. A\none pct rise in rates in 1987 would cost shareholders about 18\ncts a share versus one dlr a share in 1981, he said.\n    Maxwell also questioned the view that housing crowds out\nother sectors of the economy from obtaining needed capital.\n    \"There's no evidence that housing is crowding firms out of\nthe long-term debt market,\" he said. Both home mortgage debt\nand long-term corporate debt grew at about equal annual rates\nof about 13 pct in 1986 -- a year when mortgage originations of\n442 billion dlrs needed record housing capital, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
