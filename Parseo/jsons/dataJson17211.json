        "DATELINE": "    OSAKA, April 27 - ",
        "BODY": "Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa\ntold a press conference the basic solution to currency\ninstability among major nations is economic policy\ncoordination.\n    He said that is a time-consuming process as coordination\ndoes not always proceed in a way policy makers envisage. \"That\nis democracy,\" he said. Upon that foundation, Miyazawa said,\nthere must be coordinated intervention. Major nations have\nsufficient funds to continue concerted intervention, he added.\n    \"Without doubt this set-up of coordinated intervention will\ncontinue to operate,\" Miyazawa said.\n    Miyazawa said Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and U.S.\nPresident Ronald Reagan are likely to reaffirm the Louvre and\nWashington Group of Seven (G-7) agreements on currency\nstability when they meet later this week.\n    Asked whether the dollar is declining against all major\ncurrencies, not only the yen, Miyazawa declined to make any\ncomments.\n    He reiterated that many major nations have undertaken\ncoordinated intervention in recent weeks to prop up the dollar,\nincluding countries who are not members of the G-7.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
