        "BODY": "The Philippines' Social Security System\n(SSS) is planning to buy eight mln shares in diversified brewer\n<San Miguel Corp> (SMC), SMC chief financial officer Ramon del\nRosario said.\n    He told reporters the government organisation had expressed\ninterest in one seat on SMC's 15-man board and was preparing to\ninvest 800 mln pesos, assuming a purchase price of 100 pesos a\nshare.\n    The shares involved in the proposal were part of the block\nof 38 mln shares owned by the United Coconut Planters Bank\n(UCPB) and sequestered by the government.\n    The block is split between class A and class B stock.\n    SMC also proposed to sell a further five mln shares to A.N.\nSoriano Corp, the family company of San Miguel president Andres\nSoriano, del Rosario said.\n    The shares are worth some 500 mln pesos at recent prices.\n    Del Rosario said the 14 mln B shares in the block which are\nopen to foreign ownership would probably be sold to\nunidentified foreign purchasers.\n    He said SMC and UCPB would meet later this week to try to\nresolve disputes over the pricing of the shares.\n    President Corazon Aquino earlier this month established an\narbitration panel to settle a row over the disposal of the\nshares.\n    Their initial sale to Soriano through SMC Hong Kong unit\nNeptunia Corp was blocked by the Presidential Commission on\nGood Government.\n    The commission sequestered the stock on suspicion that the\nreal owner of the block was Eduardo Cojuanco, the former\nchairman of San Miguel and the UCPB and a close associate of\ndeposed former president Ferdinand Marcos.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
