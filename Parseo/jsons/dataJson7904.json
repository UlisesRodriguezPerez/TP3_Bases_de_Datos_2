        "BODY": "<Hudson's Bay Co> said a writeoff of\n40.4 mln dlrs, or 1.39 dlrs per share, that it took in 1986 was\nmainly due to its investment in Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP>.\n     The company reported an operating profit of 33.0 mln dlrs,\nor 32 cts per share, for fiscal 1986, compared to an operating\nloss of 9,055,000 dlrs, or 1.23 dlrs per share, in the previous\nyear.\n     Hudson's Bay holds about four mln shares of Dome's 10 pct\nseries one cumulative subordinate convertible preferred shares.\n    Last March, Dome suspended payment of dividends on all\npreferred shares until June 1, 1987. The shares give the holder\nthe right to convert to Dome common shares at 3.33 dlrs per\nshare.\n    Dome has the right to force conversion if Dome common\nreaches 3.885 dlrs per share. Dome is trading at 1.12 dlrs per\nshare, down one ct, today on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n    Hudson's Bay also said it had an increase in 1986 in retail\noperating profit to 185.3 mln dlrs from 111.4 mln dlrs, but\nthat was partially offset by an increase of 14.9 mln dlrs in\ninterest costs and 25.3 mln dlrs in taxes.\n     Hudson's Bay also said its Markborough properties\nsubsidiary had an operating profit of 108.6 mln dlrs, up from\n98.8 mln dlrs the year before.\n    Profit from non-Markborough real estate was 23.5 mln dlrs\nin 1986, down from 27.6 mln dlrs a year ago.\n    Operating profit from natural resources was 4.2 mln dlrs,\nup 1.2 mln dlrs from the prior year. Pensions costs were\nreduced by 34.9 mln dlrs due to an accounting change. Total\ndebt declined during the year by 251 mln dlrs to 2.28 billion\ndlrs and debt to equity ratio improved to 1.8 to one from 2.1\nto one.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
