        "BODY": "The Pioneer Group Inc said its 70\npct-owned Teberebie Goldfields Ltd venture has been granted an\nadditional concession of land in Ghana to look for and mine\ngold.\n    The State Gold Mining Corp of Ghana granted the venture an\nadditional 14.5 square kilometers in Teberebie, Ghana,\ncontiguous to 11.5 square kilometers granted earlier, the\ncompany said.\n    The original concession appears to have a substantial\namount of gold bearing material containing about 2 grams, or\n6/100 ounces, of gold per metric ton.\n    But the venture has no firm estimates on the costs of\nextracting the gold and no assurances can be given that the\nreserves can be mined profitably, the company said.\n    It said Teberebie Goldfields has not conducted tests on the\nnewly granted land but added the land seems to be similar in\ngeological characteristics to the original land.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
