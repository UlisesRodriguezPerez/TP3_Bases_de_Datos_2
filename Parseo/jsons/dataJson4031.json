        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, March 11 - ",
        "BODY": "Britain today called on Japan to\nincrease foreign imports or risk the rise of protectionism and\nthe harm it would bring to it and other trading nations.\n    British Trade and Industry Secretary Paul Channon said\nJapan must heed a report issued by a Japanese government\nadvisory body in December calling for faster domestic demand to\nhelp cut its trade surplus and restructure its economy.\n    \"I recognise that the strong yen has brought problems to\nJapan's domestic economy,\" he told a group of Japanese\nbusinessmen in London.\n    \"But these short term difficulties should not be allowed to\ndeflect Japan from the fundamental reforms necessary,\" he said.\n    \"It is not just a domestic issue for Japan. If import\npropensity does not expand very soon there is a real risk from\nprotectionist lobbies, particularly in the U.S. With whom Japan\nhas so massive a surplus,\" he said.\n    \"They may well succeed in securing action by governments\nwhich would be highly injurious to trading nations like Japan\nand the U.K.\"\n    Channon said there had been substantial growth in the\nvolume of trade between Japan and Britain, amounting to 6.2\nbillion sterling (9.8 billion dlrs) last year.\n    But he added: \"Regrettably too much of it was in one\ndirection, with the Japanese selling us 3.7 billion sterling\n(5.8 billion dlrs) more than we sold them.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
