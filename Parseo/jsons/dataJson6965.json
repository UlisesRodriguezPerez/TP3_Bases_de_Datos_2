        "BODY": "Sweden's rate of inflation during\nJanuary has been revised downwards after a fault was made in\ncalculating the figures, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.\n    The January rise in consumer prices was 1.0 pct instead of\nthe previously announced 1.3 pct, the bureau said, without\nexplaining how the error arose.\n    Consumer prices in February rose 0.3 pct compared with 0.1\npct in February last year, the bureau said. The total inflation\nrate so far this year is therefore 1.3 pct, allowing for\nJanuary's revised figures, it added.\n    Year-on-year inflation rose to 3.4 pct in February, against\na revised 3.2 pct in January and a year-on-year rate of 5.3 pct\nin February 1986, the bureau said.\n    The slowdown in price rises was mainly due to a government\nimposed price freeze which came into force on February 4, the\nbureau added.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
