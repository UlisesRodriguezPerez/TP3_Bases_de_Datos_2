        "TITLE": "ANALYST SAYS USSR WINTER GRAINS HURT BY WEATHER",
        "DATELINE": "    MILWAUKEE, Wis., March 20 - ",
        "BODY": "The Soviet Union's winter grain\ncrop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting\nconditions last fall and severe cold this winter, an analyst of\nworld weather and crop conditions said.\n    Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell, author of the\nEF Hutton publication \"Global Crop News,\" said in her latest\nreport that the Soviets may import more grain, possibly wheat,\nfrom the U.S. due to potential crop damage.\n    \"Compared with last year, the outlook (for the Soviet\nwinter grain crop) is far more pessimistic,\" she said. \"But\nit's still too early to talk about disastrous losses. A lot\nwill depend on spring weather, not only for the outcome of the\ntroubled winter grain crop, but also for spring planting.\"\n    Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably\nprevented optimal seed germination for winter grains. Key wheat\ngrowing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasus\nreceived on 25-35 pct of autumn precipitation, she said.\n    The bitter winter cold temperatures -- which broke record\nlows that had stood for four decades -- also may have taken its\ntoll on Soviet winter crops, she said.\n    However, she noted that most of the southern grain belt had\nample snow cover, which should have well-insulated the majority\nof crop areas from severe frost damage.\n    The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains\nin the July 1986/June 1987 marketing year, primarily from\nCanada, the European Community, Argentina and Australia,\nMartell said.\n    She cited a number of reasons besides possible crop\nproblems that might point to additional Soviet import demand.\n    Last fall's dry weather may limit livestock grazing on\nmoisture-depleted pastures, while the cold winter weather\nnecessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy.\n    Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986\ngrain harvest of 210 mln tonnes, and said the Chernobyl\naccident may have contaminated more grain than originally\nthought and have to be made up with imports.\n    However, she said the U.S. remains a supplier of last\nresort for the Soviet Union, noting that the Soviets have only\njust recently begun their first U.S. grain purchases of the\n1986/87 season by buying 2.25 mln tonnes of corn.\n    Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980\ngrain embargo the U.S. is only a major supplier of grain to the\nUSSR during years of heavy Soviet demand.\n    In 1984/85, the U.S. supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grain\nimports of 55.5 mln tonnes. But in 1985/86, the Soviet Union\nbought 29.9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the U.S. for only\n24 pct of that total.\n    While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 1986/87\nwas 22 mln tonnes, many U.S. grain analysts have revised their\nestimates of Soviet imports up to 25-28 mln tonnes, she said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
