        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 19 - ",
        "BODY": "Energy Secretary John Herrington\nsaid he would rule out a tax on gasoline as one option to help\navert what his departmet has called the threat of increased\nreliance on foreign oil in the coming years.\n    He said at a news conference that any recommendation he\nwould make would have to increase domestic production, not\ncause widespread economic hardship and have a minimal cost to\nthe U.S. taxpayer.\n    On the grounds of increasing production, he said, \"I would\nrule out a gasoline tax.\"\n    Herrington also repeated he would rule out an oil import\nfee because of the widespread dislocation it would cause -- the\nloss of about 400,000 jobs nationwide due to higher oil prices\nand a drop in the gross national product by about 32 billion\ndlrs.\n    He said an increased depletion allowance, to 27.5 pct, on\nnew and enhanced production of oil and natural gas would be a\ncheap way to spur domestic production.\n    He estimated this cost at about 200 mln dlrs a year.\n    Herrington proposed the increased depletion allowance to\nthe White House Tuesday but the White House reaction was cool.\n    The White House said it would study the proposal, but was\ngenerally oppposed to altering the national tax code, just\npassed last year.\n    Herrington, asked his reaction to the White House reaction,\nsaid, \"If I were the White House, I would be cool, too.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
