        "BODY": "The Federal Reserve Board said it\napproved Citicorp's application to purchase through its\nsubsidiary, Citicorp Savings of Oakland, Calif., some assets\nand assume some liabilities of Sears Savings Bank of Glendale,\nCalif.\n    Citicorp Savings proposed to assume two billion dlrs in\ndeposits and other liabilities and to purchase 1.9 billion dlrs\nin assets of 50 branch offices of Sears Savings.\n    The proposal involved less than one third of the assets and\nliabilities of Sears Savings, owned by Sears, Roebuck and Co\n<S>.\n    The Fed said that it generally has determined there were\npotentially adverse effects of allowing affiliations of banks\nand savings and loan associations, although it has allowed bank\nholding companies to acquire some failing thrifts.\n    It said Citicorp's proposal \"properly may be viewed as the\npermissible acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of S\nand L branches rather than the acquisition of an S and L.\"\n    Citicorp Savings, the successor to the failed Fidelity\nSavings and Loan Association, has assets of 4.9 billion dlrs\nand operates 86 branches in California, mainly in the north.\n    Sears Savings has 6.6 billion in assets and 91 branches\npredominantly in southern California.\n    The application, which was approved unanimously, will not\neliminate Sears Savings as a competitor, the Fed said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
