        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, April 8 - ",
        "BODY": "Bankers Trust New York Corp said it has\nplaced its approximately 540 mln dlrs of medium- and long-term\nloans to Brazil on non-accrual status and that first-quarter\nnet income will be reduced by about seven mln dlrs as a result.\n    Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs\nof medium- and long-term debt on February 22.\n    U.S. banking regulations do not require banks to stop\naccruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue,\nbut Bankers Trust said it acted now because of \"the high\npotential of a continued suspension that would result in\nreaching the 90-day limit in the second quarter of 1987.\"\n    Assuming no cash payments at current interest rates are\nreceived for the rest of 1987, Bankers Trust estimated that\nfull-year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs.\n    Bankers Trust said it assumes that debt negotiations\nbetween Brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to the\nresumption of interest payments.\n    The negotiations resume in New York on Friday when central\nbank governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a\n90-day rollover of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that\nmatures on April 15.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
