        "BODY": "The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil\nshipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at\nleast four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.\n    The official said Ecuador could resume exports after\nrepairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links\njungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.\nIt would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,\nthe official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.\nEcuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35\ndays and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.\n    The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the\n12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the\npipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil\naccounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as\n60 pct of government revenues.\n    Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation\nof Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping\nabout 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd\nabove the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy\nMinistry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of\n173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.\n    However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline,\ncosting 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian\npipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take\nabout 60 days to build.\n    Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986,\nhad only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end\nof January, about equal to one month's imports.\n    It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion\ndlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's\ntotal foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in\nLatin America.\n    In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would\nloan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three\nmonths to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.\n    Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies\nand would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in\nrepayment in May, Lusinchi said.\n    A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister\nHector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior\nand defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de\nVenezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and\nco-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
