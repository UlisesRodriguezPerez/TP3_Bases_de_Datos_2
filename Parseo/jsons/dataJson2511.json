        "BODY": "The Reagan administration wants to\nencourage expanded trade with the Soviet Union but does not\nbelieve Moscow yet warrants most-favored-nation treatment,\nDeputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said.\n    \"It seems to me that more trade between us is better than\nless trade,\" he told a forum on U.S.-Soviet trade relations.\n    To that end, the administration in January allowed foreign\npolicy controls on the export of oil and gas equipment to the\nSoviet Union to lapse, he said.\n    Also, Washington and its allies are reviewing remaining\nexport controls in hopes of simplifying the list of prohibited\nitems and speeding up the licensing process, he said.\n    Whitehead said, however, the prefential treatment that\ncomes with most-favored-nation status is out for the moment.\n    U.S. law prohibits most-favored-nation status for countries\nthat restrict emigration and other rights.\n    \"What we have seen so far (in improved rights under Soviet\nLeader Mikhail Gorbachev) are promising trends,\" he said.\n    But, he added: \"We don't know if they will continue, we\ndon't know how significant they will be.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
