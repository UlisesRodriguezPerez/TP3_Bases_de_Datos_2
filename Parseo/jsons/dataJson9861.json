        "BODY": "<Carolian Systems International Inc>\nsaid it anticipates profit for fiscal 1987 ending June 30 will\nbe lower than fiscal 1986 earnings of 410,000 dlrs, despite an\nexpected revenue increase of 37 pct to more than 3.5 mln dlrs.\n    After an extraordinary expense associated with the\nDecember, 1986 withdrawal of a planned common share offering,\n\"we expect to be modestly profitable for the year, but below the\n410,000 dlrs earned in fiscal 1986,\" the company said.\n    Carolian previously reported fiscal six month profit of\n12,933 dlrs, excluding an extraordinary loss of 17,210 dlrs,\ncompared to earnings of 69,829 dlrs in the prior year.\n    The company said it anticipated fiscal 1987 earnings to be\nlower due to withdrawal of its share offering, computer\nequipment shipment delays and costs associated with sales staff\nexpansion.\n    A strengthening Canadian dollar against U.S. currency will\nalso adversely affect revenues and earnings, since 85 pct of\nrevenues are generated by sales outside Canada, said Carolian,\na leading supplier of utility software for Hewlett-Packard\ncomputer systems.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
