        "DATELINE": "    TOKYO, April 27 - ",
        "BODY": "<Quintette Coals Ltd> of Canada and\nJapanese steelmakers failed to agree on the Canadian coal base\nprice over four years from April 1, but agreed to have another\nround of talks in late May, officials involved said.\n    Japanese firms have asked for the base price to be set at\n44 U.S. Dlrs per tonne (FOB), sharply lower than the 75 to 76\ndlrs of the past four years, they told Reuters. The base price\nis reviewed every four years under the long-term accord.\n    The Canadian mine insisted on maintaining the present\nprice, they said.\n    Japanese firms bought 4.75 mln tonnes of Quintette coal in\n1986/87, and plan to buy the same volume in 1987/88 depending\non the result of the talks, the officials said. They added\nJapan has no plans to withdraw its price cutback request due to\nrecent falls in coking coal prices on the world market.\n    Meanwhile <Gregg River Co> of Canada has agreed on a\nJapanese proposal to set a temporary price of 75.80 Canadian\ndlrs on and after May shipment following the failure of the\n1987/88 price talks, they said. Japanese firms plan to buy\n150,000 tonnes of Gregg River coal for May shipment and hold\nanother round of talks with Gregg in late May, they added.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
