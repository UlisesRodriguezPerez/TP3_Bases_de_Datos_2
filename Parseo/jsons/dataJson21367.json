        "DATELINE": "    Chicago, Oct 19 - ",
        "BODY": "An Iowa State University study showed\npork contains considerably less fat than indicated by\nlong-established U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics, the\nNational Pork Producers Council (NPPC) said.\n    Six of the seven muscle cuts evaluated in the study\naveraged 4.3 pct fat or less, well below American Heart\nAssociation guidelines for recommended foods. Eighty pct of all\nthe raw boneless rib chops evaluated in the study contained\nless than six pct fat, the NPPC said.\n    Meanwhile, USDA Handbook 8-10 - long used as the\nestablished authority on nutrient composition, indicates a fat\ncontent for center loin pork of 7.3 pct, the NPPC said.\n    Robin Kline, a dietitian and Director of Consumer Affairs\nfor the NPPC said he was not surprised at the wide discrepancy\nbetween the study and the USDA handbook.\n    \"Handbook 8-10 is based to a certain extent on information\nthat has been accumulated over the past 30 years. The\nstatistics in it about pork do not reflect the hog of today\nwhich is about 50 pct leaner than it was 20 or 30 years ago,\nthanks to genetic improvements and better feeding practices,\"\nKline said.\n    The study, funded by NPPC with producer checkoff money,\nevaluated pork carcasses from 47 Iowa producers in categories\nfrom 0.7 to 1.3 inches of backfat. Researchers measured the fat\ncontent of the seven muscles before cooking, and the fat,\nmoisture and tenderness of cooked boneless rib chops.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
