        "BODY": "American Express Co's stock fell\nsharply, reflecting, in part, investors' disappointment that\nthe company did not make an announcement about its plans for\nbrokerage unit Shearson Lehman Brothers, traders said.\n    The company has said it is studying options for its\nShearson unit. Traders said many investors anticipated an\nannouncement this weekend that it would spin off Shearson\nLehman. Also, they said, a flurry of arbitrage related sell\nprograms that pounded the general market today accelerated the\nselloff of American Express, a component of the Dow Industrial\nAverage. American Express fell 3-1/8 to 77-3/8.\n    \"It was part programs and part that there was anticipation\nof an announcement of a spinoff or something with Shearson this\nweekend, and that announcement never happened,\" one trader\nsaid.\n    In the last few minutes of trading on Friday, another\ntrader said, the stock jumped to close up 3-3/8, largely on\nanticipation that the company would make a weekend\nannouncement.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
