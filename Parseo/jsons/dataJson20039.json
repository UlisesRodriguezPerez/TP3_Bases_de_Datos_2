        "BODY": "U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel\nLawson said the Government was going ahead with this month's\nflotation of British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L> shares despite the\ncollapse on international stock markets.\n    \"We are going ahead because the whole issue has been\nunderwritten - we had it underwritten because there is always a\nrisk of this sort of thing happening,\" Lawson said in a BBC\nradio interview.\n    Lawson's remarks came as renewed selling on the London\nstock market took BP shares down a further 33p to 283, well\nbelow the 330p price set for the around seven billion stg\nissue.\n    Lawson said the U.K. Economy is fundamentally sound and\nadded that stock markets had reflected that recently.\n    \"I profoundly believe in the market system as the best way\nfor securing economic prosperity (but) that does not mean to\nsay the markets are infallible.\"\n    \"My advice to small investors...Is to remain calm. There is\nabsolutely no reason not to do so,\" Lawson said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
