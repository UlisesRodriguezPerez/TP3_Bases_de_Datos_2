        "BODY": "CIP Inc, wholly-owned by Canadian\nPacific Ltd, is considering building a pulp mill in Texas which\nwould use kenaf fibre instead of wood, CIP president Cecil\nSlenniken said in an interview.\n     The kenaf plant is a member of the hibiscus family and was\nartificially developed several years ago. The plant, which has\nbeen grown in Southern Texas, reaches a height of 10 feet in\nthree months and is said to produce better quality newsprint\nthan wood pulp, a CIP official said.\n     Slenniken said the company has commissioned studies for a\n200,000 tonne capacity pulp mill which would use the fibre but\nwould need partners to begin the project.\n    \"We are not yet ready to commit the hundreds of millions of\ndollars it would take for such a project,\" Slenniken said.\n     He said CIP has been using the pulp on a trial basis to\nmake newsprint containing 90 pct kenaf fibre and 10 pct\nsoftwood fibre at its Trois-Rivieres, Quebec plant.\n    CIP, Canada's second largest newsprint producer, recently\nlaunched a 366 mln Canadian dlr newsprint mill at Gold River,\nBritish Columbia which is due begin producing 230,000 metric\ntonnes per year by fall of 1989.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
