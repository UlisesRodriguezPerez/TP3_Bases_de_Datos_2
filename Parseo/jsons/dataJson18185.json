        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, June 2 - ",
        "BODY": "Henry Kaufman, managing director of\nSalomon Brothers Inc, said the nomination of economist Alan\nGreenspan to replace Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul\nVolcker is bearish in the near term for the fixed income and\ncurrency markets.\n    \"The basic direction of interest rates is not changed. The\nfundamental direction of interest rates continues to be upward,\ninterrupted by intermittent rallies,\" Kaufman said in a\nstatement. He said the implication for equity markets in\nneutral to bullish.\n    Kaufman said, \"Unlike Paul Volcker, who entered the office\nof the Federal Reserve chairman with strong credibility both\ndomestically and internationally, Mr Greenspan will have to\ndemonstrate both his competence and policy independence before\nhe can gain full confidence of the financial markets.\"\n    Greenspan is most knowledgeable on the behavior of the U.S.\neconomy, while his professional skills in the international\narea are much more limited, Kaufman noted.\n    \"Consequently, although he is well known abroad, his views\non issues such as the Less Developed Country Debt may initially\ncarry less weight than have those of Mr Volcker.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
