        "BODY": "<AB Catena>, in which AB Volvo\n<VOLV.ST> has a 48 pct stake, said it was proposing a\ntwo-for-five stock issue that will raise the company's equity\ncapital to 420 mln crowns from 300 mln.\n    Catena reported profits after financial income and costs up\nto only 231 mln crowns from 207 mln in 1985, despite an\nincrease in sales to 8.54 billion crowns from 5.59 billion in\n1985.\n    The company said that its 1986 performance was best\nreflected by earnings after writeoffs, which rose to 310 mln\nfrom 221 mln in 1985.\n    Catena's increase in sales was mainly due to the takeover\nof Safveans AB in February 1986, which changed the business\nprofile of Catena. It had principally operated as a Volvo\ndealer. With the Safveans acquisition it is now mainly a\ntrading and industrial company.\n    In December 1986 Catena sold its share in the stockbroking\nfirm Jacobson och Ponsbach Fondkommission AB. This yielded a\nprofit of 386.7 mln crowns and was reflected in Catena's\npre-tax earnings which rose to 724 mln crowns from 204 mln in\n1985.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
