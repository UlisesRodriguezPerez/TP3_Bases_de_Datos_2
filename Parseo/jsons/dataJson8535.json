        "BODY": "U.S. Agriculture undersecretary Dan\nAmstutz indicated the United States is willing talk with the\nSoviet Union about the competitiveness of U.S. wheat prices but\nwould not discuss making U.S. wheat prices \"cheap.\"\n    \"There sometimes is a difference between being competitive\nand being cheap,\" Amstutz told a Senate Agriculture\nAppropriations hearing.\n    Amstutz said the difference of opinion between Moscow and\nWashington last summer on the level of the U.S. subsidy offered\non wheat to the Soviet Union, was over whether the U.S. wheat\nprice was competitive or cheap.\n    \"I think there is a (U.S.) willingness to explore this\nissue as it pertains to competitiveness,\" Amstutz said.\n    However, Amstutz added that the United States would not be\nwilling to discuss wheat prices with Moscow \"if the issue is\nbeing cheap.\"\n    Asked later by a reporter what he meant by the distinction\nbetween competitive and cheap, Amstutz would not elaborate.\n    Amstutz said it is the U.S. judgment that the long-term\ngrain agreement between the two countries calls for Moscow to\nbuy at least four mln tonnes each of wheat and corn annually at\n\"prices in effect in this country.\"\n    Amstutz made the comments in response to a question from\nSen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, about expanding the export\nenhancement program to include grain sales to the Soviet Union.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
