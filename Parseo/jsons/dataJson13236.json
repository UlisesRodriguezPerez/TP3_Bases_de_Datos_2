        "BODY": "Oil output in the United Arab Emirates\n(UAE) dropped ten pct in March from February to an average 1.05\nmln barrels per day (bpd), mainly because of customer\nresistance to fixed prices of Abu Dhabi oil, industry sources\nsaid.\n    The UAE quota assigned by the Organisation of Petroleum\nExporting Countries (OPEC) is 902,000 bpd. Traders could buy\nAbu Dhabi's Umm Shaif crude on the spot market for 17.50 dlrs a\nbarrel yesterday, against the official OPEC price of 17.72\ndlrs.\n    The sources said output by Abu Dhabi, the largest UAE\nproducer, fell to around 700,000 bpd from a range of\n800,000-820,000 bpd during the preceding four months.\n    Dubai production slipped to an average 350,000 bpd from\naround 370,000 in February after the emirate declared a\nmid-February output cut to help boost world oil prices, the\nsources added.\n    Most of the Abu Dhabi drop came from the offshore Umm Shaif\nand Upper and Lower Zakum fields as customers found fixed\nprices too high and cut liftings, the sources said.\n    The onshore Murban grade was less affected because Japanese\nterm buyers saw strategic benefit in maintaining liftings, they\nadded. The Japanese firms lift around 120,000 bpd, most of it\nMurban.\n    Abu Dhabi considers output from Upper Zakum, which came on\nstream in 1983, to be test production not included in\ncalculations for complying with the OPEC quota.\n    Without Upper Zakum, the UAE would be producing roughly its\nquota in March, the sources added.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
