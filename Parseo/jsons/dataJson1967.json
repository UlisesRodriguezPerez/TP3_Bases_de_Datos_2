        "DATELINE": "    PARIS, March 5 - ",
        "BODY": "The Bank of France is likely to cut its\nmoney market intervention rate by up to a quarter point at the\nstart of next week.  This follows a steady decline in the call\nmoney rate over the past 10 days and signals from the Finance\nMinistry that the time is ripe for a fall, dealers said.\n    The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of\nthe meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five\nindustrial countries and Canada on February 22, which restored\nconsiderable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks\nof turbulence.\n    The call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on February\n23, the day after the Paris accord, and then edged steadily\ndown to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3/4 pct on March 3,\nwhere it has now stabilised.\n    Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb\nliquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct.\n    While call money has dropped by well over a percentage\npoint, the Bank of France's money market intervention rate has\nremained unchanged since January 2, when it was raised to eight\npct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide.\n    The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at\n8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5.\n    The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchase\nrate to set an upper indicator for money market rates, while\nusing the intervention rate to set the floor.\n    Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said\nthat he would be happy to see an interest rate cut, and dealers\nsaid any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come\nwhen the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday,\nalthough an earlier cut could not be excluded.\n   A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early\nas tomorrow morning, banking sources said.\n    They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an\nacceleration in foreign funds returning to France, discouraging\nthe authorities from making a hasty rate cut. But they also\npointed out that money supply is broadly back on target, giving\nscope for a small fall in rates.\n    M-3 money supply, the government's key aggregate, finished\n1986 within the government's three to five pct growth target,\nrising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
