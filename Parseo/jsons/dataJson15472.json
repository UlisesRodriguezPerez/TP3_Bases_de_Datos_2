        "BODY": "The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation\n(FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely to\nfall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand.\n    FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world\ngrain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in\n1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the Soviet\nUnion, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.\n    World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to\nrise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening the\nimpact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenly\ndistributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S.\n    \"Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many\ndeveloping countries, particularly in Africa, depend crucially\non the outcome of this year's harvests,\" FAO said.\n    FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at\na record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than last\nseason and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986\nharvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.\n    FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised\nupwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of\nsubstantial buying by China and the Soviet Union.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
