        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 2 - ",
        "BODY": "The Canadian government is expected\nto announce later this week its final ruling whether U.S. corn\nexports to Canada have injured Ontario corn growers, U.S.\ngovernment and farm group representatives said.\n    The deadline for a final determination is March 7.\n    U.S. officials said they are encouraged by the outcome in a\nsimilar case covering European pasta imports. In that case,\nCanada decided pasta imports, which take about ten pct of the\nCanadian market, did not injure domestic producers. U.S. corn\nexports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market.\n    Canada slapped a 1.05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. corn\nimports in November 1986, but reduced the duty to 85 cts last\nmonth because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to \ncorn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
