        "BODY": "Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Hisham Nazer\nsaid Riyadh would not agree to a cut in oil prices and would\nnot accept a \"mad\" increase that would drive consumers away.\n    He told al-Riyadh newspaper, \"Saudi Arabia follows a\nbalanced petroleum policy. It does not approve of a decrease in\nprices from current levels and it also does not accept a mad\nincrease that would drive consumers away and make them try and\nfind alternative sources (for energy).\"\n    OPEC agreed last December to cut production after world\nprices hit new lows in 1986. They agreed on a pricing system\naimed to stabilise the market around 18 dlrs a barrel.\n    OPEC is scheduled to meet in Vienna on June 25, where it\nwill review its current oil price and production policy.\n    Saudi Arabia's King Fahd said last month that he wanted oil\nprices to remain stable for the next two years.\n    Saudi Arabia is the architect of the current pricing and\nproduction pact, which is backed by Kuwait and the UAE. The\ncurrent pact set a production ceiling for first half 1987 of\n15.8 mln bpd, and implemented fixed prices based on an 18 dlrs\na barrel average.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
