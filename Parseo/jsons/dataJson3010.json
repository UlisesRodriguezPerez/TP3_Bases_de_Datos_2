        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 9 - ",
        "BODY": "The Treasury Department said it would\ntemporarily permit imports of South African uranium ore and\noxide pending clarification of anti-apartheid sanctions laws\npassed by Congress last fall.\n    The decision was announced late Friday. It applies, until\nJuly 1, to uranium ore and oxide imported into the U.S. for\nprocessing and re-export to third countries.\n    The Treasury said it took the action because it felt that\nwhen Congress passed the comprehensive South African sanctions\nbill last fall over President Reagan's veto it had not intended\nto hurt U.S. industry.\n    In addition, the Treasury said it would permit U.S.-made\ngoods to be imported temporarily from South African\nstate-controlled organizations for repair or servicing.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003"
