        "BODY": "Australia's crude\noil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of a\ntargeted rather than broadly-based approach, Federal Resources\nand Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here.\n    He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association\n(APEA) annual conference there was a prospect of developing a\npackage that would recognise the government's economic\npriorities while also meeting some of the industry's concerns.\n    Evans was referring to a nearly completed government review\nof oil taxation.\n    Evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted\napproaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results\nin recent years.\n    These include the reduction in the top marginal crude\nexcise rate on 'old' Bass Strait oil found before September\n1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct, and the waiver of excise on onshore\noil announced last September, he said.\n    The industry, through the APEA, has been calling for the\nelimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost\nincentives for prospecting against a background of weak prices\nand Australia's relatively low exploration levels.\n    \"While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to\nan already complex taxation regime, I am inclined to favour\nthese kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes,\nwhich leave (government) revenue much reduced and may still\nleave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are\ngoing to do in major areas,\" Evans said.\n    He said the government did not intend to change its\nresource rent taxation (RRT) legislation, now before\nparliament, in response to industry calls to allow all\nexploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible.\n    As previously reported, RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited to\nhighly prospective offshore areas, based on profits after a\ncertain rate of return has been achieved for individual\nprojects.\n    APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax because\nexploration deductibility is limited to successful projects.\n    Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based more\nthan anything on the government's desire to ensure the\ncertainty and stability of the new regime, adding that major\ninvestments have already been planned on the existing ground\nrules.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
