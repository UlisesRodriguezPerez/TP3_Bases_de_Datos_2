        "BODY": "The West German intervention board said\nabout 100,000 tonnes of sugar have been offered into\nintervention so far.\n    A spokesman, speaking from Frankfurt, told Reuters offers\nhave increased recently but contracts have not yet been\nconcluded. A European Commission spokesman in Brussels earlier\nconfirmed that one mln tonnes of sugar had been offered to\nintervention boards in various member states. The intervention\nboard spokesman in Frankfurt said, \"One million tonnes is an\nawful lot and the Community's coffers are almost empty. This\ncould turn into a serious political problem.\"\n    West German trade sources said they believed the one mln\ntonne offer by the EC sugar industry into intervention would\nhave a neutral market impact overall.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
