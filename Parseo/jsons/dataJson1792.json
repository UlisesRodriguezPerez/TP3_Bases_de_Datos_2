        "BODY": "The directors of the American Farm\nBureau, the nation's largest farm organization, voted Tuesday\nto urge Congress to leave the 1985 farm bill in place without\nalterations.\n    \"We are solidly opposed to opening up the 1985 farm bill,\"\nsaid Dean Kleckner, president. \"The current farm bill has been\nin place for just a little over a year and in our judgment\nthere is more to be gained at the present time from maintaining\nthe legislation.\n    \"Several independent studies ... indicate the 1985 farm\nbill is better on balance than any of the alternatives being\nadvanced,\" Kleckner said.\n    The Farm Bureau also urged Agriculture Secretary Richard\nLyng to adjust the loan rate for 1987 crop soybeans as much as\nhe deems possible under the farm bill to keep soybeans\ncompetitive in the world market.\n    A Farm Bureau proposal suggests that producers should be\neligible for supplemental payments in the form of PIK\ncertificates for the difference between 5.02 dlrs a bushel and\nthe new loan rate.\n    The organization also urged Lyng to authorize deficiency\npayments to farmers who were unable to plant 1987 winter wheat\nbecause of adverse weather.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
