        "BODY": "Fifteen countries in Eastern and\nSouthern Africa have agreed to cut tariffs on regional trade by\n10 pct every two years up to 1996.\n    A statement by the Preferential Trade Area (PTA), which\nseeks to create a common market stretching from Ethiopia in the\nnorth to Lesotho in the south, said the governments would make\nthe first tariff cut next year.\n    In 1996 they would assess the impact of the tariff\nreductions and work out a new timetable for the complete\nelimination of all barriers to trade by the year 2000.\n    The PTA, set up in 1982, groups Burnudi, the Comoros,\nDjibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Rwanda,\nSomalia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\n    PTA sources said the agreement averted a split between\nmembers wanting more progress towards free trade and weaker\nstates concerned about the effects on customs revenue.\n    The reductions cover only a common list of 300 or so widely\ntraded commodities and goods but PTA sources said the\norganisation planned to expand the list to include 425 items.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
