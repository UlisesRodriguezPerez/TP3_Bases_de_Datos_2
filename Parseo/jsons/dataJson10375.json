        "TITLE": "INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP",
        "AUTHOR": "    By Ajoy Sen, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    NEW DELHI, March 27 - ",
        "BODY": "India is searching for non-communist\ncountertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and\nconserve foreign exchange.\n    Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and\nelectronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are\nall on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,\nchemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.\n    Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in\n1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading\nCorp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).\n    \"The two state trading corporations are free to use their\nbuying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian\nexports,\" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that\nprivate firms are excluded from countertrading.\n    One trade source said India has targetted countries that\ndepend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign\nimports.\n    However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part\nof India's total trading and are likely to account for less\nthan eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade\nduring the nine months ended December, the sources said.\n    Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65\nbillion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,\nagainst almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.\n    However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern\nBloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.\n    Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of\nagricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude\noil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,\nagainst three billion in 1985/86.\n    Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help\nnarrow the country's large trade deficit, is still\ninsignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,\nVenezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.\n    The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96\nbillion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion\nin the current fiscal year.\n    But the push to include non-communist countries in\ncountertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow\ngrowth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,\nshrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.\n    One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting\ncountertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made\ndiscreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot\nofficially support bartering.\n    The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore\nexports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.\n    \"MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that\npreference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind\nfor goods and services sold to India,\" a trade official said,\nadding that the policy remains flexible.\n    \"We also take into account other factors such as prices at\nwhich the goods and services are offered to India,\" the trade\nofficial said.\n    Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign\ncompanies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs\nand railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance\nif they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade\nsources said.\n    Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean\nfirm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln\ndlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
