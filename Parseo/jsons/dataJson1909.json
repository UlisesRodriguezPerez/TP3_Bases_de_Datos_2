        "BODY": "OPEC countries are all sticking firmly to\nofficial crude oil prices but the volatility of spot prices is\nlikely to continue into the third quarter, Indonesian Minister\nof Mines and Energy Subroto told Reuters.\n    Subroto, attending a Pacific Energy Cooperation conference,\nblamed recent rapid spot price changes on unbalanced supply and\ndemand. \"If we stick to the production limitation, the third\nquarter will be in better balance.\"\n    He said the market is in a period of transition while the\nimpact of OPEC's December agreement to cut output and fix\nprices at an average 18 dlrs a barrel is worked through.\n    Asked whether OPEC members of the Gulf Cooperation Council\n(GCC) had any concrete proposals to help Qatar sell its crude\noil in the face of strong resistance to its official prices,\nSubroto said: \"Apparently they have taken care of that.\"\n    \"They (the GCC) meet very often among themselves. I think\nthey'll help each other,\" he said.\n    Subroto said that as he was not a member of OPEC's Price\nDifferentials Committee he did not know why the meeting had\nbeen postponed from its scheduled April 2 date.\n    \"Maybe they find it is better not to have the meeting\nbecause ... Everyone is sticking to official prices,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
