He did\nnot say when this would be, but added the contracts would not\nbe bound by restrictions imposed during the second round.\n    China has signed 36 oil contracts and agreements with 37\ncompanies from 10 countries since 1979, when offshore\nexploration was open to foreigners. Eleven contracts were\nterminated after no oil was discovered.\n    Foreign firms have invested 2.1 billion dlrs on offshore\nChina since 1979.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
