        "TITLE": "LOWER MARK RATE SPECULATION NOT SHARED IN GERMANY",
        "AUTHOR": "    By Jonathan Lynn, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    FRANKFURT, April 29 - ",
        "BODY": "Speculation abroad that the\nBundesbank will steer money market rates lower, opening the\nfor interest rate cuts around Europe, is not shared by many\neconomists and money market dealers within Germany.\n    Speculation has developed that the Bundesbank would\nengineer lower rates to take pressure off the dollar/mark.\n    A strong rise in U.S. Market rates this month, prompting\nspeculation the Fed would raise its 5-1/2 pct discount rate,\nhas raised the question whether Germany and Japan would also\nbroaden interest rate differentials to support the dollar.\n    The U.S.-Japanese trade dispute is the key to the interest\nrate outlook, money market dealers in Paris said.\n    Talks this week between Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro\nNakasone and President Reagan, if successful, could take\npressure off the dollar, dealers and economists said.\n    Short term interest rates would be likely to ease if the\ntrade dispute is solved and the dollar steadies, they said.\n    But if no solution is found, the Paris dealers said, a\nrenewed dollar fall would put strains on the mark/French franc\nrate and force the Bank of France to raise short-term rates.\n    The three-month U.S. Treasury bill rate rose to six pct\nthis week from 5.6 pct at the start of April, and the yield on\nthe 30-year benchmark treasury bonds rose this week in Tokyo to\na 14-month high of 8.86 pct from 7.66 pct in late March.\n    The dollar stabilized today just below 1.80 marks and above\n140 yen, underpinned by higher U.S. Rates and the Fed discount\nrate speculation.\n    But most dealers expect it to weaken further, which would\nput pressure on the Bundesbank to ease interest rates.\n    Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said yesterday\nthe U.S. Had requested Japan to cut short-term interest rates.\n    The Bank of Japan was making efforts to do this, he said,\nadding the U.S. Had not asked for a cut in Japan's 2.5 pct\ndiscount rate, a move which Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi\nSumita said was not under consideration.\n    A call for a German move came yesterday from Dutch central\nbank president Wim Duisenberg, who said the Dutch central bank\nfavoured a cut in West German interest rates and would follow\nsuit if it happened.\n    Citibank AG said in its April report that another expected\nphase of dollar weakness would prompt the Bundesbank to cut key\nmoney market rates in the next three to six months.\n    The Bundesbank has set a fixed rate of 3.80 pct on\nrepurchase pacts since February, with call money trading around\n3.70 pct for much of April.\n    Phillips and Drew senior European economist Richard Reid\nsaid the Bundesbank would allow interest rates to ease further,\neither with a lower fixed rate tender, or a tender by interest\nrate, allowing the market to set the rate.\n    \"I'm fairly confident we'll see lower rates,\" he said.\n    Reid said taking 30 basis points off the repurchase rate\nwould have little impact on the German economy or fundamental\nexchange rates, but could change market currency perceptions.\n    \"A cut in German rates wouldn't be bad for the dollar, but I\nthink its effect would be limited in duration unless it was\naccompanied by other measures elsewhere,\" he said.\n    Money market dealers here noted the speculation abroad that\nthe Bundesbank would push down repurchase rates, but said the\nBundesbank had little reason to cut rates further at the\nmoment, despite the liquid market seen for most of this month.\n    The dealers said the Bundesbank was likely to move to an\ninterest rate tender for its repurchase pacts next month. That\nshould not be seen as a sign of easing monetary policy however,\nthey said.\n    The Bundesbank would merely be experimenting with interest\nrate tenders, following the introduction of a new system to\nspeed up the tender process at the start of April, they said.\n    Reinhard Pohl, head of the monetary policy section at the\nDIW economic research institute in West Berlin, said the\nBundesbank would probably not cut rates on repurchase pacts.\n    \"I don't think that if they cut the repurchase rate a little\nit would stop a wave of (currency) speculation,\" he said. But a\nsharp and sudden deterioration in the dollar could force the\nBundesbank to take some action, he said.\n    Pohl said the Bundesbank was concerned that a cut in\ninterest rates would accelerate excessive monetary growth.\n    Some Bundesbank officials have argued recently that the\nmonetary overshoot was due to strong currency inflows rather\nthan credit growth, and therefore a more appropriate response\nto excessive money supply growth would be to cut rates, to make\nthe mark and mark investments less attractive.\n    Pohl said the Bundesbank was hoping that domestic investors\nwould switch funds parked in liquid short-term accounts, which\nhave swollen central bank money stock, into securities, which\nwould take them out of the Bundesbank's key monetary measure.\n    A cut in interest rates at this stage however would lead\ninvestors to assume that rates had bottomed out and the next\nmove would be upwards. They would therefore hold off buying\nbonds, leaving central bank money stock swollen.\n    There are so far no signs that German investors are\nswitching funds into long term securities as the Bundesbank\nhopes they will, Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank\neconomist Hermann Remsperger said.\n    But Phillips and Drew's Reid said prospects of lower rates\nand a strong currency would attract foreign investors into\nGerman bonds, which would in turn attract domestic investors.\n    Werner Rein, chief economist at Union Bank of Switzerland\nin Zurich, said he thought it likely that interest rates would\ncontinue to drift lower in many European countries.\n    \"The scope for lower rates is probably greatest in Britain\nbut more limited in West Germany, where we could see some\nconsolidation,\" he said. Switzerland could be forced to match\nany cut in German rates to prevent the franc rising further\nagainst the mark, he said.\n    Currency dealers in London said another half-point cut in\nU.K. Bank base rates was likely in the next few weeks as the\npound had shrugged off yesterday's cuts and was still rising.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
