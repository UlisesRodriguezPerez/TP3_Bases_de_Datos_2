        "BODY": "The Emirates Industrial Bank has\npredicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states\nfollowing higher oil revenues.\n    A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, said\ntotal oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)\ncountries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from\n33.5 billion in 1986.\n    The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia\nand the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n    The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil\nprices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrain\noverall group production.\n    These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight\ndollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs.\n    \"All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in\nthe economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expected\ngrowth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,\"\nthe study said.\n    It added, however, that GCC states would experience higher\nbudget deficits this year because of needs arising from past\nrecession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts.\n    The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise\nto 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year.\n    It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states' combined\ntrade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in\n1985.\n    The UAE suffered a 19.5 pct drop in gross domestic product\nto 77.6 billion dirhams last year from 96.4 billion in 1985, it\nadded.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
