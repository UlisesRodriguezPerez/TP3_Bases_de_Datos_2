But some\nof these gains were offset by low levels of interest rates.\n    Provision for loan losses rose to 13.8 mln dlrs from 13.0\nmln a year earlier. At March 31, the allowance for loan losses\nwas 114.2 mln dlrs versus 94.8 mln at end of March 1986.\n    Non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at the\nend of the first quarter of 1986, largely because 119 mln dlrs\nof loans to Brazil were put on non-accrual status.\n    The bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual for\nthe remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reduced\nby about 4.9 mln dlrs.\n    National Westminster Bank USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary\nof National Westminster Bank PLC.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003"
