        "BODY": "Spain has revised some of its main\neconomic targets for 1987 after studying the performance of the\neconomy in the first quarter, the economy ministry said in its\nmonthly bulletin.\n    Internal demand is now forecast to rise four pct against a\nprevious target of 3.5 pct.\n    Mariano Rubio, governor of the Bank of Spain, the central\nbank, yesterday said internal demand was currently growing at\nan annual rate of six pct and it had to be brought down to four\npct if the government were to meet its five pct inflation\ntarget this year. Inflation was 8.3 pct in 1986.\n    The forecast for private consumption growth remains\nunchanged at three pct, although public consumption is revised\nupwards to 2.5 pct from 2.0 pct.\n    Growth in domestic demand will fuel imports, expected to\nincrease by 8.6 pct against an originally estimated 7.1 pct.\n    Export growth has been revised downwards to 3.7 pct from\n5.2 pct due to the peseta's continuing strength against the\ndollar and slack external demand.\n    Slow growth of exports and a tight rein on state spending\nhas lowered estimated GDP growth to three pct in 1987 from an\nearlier forecast 3.5 pct. GDP grew by three pct last year.\n    The economy ministry is holding its inflation forecast to\nfive pct, in spite of minister Carlos Solchaga's doubts last\nweek on whether this target could be maintained if wage\nsettlements continue to rise above the government's recommended\nfive pct ceiling.\n    Unions and employers dispute the average wage increases\nagreed so far this year. Trade unions calculate wage\nsettlements have produced average rises of 7.3 pct against 5.5\npct estimated by the employers' federation CEOE.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
