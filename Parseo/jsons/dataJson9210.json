        "BODY": "<Rainbow Corp Ltd> said it has\nlifted its stake in supermarket group <Progressive Enterprises\nLtd> to 52 pct from 44 pct.\n    It said in a statement it has bought an extra 9.4 mln\nshares at prices ranging from 3.80 N.Z. Dlrs to 4.80.\n    Progressive is currently the subject of both a proposed\nmerger with Rainbow and a full takeover bid from <Brierley\nInvestments Ltd> (BIL). The BIL bid, launched on Monday, is at\n4.20 dlrs a share. The Rainbow merger involves shareholders in\nboth Rainbow and Progressive being issued shares in a new\ncompany, <Astral Pacific Corp Ltd>, on a one-for-one basis.\n    Rainbow chief executive Craig Heatley said, \"In our opinion\nBIL's actions over the last few days have been undertaken for\ntheir own strategic purposes which conflict with the desire of\nboth companies to merge their interests.\"\n    BIL has said it is against the merger because it sees\nProgressive shares as being worth twice as as much as\nRainbow's.\n    Progressive traded today at 4.42, Rainbow at 3.66 and BIL\nat 4.30 at the end of morning trading on the New Zealand Stock\nExchange.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
