        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, June 15 - ",
        "BODY": "The proposed European Community (EC) levy\non oils and fats has been criticised by CAOBISCO, the\nassociation of EC biscuit, chocolate and confectionery\nmanufacturers.\n    In a letter to the President of the Council of Ministers,\nM. Eyskens, the association said the tax would cost the EC\nbiscuit, cake, chocolate and confectionery industries almost\n200 mln European currency units per year.\n    The tax also was contrary to the spirit of the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and could prompt U.S.\nRetaliatory measures on EC exports, CAOBISCO said.\n    In a parallel move the British Biscuit, Cake, Chocolate and\nConfectionery Alliance has written to U.K. Chancellor of the\nExchequer Nigel Lawson urging him to oppose the levy.\n    President Charles Gillett said the tax was extending the\nCommission's powers by allowing it to set levels of consumer\ntaxation, an area previously reserved for national treasuries.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
