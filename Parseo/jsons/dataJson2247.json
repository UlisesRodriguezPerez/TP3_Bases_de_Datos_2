        "BODY": "Securities and Exchange Commission\nChairman John Shad said the SEC favors shortening the current\n10-day period for disclosing takeover attempts but opposes\nputting restrictions on the use of so-called junk bonds.\n    \"We favor shortening the disclosure period to two days,\"\nShad told members of the House Telecommunications and Finance\nsubcommittee when asked for his recommendation.\n    He said the SEC's responsibility was to provide full\ndisclosure for securities, including junk bonds, and not to\nmake decisions based on merit. He said junk bonds had some\nvalue because of their liquidity.\n    Shad said he opposes proposals to require those attempting\ntakeovers to file a statement on the impact the takeover would\nhave on the communities involved.\n    \"We've opposed it in the past. It goes far beyond investor\nprotection,\" Shad said.\n    He said he had no comment on a proposal by House Speaker\nJim Wright, D- Texas, to tax securities transactions.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
