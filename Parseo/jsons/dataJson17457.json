        "BODY": "Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd\n<RGFJ.S> (RGC) and explorer <City Resources Ltd> have agreed in\nprinciple on a joint venture to re-examine the Bulolo alluvial\ngold field in Papua New Guinea, City Resources said.\n    City Resources would progressively earn up to 66.66 pct of\nRGC's Prospecting Authority 585, which covers all the field, by\nspending a total of 6.5 mln kina, it said in a statement.\n    It said it believed Bulolo was not fully exploited in the\npast, noting the literature refers to heavy gold losses in\ntailings during dredging from 1931 to 1967 which produced a\ntotal of 2.1 mln ounces.\n    City Resources also said previous dredging was only carried\nout to a depth of 36 metres and high grade gold values are\nreported to at least 60 metres in the central part of the\nBulolo Valley and possibly as deep as 90 metres.\n    In its productive life, recovered average grade at Bulolo\nwas 0.3 rpt 0.3 grams a tonne from some 207 mln cubic metres of\ngravel, it said. City Resources will act as operator.\n    The Bulolo field, in Morobe Province, was the first\nsuccessful gold mining operation of <Placer Development Ltd>\nafter it was floated in Canada in 1926. It operated the field\nuntil dredging ceased in 1967.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
