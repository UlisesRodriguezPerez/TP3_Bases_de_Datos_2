        "BODY": "Engineering group Linde\nAG's <LING.F> world group turnover rose to 518.6 mln marks in\nthe first two months of 1987, 5.2 pct more than in the same\n1986 period, management board chairman Hans Meinhardt said.\n    But world group incoming orders fell 2.2 pct to 587.3 mln\nmarks, Meinhardt told the annual news conference. Excluding\nexchange rate movements, world group turnover rose 8.9 pct and\nincoming orders increased 1.0 pct.\n    Linde expects satisfactory results and increased sales this\nyear but Meinhardt gave no detailed forecast. Domestic group\n1986 net profit rose to 105.79 mln marks from 80.71 mln.\n    Meinhardt said domestic group turnover rose 6.7 pct to\n394.1 mln marks in the first two 1987 months against the same\nperiod last year but incoming orders fell 5.2 pct to 456.6 mln.\n    Linde will ask shareholders at the annual meeting on May 13\nto raise authorised share capital by a maximum 30 mln marks\nnominal for the issue of share warrant bonds with a maximum\nissue volume of 200 mln marks. Linde's authorised share capital\ncurrently stands at a nominal 49.6 mln marks.\n    Meinhardt said the authorisation would give the company the\nnecessary flexibility in case Linde needed additional funds for\nacquisitions. He declined to give further details.\n    While world group turnover rose 7.2 pct to 3.88 billion\nmarks in 1986, incoming orders were barely changed at 3.91\nbillion marks. Meinhardt said without the sharp appreciation of\nthe mark against major trading partner currencies, incoming\norders would have been four pct above the prior year's level.\n    World group turnover in heavy plant construction rose 7.4\npct to 777 mln marks, but incoming orders dropped 5.7 pct to\n739 mln marks in the wake of the dollar and oil price plunge.\n    World sales for technical gases rose 5.1 pct to 1.05\nbillion marks and incoming orders gained 5.2 pct to 1.05\nbillion marks.\n    Meinhardt said Linde strengthened its market position in\nthe refrigeration sector, with particularly strong turnover and\norder gains in Austria, Italy and Norway. World group sales in\nthe sector fell 2.5 pct to 493 mln marks, but incoming orders\nrose 2.5 pct to 513 mln marks.\n    The fork lift truck and hydraulic sector saw world group\nsales rising 12.4 pct to 1.52 billion marks and incoming orders\ngaining 8.0 pct to 1.57 billion marks.\n    Domestic group turnover rose 8.2 pct to 2.93 billion marks\nand incoming orders increased 1.9 pct to 2.92 billion marks.\nThe company was producing at full capacity in 1986.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
