        "BODY": "The price of gold bullion is likely\nto rise in the second half of the year on increased private\ninvestor demand, West German analysts said.\n    Gold could rise as high as 500 dlrs per ounce later this\nyear, said Peter Witte, director of Westdeutsche Landesbank\nGirozentrale's trading division, after a presentation by the\nU.S. Mint to promote its gold and silver Eagle series coins.\n    \"A lot will depend on oil prices and developments on stock\nexchanges,\" Witte said, adding he saw gold positioned for\nfurther rises once it breaks out above 450 dlrs.\n    Gold was fixed this morning in London at 411.30 dlrs.\n    Despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks, many\ninvestors still want to buy physical gold, Witte said.\n    Interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stock\nexchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver.\n    Hermann Strohmeyer, vice president of Commerzbank AG's\nforeign exchange trading and treasury department, said gold is\npoised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second half\nof this year.\n    The price is unlikely to fall much below 380 or 390 dlrs an\nounce, and probably will continue in a range between 380 and\n430 dlrs in the first half of this year, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
