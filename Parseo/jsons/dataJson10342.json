        "BODY": "Thyssen AG <THYH.F> said\nit expects to post a good profit in 1987 despite anticipated\nlosses in its mass steel-making operations this year.\n    Managing board chairman Dieter Spethmann told the annual\nmeeting the group was satisfied with profit developments in the\nfirst half of the 1986/87 financial year to September 30.\n    The group's other three divisions -- specialty steel,\ncapital goods and trading -- had made a profit so far in\n1986/87, he added.\n    Spethmann said income from associate companies had also\nbeen good in early 1986/87.\n    In 1985/86 Thyssen's world group profit fell to 370.1 mln\nmarks from 472.4 mln in 1984/85, reflecting costs linked to its\nsteel operations. The company's dividend was an unchanged five\nmarks.\n    A Thyssen spokesman told Reuters that planned job cuts at\nsubsidiary Thyssen Stahl AG would be higher than announced\nearlier. Total job losses by 1989 were now expected to total up\nto 7,800 against original projections of 5,900. Thyssen Stahl\nemploys some 40,000 people.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
