        "BODY": "Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., said\nhe was considering amending the Senate Finance Committee's\ntrade bill with a provision to require a marketing loan for\nsoybeans, corn and wheat.\n    Pryor told the Futures Industry Association that there was\ngreat reluctance among members of the Senate Agriculture\nCommittee to reopen the 1985 farm bill, and that a marketing\nloan might have a better chance in the Finance panel.\n    The Arkansas senator said the marketing loan -- which in\neffect allows producers to pay back their crop loans at the\nworld price -- had led to a 300 pct increase in U.S. cotton\nexports in 14 months and a 72 pct increase in rice exports.\n    Pryor serves on both the Senate Finance and Agriculture\nCommittees.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
