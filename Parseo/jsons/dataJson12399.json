        "BODY": "Thai coffee exporters said they hoped\nthe International Coffee Organisation (ICO) would not reimpose\nexport quotas even though this may lead to a further slump in\nworld prices.\n    Susin Suratanakaweekul, president of the Thai Coffee\nExporters Association, told Reuters that Thailand obtained\nlittle benefit from previous ICO quotas which represented only\nabout 30 pct of its total annual exports.\n    Thailand expects increased overall coffee export revenue if\nthere are no restrictions on sales to current ICO members who\noffer higher prices than non-members, he said.\n    The Customs Department said Thailand exported 21,404 tonnes\nof coffee last year, up from 20,602 in 1985.\n    Thai coffee production is projected to fall to about 25,000\ntonnes in the 1986/87 (Oct/Sept) season from 28,000 the\nprevious year.\n    However, a senior Commerce Ministry official said the Thai\ngovernment supports coffee producers' lobbying for reimposed\nICO quotas which, he said, would help lift world prices.\n    Somphol Kiatpaiboon, director general of the Commercial\nEconomics Department, said an absence of ICO quotas would\nencourage producers to rapidly release coffee on to the market,\nfurther depressing prices.\n    He said Indonesia is expected to export a substantial\namount of coffee this month without such restrictions.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
