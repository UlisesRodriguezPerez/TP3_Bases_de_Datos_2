        "BODY": "The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co\n<PLDT.MN> is planning a two-for-one stock split and a 20 pct\nstock dividend later this year to reduce excess market\nbuoyancy, Vice-President Sennen Lazo told Reuters.\n    Lazo said the stock split would reduce the par value of the\ncompany's common stock from 10 to five pesos.\n    He said the stock split would apply to holders of about 18\nmln common shares of stock on the record date of September 15\n1987. \"The exercise should make our stock more marketable,\" Lazo\nsaid. \"Now it is beyond the reach of many small investors.\"\n    PLDT common stock surged from a low of 37 pesos in February\n1986 to 367.50 at close of trading yesterday on the Manila\nStock Exchange.\n    Lazo said the 20 pct stock dividend, payable on October 15,\nwould also apply to stockholders on record as of September 15.\n    PLDT reported 1986 net income of 1.89 billion pesos, up 68\npct from 778.9 mln pesos in 1985, on operating revenues of six\nbillion pesos, up from 4.7 billion pesos in 1985.\n    At end December 1986 the company had 417,100 stockholders.\n    A PLDT spokesman said the company's profits are likely to\nbe substantial since the government raised its franchise tax to\nthree pct from two and to impose a 35 pct corporate income tax\nfrom which it was previously exempt.\n    The government has not so far ordered the implementation of\nthe tax decision.\n    PLDT is the largest of 58 telephone companies in the\nPhilippines. On December 31 1986 the company had 856,014\ntelephones in operation, representing 94 pct of all instruments\nin the country.\n    In Manila item \"Philippine Telephone firm plans stock split\"\nplease read in page 3, first para, \"the company's profits are\nlikely to be substantially cut\" (inserting dropped word). This\nreplaces  \"the company's profits are likely to be substantial\"\n\u0003"
