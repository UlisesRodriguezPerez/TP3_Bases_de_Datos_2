        "BODY": "Amoco Corp's wholly owned Amoco\nCanada Petroleum Co Ltd said its proposed 5.22-billion-\nCanadian-dlr acquisition of Dome Petroleum Ltd will benefit\nCanada just like the foreign investment that made possible\ncommercial development of Alberta's oilsands.\n    Amoco Canada president T. Don Stacy told an oilsands\nconference that \"Amoco Canada has presented the solution to the\nDome problem, and we're investing our confidence, dollars and\ndetermination to make that solution work.\"\n    The Amoco buyout of debt-burdened Dome has angered Canadian\nnationalists, who want a Canadian buyer for Dome.\n    Stacy described Amoco Canada's previously reported share\noffer proposal as a chance to increase Canadian ownership of\nthe country's oil and gas industry, now at about 50 pct.\n    He reiterated that Amoco planned virtually no layoffs of\nDome employees. He also reaffirmed that Amoco would reinvest in\nAmoco Canada-Dome properties all available cash flow for five\nyears after the acquisition.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
