        "TITLE": "FINAL 50/50 CORN CERTS SEEN AT 1.6 BILLION DLRS",
        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 9 - ",
        "BODY": "The Agriculture Department will have\nto release an estimated 1.6 billion dlrs worth of in-kind\ncertificates, or certs, to corn farmers this fall if USDA\ndecides to maintain an equal split of total 1986 feedgrain\ndeficiency payments in cash and certs, USDA officials said.\n    Final 1986 crop deficiency payments will be available to\nfeed grain producers in October. Wheat deficiency payments for\nthe 1986 crop, now complete, were made in a 50/50\ncash-certificate split, and USDA officials have indicated they\nwant to do the same for feedgrains.\n    Over 3.2 billion dlrs of an estimated 6.0 billion in corn\ndeficiency payments have already been announced, with 1.42\nbillion dlrs (43 pct) set in certificates. The final payment\nmust be 1.6 billion dlrs in certs (57 pct) for a 50/50 split.\n    However, the release this month of almost 600 mln dlrs of\ndeficiency payments was equally divided in cash and certs,\ndoing nothing to bring up the percentage of certs.\n    Some USDA analysts said the payments reflected hesitation\nfrom the Office of Managament and Budget to allow another huge\nrelease of certs onto the market.\n    Bills are pending in Congress to move up the final\nfeedgrain deficiency payment to \"as soon as five months after\nharvest as possible,\" rather than the current year lag time.\n    Neither Rep. Edward Madigan (R-Ill.) nor Sen. Bob Dole\n(R-Kans.), sponsors of the bills, have brought the legislation\nforward. Aides said timing will depend on budget discussions.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
