        "BODY": "Monetary and credit growth rates in\nNew Zealand are not expected to continue at current levels\nfollowing the Reserve Bank's move to tighten liquidity late\nlast year, Reserve Bank Governor Spencer Russell said.\n    The monetary and credit growth figures for the December\nquarter were probably artifically inflated by unusually high\ngrowth in inter-institutional lending activity on the short\nterm money market, Russell said in a statement.\n    The bank moved to tighten liquidity when the initial signs\nof the recent expansion became apparent in September and\nOctober last year, Russell said.\n    Broadly defined M-3 figures released today showed growth of\n17.8 pct in the year ended December compared with 13.1 pct in\nthe year ended September.\n    Annual growth of private sector credit in calendar 1986 was\n30.7 pct compared with 16.5 pct in the September year.\n    \"Available evidence suggests that corporate customers,\nincluding non-bank financial institutions, have been exploiting\ndifferences between interest rates on overdrafts with trading\nbanks and rates in the call market,\" Russell said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
