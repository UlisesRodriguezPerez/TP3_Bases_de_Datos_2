        "BODY": "Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves,\nswollen by strong trade surpluses to a record 53 billion U.S.\nDlrs, are becoming a problem, government officials said.\n    Official figures show the latest level compares with the\nprevious record of 51 billion dlrs on March 4 and about 26\nbillion in late March 1986.\n    Central bank Governor Chang Chi-cheng told reporters the\nincrease in reserves was the result of heavy intervention by\nthe bank on the local interbank market. It bought nearly two\nbillion U.S. Dlrs between March 5 and 23, he said.\n    Wang Chao-ming, vice chairman of the government's Council\nfor Economic Planning and Development, told Reuters the rising\nreserves were \"a big headache for Taiwan.\"\n    He said the government expects heavier pressure from the\nU.S., Where protectionist bills are being proposed against\nnations such as Taiwan and Japan with large trade surpluses\nwith the U.S.\n    Wang said the government would launch new measures within\nthe next two months to further reduce import tariffs and open\nthe market wider to foreign products, especially those from the\nU.S.\n    Wang said the measures aim at helping reduce Taiwan's trade\nsurplus, which rose to 2.73 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first two\nmonths of 1987 from 2.02 billion a year earlier. Nearly 90 pct\nof the surplus was with the U.S.\n    Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-shien agreed with Wang's\nremarks and said efforts to avert U.S. Protectionism were\nrunning out of time. \"We must do it quickly or face retaliation\nfrom Washington,\" he said.\n    He said the measures would include removal of trade\nbarriers on insurance and inland services for U.S. Companies.\n    Chang Chi-cheng said the central bank could not stop buying\nU.S. Dollars because of heavy sales by local exporters who fear\nthe strong local dollar will cause them exchange losses.\n    He said the bank is studying revision of the foreign\nexchange rules in hope of further reducing currency controls,\nbut declined to give details.\n    The Taiwan dollar has risen about 15 pct against the U.S.\nDollar since September 1985. It opened at 34.38 to the U.S.\nDollar today and is expected to rise further to 33 in June and\nto 32 by end-year, some foreign bankers said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
