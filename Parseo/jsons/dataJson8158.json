        "BODY": "Burma's debt service ratio will have\nfallen to 48.8 pct in the fiscal year to end-March 1987 from 50\npct in 1985-1986, the official Council of People's Inspectors\n(CPI) reported.\n    Western diplomats in Rangoon estimate the figure at above\n70 pct and say the country can no longer depend on foreign\nexchange reserves to cover more than a few weeks' imports.\n    The CPI, which oversees government spending, said in its\nlatest report to parliament that foreign currency reserves fell\nto a record low of 407.9 mln kyats in September 1986 from 430.3\nmln in March 1986. Earlier figures were not available.\n    Debt servicing cost Burma 1.62 billion kyats in 1985-1986\nwhile foreign exchange earnings -- export revenues plus loans\nand aid -- totalled 3.23 billion kyats in the same period, the\ncouncil said.\n    Later figures were not available.\n    Burma, which diplomats here say now has foreign debts of up\nto 3.4 billion dlrs, has applied to the United Nations to be\nreclassified as one of the world's least developed countries in\norder to qualify for softer loan and grant aid.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
