        "BODY": "China should tighten imports of ordinary\ngoods and restrict or even forbid import of goods which can be\nmade domestically, Premier Zhao Ziyang said.\n    He told the National People's Congress, China's parliament,\nthat the country's foreign exchange is limited and must be used\nwhere it is most needed.\n    \"We should expand production of import substitutes and\nincrease their proportion,\" he said.\n    On exports, China should increase its proportion of\nmanufactured goods, especially textiles, light industrial\ngoods, electronics and machinery, he said.\n    Zhao said China should lower the cost of exports and\ncontrol the export of goods that incur too much loss. In 1986\nChina had a trade deficit of 11.9 billion dlrs, down from a\nrecord 14 billion in 1985.\n    Zhao said China should work to provide a more favourable\ninvestment environment for foreign businessmen. It should use\nforeign funds for production and construction, with stress on\nfirms making goods for export or import substitutes.\n    China should also earn more foreign exchange from tourists\nand contracted labour abroad, he added.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
