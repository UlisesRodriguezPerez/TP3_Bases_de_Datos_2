        "BODY": "Economic growth will remain sluggish in\nthe Netherlands and Belgium next year and unemployment may\nrise, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\nforecast.\n    Belgium's GDP growth may slow down to 1.5 pct this year and\nnext year, bringing a rise in the number of jobless, the OECD\nsaid in its semi-annual survey. Belgian inflation could\nstabilise at 1.5 to 2.0 pct, while the current account surplus\nwill probably remain large at about three pct of GDP.\n    While the Belgian government has made progress in trimming\nits borrowing requirement, \"it will probably be insufficient to\ncheck the self-sustaining nature of the deficit,\" the OECD said.\n    In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 1.5\npct this year and one pct in 1988, with Dutch exports becoming\nless competitive and imports rising. \"Employment is forecast to\ndecelerate as well, reflecting more sluggish growth in the\nprivate sector and budgetary cuts,\" the report said.\n    Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 0.5 pct in 1987\nand stay stable in 1988, partly as a result of declining\ndomestic gas prices.\n    Luxembourg's economy, by contrast, will see slightly faster\ngrowth in GDP this year as a result of an upward movement in\nwages. But real growth in consumption will ease next year.\nREUTER\n\u0003"
