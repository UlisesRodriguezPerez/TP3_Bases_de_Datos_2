        "BODY": "Cuban sugar output this season (1986/87)\nis put at around 7.5 mln tonnes raw value by broker C.Czarnikow\nin its monthly sugar market review.\n    Allowing for around 700,000 tonnes for the current year's\ndomestic usage it would leave around 6.8 mln tonnes for export\nof which, Czarnikow estimates, about 3.7 mln tonnes will be\ntaken by the USSR, 1.530 mln by other socialist countries and\nthe remainder for delivery to non-socialist bloc destinations.\n    Czarnikow also estimated USSR 1986/87 production at 8.75\nmln tonnes raw value which when added to the 3.7 mln imports\nfrom Cuba and set against its estimated domestic and export\nneeds of 14.2 mln tonnes will leave a gap of 1.75 mln tonnes to\nbe acquired from the world market. Soviet purchases to date may\nnot be far short of that quantity, Czarnikow said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
