        "BODY": "GAF Corp said the management group\nled by chairman Samuel J. Heyman intends to reconsider its\nproposal to acquire GAF.\n    On September 8, the group offered 64.00 dlrs in cash and\n2.50 dlrs principal amount of 15 pct junior subordinated\ndebentures due 2007 for each GAF share.  Heyman owns about\n2,700,000 of GAF's 33.5 mln shares outstanding.\n    In a letter to the committee of independent directors\nformed to consider the offer, Heyman said it will have to\nmodify the terms of the offer if it is to continue the bid, due\nto rising interest rates and financial market conditions.\n    Heyman said \"In the considerable time that has elapsed\nsince our original proposal was submitted, the credit and\nfinancial markets have experienced extraordinary and almost\nunprecedented deterioration.  As of the present time, the\naverage interest rate on the financing which we proposed to\nraise in connection with the acquisition has increased, since\nthe original proposal, by approximately 150 basis points.\"\n    He said the group intends to promptly review all available\noptions, including the revision of its offer to reflect current\nmarket conditions.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
