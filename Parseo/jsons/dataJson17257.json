        "BODY": "Insects are threatening to destroy\n367,000 hectares or about one-third of the spring rice crop in\nnorthern Vietnam, Hanoi radio reported.\n    Drought has hit another 189,000 hectares, with 40,000\nhectares very badly affected, it said.\n    Insecticides are in short supply so only the most\nendangered rice fields should be sprayed, the radio added.\n    The affected areas -- the Red River delta and other coastal\nareas in northern Vietnam -- produce between 30 to 40 per cent\nof the country's rice.\n    The radio report, monitored in Bangkok on April 20 but only\ntranslated here over the weekend, said the threatened damage\nwas spread over twice as large an area as last year.\n    Vietnam has not been able to grow enough food for its\nexpanding population, with the Soviet Union buying rice in\nThailand and Burma in recent years for supply to Vietnam.\n    Vietnam produced 18.2 million tonnes of food, most of it\nrice, last year and hopes to boost that to 23-24 million tonnes\nby 1990.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
