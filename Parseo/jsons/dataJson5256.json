        "BODY": "The volume of U.K. Retail sales rose a\nprovisional, seasonally adjusted 2.2 pct in February after\nfalling a final 2.2 pct in January, figures released by the\nDepartment of Trade and Industry show.\n    The February sales index, base 1980, was put at a\npreliminary 125.0 after a final 122.3 in January.\n    In the three months from December to February, the level of\nsales was little changed over the previous three months but was\nnearly six pct higher than the same year ago period.\n    On a non-seasonally adjusted value basis, retail sales in\nFebruary were a provisional 9.0 pct higher than a year earlier.\n    The Department noted the latest figures were similar to the\naverage in the fourth quarter last year but well above the\nJanuary index, which was depressed by the effects of severe\nweather.\n    The February trading period comprised the four weeks\nFebruary 1 to 28. Final February retail sales figures will be\npublished on April 6.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
