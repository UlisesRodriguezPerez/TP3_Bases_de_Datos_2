        "DATELINE": "    FRANKFURT, April 2 - ",
        "BODY": "A world recession is unlikely this\nyear as fiscal and monetary policy in most industrialized\ncountries is supporting the economy, Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F>\nmanagement board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said.\n    But growth rates will be smaller than last year, with 1.5\nto 2.5 pct likely in most industrialized countries, he told a\nnews conference.\n    Herrhausen said he was confident private consumption would\nsupport economic growth in West Germany this year, with net\nincome increases turning into purchasing power as long as\ninflation did not revive.\n    Herrhausen said he did not expect interest rates to rise in\nWest Germany this year, but there was little room for further\nfalls. Rates in the U.S. were however rising, as evidenced by\nthe latest prime rate moves, but this rise would be moderate.\n    Herrhausen said he did not expect any major narrowing of\nthe U.S. Trade and budget deficits in the next few months.\n    One success of the Paris agreement in February to foster\ncurrency stability was that U.S. Officials have stopped talking\ndown the dollar, he noted.\n    The recent stability would last until markets decided to\ntest the resolve of central banks, he said.\n    He noted that central banks had spent some 10 billion dlrs\nthis week to stabilize the dollar against the yen in the first\nsuch test.\n    \"A massive attack on the mark, which could come if we get\nbad news out of the U.S., Would require a much higher\nintervention amount, raising the danger of inflation,\" he said.\n    Turning to the international debt problem, Herrhausen said\nBrazil's unilateral debt moratorium had surprised banks.\n    But the move showed that a real solution to debt problems\nwas only possible with the involvement of all parties.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
