        "TITLE": "EC SUGAR TENDER HARD TO PREDICT - LONDON TRADE",
        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, April 8 - ",
        "BODY": "The outcome of today's European Community\n(EC) white sugar tender is extremely difficult to predict after\nlast week's substantial award of 102,350 tonnes at the highest\never rebate of 46.864 European currency units (Ecus) per 100\nkilos, traders said.\n    Some said they believed the tonnage would probably be\nsmaller, at around 60,000 tonnes, but declined to give a view\non the likely restitution. Last week, the European Commission\naccepted 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention by operators\nprotesting about low rebates. This might be a determining\nfactor in today's result, they added.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
