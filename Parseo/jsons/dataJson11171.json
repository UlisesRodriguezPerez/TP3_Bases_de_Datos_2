        "DATELINE": "    MELBOURNE, March 31 - ",
        "BODY": "Woodside Petroleum Ltd <WPLA.S> said\nits 1986 net loss largely reflected the drop in oil prices\ncombined with a large tax provision.\n    Woodside earlier reported attributable net loss rose to\n17.14 mln dlrs in 1986 from 8.73 mln in 1985, although group\nrevenue rose to 220.84 mln from 173.50 mln.\n    It said it should have received a 1.7 mln dlr tax credit\nbut instead made a 10.04 mln dlr tax provision. This largely\nrelated to its <Vamgas Ltd> unit, non-allowable exchange losses\nand tax benefits from the North-West Shelf project not\nrecognised in the accounts.\n    Woodside said the rise in revenue largely reflected full\nyear sales of gas and condensate from the domestic phase of the\nShelf project, against six month sales in 1985.\n    Offsetting this was a 23 pct fall in the Cooper Basin gas\nand liquids revenue of its 50.6 pct-owned Vamgas unit.\n    Since the balance date Woodside has accepted a Santos Ltd\n<STOS.S> takeover offer for Vamgas.\n    Woodside said a 92.8 mln dlr capital profit on the sale\nwould be included in the 1987 accounts.\n    It said it lifted capital spending on fixed assets to 269.6\nmln dlrs from 178.3 mln, mostly on the Shelf project.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
