        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, March 23 - ",
        "BODY": "<Dixons Group PLC> said it received a\nletter on March 19 from Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd, part of\nthe Cyacq investor group making a rival bid for Cyclops Corp\n<CYL>, proposing to drop the group's offer if Dixons would sell\nCyclops industrial businesses to Citicorp.\n    \"Cyacq's main equity investor appears ready to pull out and\ndeal directly with us for merely part of the company\" said\nDixons. \"It raises questions as to the strength of their\nconsortium and the purpose of their offer.\"\n    Dixons also said a U.S. Federal Court had refused a request\nby counsel for Cyacq, Audio/Video Affiliates Inc <AVA> and a\nshareholder plaintiff to prevent Dixons from\ncompleting its tender offer for Cyclops. It also said the court\nrefused to require Cyclops to provide Cyacq with confidential\ninformation previously provided to Dixons.\n    On Friday Cyacq Corp, an investor group led by Audio/Video\nAffiliates and Citicorp, raised their offer for Cyclops to\n92.50 dlrs per share from 80 dlrs per share, if certain\nconditions were satisfied.\n    Last week Dixons said it won out over rival bidders for\nCyclops after getting 54 pct of Cyclop's oustanding with a\n90.25 dlr or 384 mln dlr tender offer that expired March 18.\n    On Friday, Dixons agreed to reopen its tender offer until\nMarch 25, Wednesday.\n    Dixons today called Cyacq's higher 92.50 dlr a share offer\nfor Cyclops \"highly conditional.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
