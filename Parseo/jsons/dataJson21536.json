        "BODY": "A sharp rise in Soviet sugar consumption\nsince the start of the Kremlin's anti-alcohol drive indicates\nhome brewing is costing the state 20 billion roubles in lost\nvodka sales, Pravda said.\n    The Communist Party newspaper said sugar sales had\nincreased by one mln tonnes a year, enough to be turned into\ntwo billion bottles of moonshine.\n    At current vodka prices of 10 roubles a bottle, it said,\nthis meant illicit alcohol consumption had reached the\nequivalent of 20 billion roubles a year, or annual revenues\nfrom vodka sales before the May 1985 anti-alchohol decree.\n    \"Official statistics show a reduction in consumption of\nvodka, but this is a deceptive statistic -- it does not count\nhome-brew,\" Pravda said.\n    \"The epidemic first engulfed the villages and has now also\nfirmly settled into cities, where the availability of natural\ngas, running water and privacy has made it much easier.\"\n    Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev launched the anti-alcohol\ncampaign shortly after taking office in March 1985 as a first\nstep to improving Soviet economic performance, which had been\nseriously hurt by drunkenness among the working population.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
