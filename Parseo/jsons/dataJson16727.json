        "TITLE": "MERRILL TO GET 30 MLN DLR FEE IN BORG <BOR> DEAL",
        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, April 13 - ",
        "BODY": "Merrill Lynch and Co Inc <MER>\nsubsidiary seeking to take over of Borg-Warner Corp said it\ncould realize a 30 mln dlr fee for its efforts, whether or not\nthe deal, which it values at 4.7 billion dlrs, succeeds.\n    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,\nMerrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc said it would receive a 30\nmln dlr fee from the surviving company for acting as dealer\nmanager of the merger after the Borg-Warner deal is completed.\n    But it said it could also receive a break-up fee of 30 mln\ndlrs if the deal fails for reasons, which include another party\nholding more than 40 pct of its stock or tendering for 50 pct.\n    The 30 mln dlr fee is among the highest set down in any\ntender offer agreement, either in compensation for dealer\nmanager services or for break-up of the deal.\n    Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, backed by a group of\ninvestors it organized, has launched a 48.50 dlr a share tender\noffer for Borg-Warner for 90 pct of its stock.\n    The company's board has approved the plan, which was\nintended to thwart an unsolicited offer from GAF Corp.\n    Borg-Warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding Series A\npreferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr a\nshare exercise price before the merger is effective, it said.\n    Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possible\nleveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December.\n    At that time, Merrill Lynch told the company it would\nconsider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities,\nif the Borg-Warner board approved, it said. On Feb 24, it said\nit was told the company had decided against a buyout.\n    But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr a\nshare proposal on March 31, Merrill Lynch said.\n    Unlike its earlier proposal, Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warner\nmanagement was asked not to take part in the new deal and it\nwas conditioned upon payment of the fees.\n    In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will also\nget up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses in\nthe tender offer.\n    Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warner\nas a subsidiary with its current officers keeping their\npositions.\n    But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it is\nconsidering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number of\nsubsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger.\n    All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130\nmln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal.\n    Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debt\nof Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said.\n    To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects to\nborrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mln\ndlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs of\nnon-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynch\nand Co, sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes to\nMerrill Lynch and Co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs of\nsubordinated discount debentures.\n    GAF has raised its offer to 48 dlrs a share cash.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
