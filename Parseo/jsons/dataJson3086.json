        "TITLE": "GENCORP<GY> UNIT TO SELL LOS ANGELES TV STATION",
        "DATELINE": "    AKRON, Ohio, March 9 - ",
        "BODY": "Gencorp said its RKO General\nsubsidiary agreed to sell KHJ-TV in Los Angeles to Walt Disney\nCo <DIS> for 217 mln dlrs cash plus working capital and other\nadjustments at closing.\n    The company said under the agreement in principle, RKO's\napplication to renew the station's broadcast license would be\ndismissed and the competing application of Fidelity Television\nwould be granted. Disney would then acquire privately held\nFidelity for about 103 mln dlrs and other adjustments.\n    Renewal of the KHJ-TV license has been challenged in\nregulatory proceedings for more than 20 years.\n    The deal is subject to prior approval by the Federal\nCommunications Commission, the company said.\n    Late in 1985, Gencorp cut a deal with Fidelity, a Los\nAngeles investor group, and Westinghouse Electric Corp <WX> to\nsettle the license proceedings and sell KHJ-TV for 313 mln\ndlrs, 70 pct of which would go to Westinghouse and the\nremainder to Fidelity. But on Jan 28, 1987, Westinghouse\nwithdrew from the deal because the FCC would not approve it.\n    In early 1986, Gencorp and RKO agreed to sell WOR-TV in\nSecaucus, N.J., to MCA Inc <MCA> for 387 mln dlrs. The FCC has\napproved the transaction, but several parties have appealed.\n    The FCC has not said when it would rule on the appeals,\naccording to a spokemsan for Akron, Ohio-based Gencorp.\n    Fidelity Television originally filed a competing\napplication for the RKO license for KHJ, an independent\nstation, in 1965.\n    In 1980, the FCC disqualified RKO as licensee of WNAC-TV in\nBoston, citing anti-competitive trade practices and inaccurate\nfinancial reporting to the agency, causing renewals previously\ngranted to RKO in New York, for WOR, and Los Angeles, for KHJ,\nto be denied.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
