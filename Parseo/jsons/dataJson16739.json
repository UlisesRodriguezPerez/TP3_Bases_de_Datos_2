        "BODY": "Ecuador will resume limited crude output\nnext week to fill up storage tanks as a first step to pump oil\nto a Colombian pipeline on May one, the state Ecuadorean\nPetroleum Corp (CEPE) said.\n    CEPE manager Carlos Romoleroux told reporters that Ecuador\nwould begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude in\nnortheastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week in\npreparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link-up to\nneighbouring Colombia.\n    Oil production in Ecuador was halted on March five when an\nearthquake damaged the country's main pipeline from Lago Agrio,\nat the heart of the Ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacific\nport of Balao.\n    It will take at least until the end of July to repair the\npipeline and return output to normal levels. The country was\npumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor.\n    To resume limited output in the meantime, Ecuador is\nconstructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup, capable of carrying\n55,000 bpd, from Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon, the starting point\nof Colombia's pipeline to the Pacific port of Tumaco.\n    The original target date to resume limited crude output was\nMay eight, the scheduled date for the inauguration of the Lago\nAgrio to Puerto Colon pipeline, an energy ministry spokesman\nsaid.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
