        "DATELINE": "    TOKYO, June 18 - ",
        "BODY": "Toshiba Corp <TSBA.T> and Sharp Corp\n<SHRP.T> decided to maintain exports of lap-top personal\ncomputers to the European Community (EC) at last year's levels,\ndespite the halt of shipments to the U.S., Company spokesmen\ntold Reuters.\n    They said the voluntary restraints were aimed at averting\nEC sanctions urged by European computer makers. The Europeans\nfeared Japanese personal computers would flood EC markets after\nWashington imposed 100 pct tariffs last April.\n    Toshiba and Sharp together control about 40 pct of the\npersonal computer market in the EC, the Sharp spokesman said.\n    Toshiba said exports of T1100 and T3100 lap-top computers\nwould continue at 5,000 units a month for the time being.\n    Sharp said exports to the EC of PC 7000 series lap-top\npersonal computers would continue at last year's level of\n12,000 to 16,000 units a year.\n    Washington imposed the tariffs because of Japan's alleged\nfailure to uphold a 1986 agreement on semiconductor trade.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
