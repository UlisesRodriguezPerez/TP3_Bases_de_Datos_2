        "BODY": "Exxon Corp said that 1986's 15 pct\nincrease in earnings per share to 7.42 dlrs a share were\npartially based on its streamlined operations which compensated\nfor the weakness in its exploration earnings and the lowest\ncrude oil prices in a decade.\n    Exxon said economies introduced in its operations from\nreductions in personnel and other savings, such as reductions\nin exploration expenses, were reflected in an 880 mln dlr\nreduction in consolidated operating costs from 1985.\n    The company said its more efficient operations would be\nnecessary to offset more adverse oil market conditions ahead.\n    The company also said that its share repurchase plan\ncontributed to the per share gains over 1985.\n    In a breakdown of costs, Exxon said that operating expenses\nslipped to 9.2 billion dlrs in 1986 from 9.7 billion dlrs the\nprevious year and exploration expenses, including dry holes,\nslipped back to 1.2 billion dlrs from 1.5 billion dlrs over the\nsame period as the number of wells drilled was lower.\n    The company was also able to use lower interest rates to\nreduce its interest expenses to 614 mln dlrs in 1986 from 627\nmln dlrs the previous year.\n    Exxon said that the ratio of debt to capital was cut by 1.6\npct in 1986 from the previous year to 19 pct.\n    On December 31, 1986 Exxon's total debt of 7.87 billion\ndlrs was down slightly from the previous year's 7.9 billion\ndlrs and long term debt stood at 4.3 billion dlrs, down from\n4.8 billion dlrs in 1985.\n    Exxon's policy of repurchasing shares on the market for its\ntreasury also contributed to earnings results by a reduction of\nshares to 722.6 mln shares from 754.1 mln shares the previous\nyear.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
