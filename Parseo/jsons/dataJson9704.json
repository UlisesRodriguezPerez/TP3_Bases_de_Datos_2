        "BODY": "The European Community (EC) considers\ntalks on agricultural trade reform to be inseperable from talks\non other trade reform in the present GATT round, Willy de\nClercq, external relations commissioner of the EC, said.\n    He told reporters here the EC would not bow to pressure to\nreach an early, seperate agreement on agricultural trade.\n    He said the EC wanted to stick to the four-year schedule\nagreed by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n(GATT) in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year. That included\nagricultural trade liberalisation for the first time in the\nlengthy program to re-negotiate the GATT.\n    Other trade issues being discussed in the current GATT\nround include reform of trade in merchandise and services.\n    De Clercq is on his way to China after attending a two-day\nconference for 22 GATT trade ministers held in New Zealand.\n    Several of those ministers criticised the EC for what they\nsaw as restrictive agricultural trade practices and called for\nurgent reforms. U.S. Trade representative, Clayton Yeutter,\nalso said it was important agreement on agricultural trade\nreform was reached as early as possible.\n    But de Clercq said the GATT program had been reached after\nlong and hard negotiations, and the EC did not want changes.\n    \"We just want to stick to the agreement which was reached,\nand that was very clear -- that the new round would be one\nundertaking. It is a global negotiation with no two tracks, no\nfast track, no slow track. It has just one track, the track -\nand that's all,\" de Clercq said.\n    \"If you start selecting priorities, your priority is not my\npriority. We say that agriculture is urgent, but it's not the\nonly urgent thing,\" he said.\n    He said the Punte del Este agreement had taken eight months\nto prepare and eight days of negotiations.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
