        "DATELINE": "    CHICAGO, April 27 - ",
        "BODY": "The Commodity Credit Corporation late\nFriday readjusted county price differentials for PIK corn\nredemptions traded off the Louisiana Gulf, according to a CCC\nspokesman at the Kansas City Agricultural Stabilization and\nConservation Service, ASCS, office.\n    He said the adjusted differentials supersede the\nadjustments made March 30. They represent an increase over the\noriginal differentials but are lower than the differential\nadjustments recently made.\n    For differentials of five to 15 cents, CCC added one cent.\nFor 16-25 cents add two cents, for 26-35 cts add three cts, for\n36-45 cts add four cts and for 46-55 cts add five cts.\n    The recent drop in barge freight rates prompted the\nadjustments, the source said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
