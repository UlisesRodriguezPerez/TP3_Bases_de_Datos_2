        "BODY": "Jacobs Suchard AG <JACZ.Z> hopes for\nanother excellent year in 1987 after a 27 pct increase in 1986\nnet profit. Results in the first few months show it heading in\nthe right direction, company president Klaus Jacobs said.\n    The group reported 1986 net profit of 190.9 mln Swiss\nfrancs compared with 150.4 mln in 1985 and raised its dividend\nper bearer share to 160 francs from 155 francs.\n    Jacobs said the increase in profit, which far exceeded the\ncompany's target of five pct real annual growth, had been made\npossible by restructuring measures introduced in January 1986\nwhich had also made some major acquisitions possible last year.\n    Hermann Pohl, general director in charge of economic\naffairs, said the 2.7 pct decline in group turnover to 5.24\nbillion francs was due to currency factors.\n    A 5.2 pct negative currency influence was partially offset\nby growth in operations and by structural changes within the\ngroup.\n    Turnover in the coffee business fell to 3.10 billion francs\nfrom 3.56 billion in 1985 while turnover in the chocolate\nsector rose to 2.14 billion francs from 1.82 billion. The\ntonnage sold in both sectors declined due to higher prices and\nlower consumer demand, especially in France and West Germany.\n    Jacobs Suchard increased its market share in West Germany\nto 44.9 pct from 39.9 pct in 1985, largely as a result of\nacquisitions. Market share in France was little changed at 25\npct against 25.3 pct.\n    Pohl said the group's average tax rate rose to 32.5 pct\nfrom 28.8 pct because of the higher profits and despite\nwrite-offs on the losses of new acquisitions. A further\nincrease in tax levels was expected in future.\n    Taxes jumped 51.3 pct to 92 mln francs in 1986 from 61 mln\nthe previous year.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
