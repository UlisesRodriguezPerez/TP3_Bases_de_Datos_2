        "BODY": "The U.S. warned its major\ntrade partners that its trade deficit must fall by September or\na protectionist trade bill from Congress would be highly\nlikely.\n    Meanwhile, European Community (EC) external trade chief\nWilly de Clercq said that if Japan's trade surplus, which hit\nalmost 90 billion dlrs last year, continued so high, there\nwould be stormy weather ahead.\n    U.S. Trade representative Clayton Yeutter told trade\nleaders from Japan, the EC and Canada that there was at least a\n50-50 chance that a protectionist bill reaching the House of\nRepresentatives this week would pass the Senate in September.\n    The U.S. economy badly needed better trade figures by then,\nor President Ronald Reagan would have a difficult time vetoing\nsuch a bill, he said, according to a series of briefings to\nreporters by official delegates at the weekend meeting.\n    A 15 billion dlr U.S. Trade deficit in March had only\nincensed Congress further, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
