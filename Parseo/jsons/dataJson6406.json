        "BODY": "New Zealand's inflation and interest\nrates should decline and the balance of payments improve\nsignificantly in the fiscal year to the end of March 1988, the\nInstitute of Economic Research (NZIER) said.\n    The independent institute said in its quarterly March issue\nthat it was also revising its fiscal 1987 real gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) forecast to a fall of 0.5 pct against the one pct\ndrop forecast in December.\n    Government figures show GDP grew at an annual 1.8 pct in\nthe quarter to September and 3.4 pct in the June quarter.\n    The NZIER said the sharp improvement in the June and\nSeptember quarters was due mainly to a new tax structure and\nthe introduction of a 10 pct value-added goods and services tax\nand is not expected to continue in the second half of 1986/87.\n    The government's tight fiscal position is not expected to\nchange, it said.\n    Annual inflation, measured by the consumer price index, is\nforecast to fall to nine pct by next March from 18.2 pct in\ncalendar 1986, it said.\n    \"Falling inflation is likely to give significant scope for\nreductions in nominal interest rates; real interest rates are\nalso expected to ease (albeit slightly) as the balance of\npayments deficit and hence the call on overseas capital, falls\naway,\" the NZIER said.\n    Short-term interest rates are forecast to remain between 20\nand 25 pct until the June quarter, but will decline over the\nsecond half of 1987/88 to between 16 and 18 pct. Long-term\nrates are expected to fall to between 14 and 16 pct.\n    Five year government bond rates are currently 18.40 pct and\nthe key indicator 30-day bank bills 26.53 pct.\n    The local dollar is expected to depreciate steadily in the\nearly part of the coming year and, by next March, reach 57.5 on\nthe Reserve Bank's trade weighted index, which is based on a\nbasket of currencies. The index now stands at around 66.4.\n    \"A marked improvement in the balance of payments is\nforecast,\" the NZIER said. \"The current account deficit is\nexpected to fall from 7.5 pct of GDP in 1985/86 to 4.5 pct in\n1986/87 and 2.5 pct in 1987/88.\"\n    The current account deficit is forecast to shrink to 1.32\nbillion N.Z. Dlrs in 1987/88 from 2.40 billion in 1986/87 and\n3.33 billion in 1985/86.\n    The 1987/88 budget deficit is forecast to be 2.8 billion\ndlrs against an expected 2.9 billion dlrs in 1986/87 and 1.87\nbillion in 1985/86.\n    This compares with the government's 1986/87 deficit figure\nof 2.92 billion against an earlier forecast of 2.45 billion.\n    \"Conditions in the coming year are sufficiently subdued to\ncontribute to marked improvements in both the balance of\npayments and the rate of inflation ...,\" the NZIER said.\n    \"Overall, these are significant gains for the New Zealand\neconomy and, if they continue to be improved upon, bode well\nfor future prospects.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003"
