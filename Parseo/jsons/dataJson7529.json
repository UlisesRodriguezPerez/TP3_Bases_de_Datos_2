        "BODY": "President Reagan said the United\nStates must do more to lessen its reliance on imported oil.\n    President Reagan said during a nationally televised news\nconference that the rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil is a\nproblem that the administration is studying.\n    \"We have to study this more,\" Reagan said. \"This is why we\nincreased the Strategic (Petroleum) Reserve, but we have to do\nmore,\" he said.\n    Reagan said his administration has already proposed\nderegulating natural gas and eliminating the windfall profits\ntax on crude oil production.\n    However, he complained that Congress had not yet approved\nthose measures.\n    The Department of Energy earlier this week released a\nreport that warned of rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil\nimports at a time when domestic production is declining. It\nsuggested options for the administration to consider, but made\nno specific recommendations.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
