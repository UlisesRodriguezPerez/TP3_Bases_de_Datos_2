        "BODY": "Taiwan and the U.S. Have revised and\nextended their textile export agreement after negotiations in\nWashington this week, a spokesman for the Taiwan Textile\nFederation said.\n    Charles Chen told Reuters the original three year accord\nhas been extended by one year to the end of 1989. The U.S. Has\nagreed to raise the limit on annual growth of Taiwan's textile\nand apparel exports to one pct from 0.5 pct for calendar 1989,\nhe said. \"The new accord is more fair and gives breathing space\nto our textile makers (so they can) diversify their exports to\nother nations,\" he added.\n    Chen said the revised agreement puts Taiwan on similar\ntextile exporting terms to Hong Kong and South Korea. But\ndespite the changes, Taiwanese firms have lost orders to rivals\nin Hong Kong and South Korea because of the strong Taiwan\ndollar, he said. The Taiwan currency has risen 17 pct against\nthe U.S. Dollar since September 1985 while the Korean won rose\nby some six pct and the Hong Kong dollar was stable.\n    Taiwan's textile exports to the U.S. Amounted to 2.8\nbillion U.S. Dlrs last year out of total exports to the U.S. Of\n7.8 billion. Textile exports are expected to remain the same\nthis year, Chen said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
