        "BODY": "Kloeckner & Co KGaA, the\ninternational trading group, said its 1986 domestic group net\nprofit fell by around 20 pct against 1985, adding that the\nprofit resulted largely from a writing back of reserves.\n    The company, which gave no 1986 profit figures, posted a\ndomestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985.\n    It said the 1986 profit was made possible through a 40 mln\nmark write-back of reserves that had been created to cover\npossible price rises. These reserves were no longer necessary\nbecause of recent declines in raw material prices.\n    Kloeckner attributed the profit decline to the fall in\nprices as well as the lower value of the dollar.\n    It said it would pay an unchanged dividend on its ordinary\nshare capital, which is entirely in private hands and held\nlargely by family foundations.\n    Kloeckner's nominal 100 mark profit-participation\ncertificates, issued in October 1986, will pay a likely yield\nof around 10 pct. Holders of the certificates are entitled to a\nquarter of the 1986 payment, or around 2.50 marks, the company\nadded.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
