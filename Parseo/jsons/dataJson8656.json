        "BODY": "A ban by a Portuguese court on the\nstate buying agency EPAC taking part in cereals import tenders\nopen to private traders will remain unless it is reversed in\nPortugal or challenged in the European Court of Justice,\nEuropean Commission sources said.\n    They denied a statement yesterday by Portuguese Agriculture\nMinister Alvaro Barreto that the commission had accepted that\nEPAC should be eligible, saying it had taken no view in the\nmatter.\n    Under the terms of Portugal's accession to the European\nCommunity, a grain import monopoly held by EPAC is being\nreduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in\n1990.\n    Lisbon's civil court decided in a preliminary ruling\nearlier this month that EPAC should not be allowed to take\npart, as it had done in the past, in tenders for the\nliberalised share of annual grain imports.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
