        "BODY": "Japan's cabinet approved a plan to help\nfinancially-troubled aluminium ventures in Indonesia and\nBrazil, an official at the Ministry of International and Trade\nIndustry (MITI) said.\n    Japan will invest 24 billion yen in <PT Indonesia Asahan\nAluminium> in addition to the 68.3 billion yen already invested\nin the company. The government and private interests will\nequally share the additional investment, he said.\n    They will also provide equal shares in 6.3 billion yen in\nnew investment in the Albras Amazon aluminium project in\nBrazil, in addition to the 45.7 billion yen already invested.\n    The Japan Export-Import Bank will cut its rates on loans to\nAsahan and Albras to about five pct from about seven pct, the\nofficial said.\n    Interest rates on loans by Japan's private banks to the two\nprojects are expected to be reduced to around five pct from the\ncurrent seven to eight pct, but an agreement has yet to be\nreached, industry sources said.\n    Under the rescue scheme for Asahan, in which 91.1 billion\nyen has been invested, Indonesia will also extend another 32\nbillion yen to the company.  This will raise Indonesia's\ninvestment ratio to about 40 pct from the current 25 pct.\n    The Brazilian government has already agreed to invest an\nadditional 6.5 billion yen in Albras, in which investment now\ntotals 93.2 billion yen, but its stake will not change from 51\npct, the official said.\n    The sources said the rescue programs for the two projects\nwere larger than earlier expected, reflecting Japan's desire to\nhelp develop the economies of Indonesia and Brazil and to\nstabilise sources of aluminium.\n    Japan depends on imports for more than 90 pct of its\naluminium demand, which totals some 1.8 mln tonnes a year, they\nsaid.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
