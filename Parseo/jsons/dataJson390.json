        "BODY": "Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd <CKGH.HK>\nis expecting strong results this year after reporting better\nthan expected profits in 1986, chairman Li Ka-shing said.\n    He did not give a specific earnings projection but he told\nreporters the firm will pay total dividends of not less than 19\ncents a share this year after a one-for-four bonus issue and a\nfour-for-one stock split.\n    The company earlier declared total dividends equal to 15\ncents a share for 1986, adjusting for the stock split and bonus\nissue.\n    Cheung Kong's earnings rose to 1.28 billion H.K. Dlrs in\n1986, well above market expectations of 920 mln to one billion\ndlrs. They compared with profits of 551.7 mln dlrs in 1985.\n    Cheung Kong also reported extraordinary gains of 983.6 mln\ndlrs mainly from the firm's sale of the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel\nto Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd <HKEH.HK> for one billion\ndlrs. It had gains of 81.3 mln dlrs in 1985.\n    Li attributed the surge in 1986 earnings to a buoyant local\nproperty market and substantial increases in contributions from\nassociated companies.\n    \"Looking ahead, 1987 should be another year of stability for\nthe property market,\" Li said. \"The growth in (Hong Kong's)\nexports is expected to stimulate the demand for industrial\nbuildings.\"\n    Cheung Kong is cash rich and is looking for new projects in\nthe British colony, Li said, noting the firm is interested in a\nland reclamation project along the Hong Kong harbour and is\nexchanging views with the government on a proposal to build a\nsecond airport.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
