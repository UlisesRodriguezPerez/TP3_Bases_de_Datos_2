        "BODY": "Japan is expected to post a 3.6 pct rise\nin real gross national product in 1987/88, higher than the\nofficial 3.5 pct target, a private economic institute said.\n    The Research Institute on National Economy said in a report\nthe economy will start picking up in the April-June quarter,\npartly because of an improvement in earnings performance and\ncapital spending in manufacturing industries.\n    The institute assumed an average exchange rate in the year\nstarting April 1 of 150 yen to the dollar. It predicted the\nBank of Japan will not change the official discount rate in the\nyear.\n    The institute forecast that Japan's exports will gradually\nrise in the year in volume terms as the dollar's fall in the\npast 18 months is likely to help prop up the U.S. Economy.\n    Japan's trade surplus is expected to narrow slightly to\n90.2 billion dlrs in 1987/88 ending March 31 from an estimated\n98 billion in the current fiscal year, it said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
