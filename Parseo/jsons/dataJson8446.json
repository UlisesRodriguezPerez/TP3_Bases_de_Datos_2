        "DATELINE": "    BRUSSELS, March 23 - ",
        "BODY": "The EC Commission will decide shortly\nprecisely how to arrange the import of third country maize and\nsorghum into the EC in fulfilment of its agreement with the\nUnited States, Commission sources said.\n    Under the accord, reached following U.S. complaints about\nthe impact on its agricultural exports of Spanish EC\nmembership, the EC will import two mln tonnes of maize and\n300,000 tonnes of sorghum a year up to end of 1990.\n    All this produce will be imported into Spain at special\nlevy levels likely to be below those applying for imports into\nother EC countries.\n    The sources said it was possible that the Spanish\nintervention board would be asked to buy the produce directly\nthis year, as it was rather late to make other arrangements.\n    They added that the choice for future years appears to lie\nbetween a system of regular tenders and the setting of a daily\nspecial levy applicable to Spanish imports.\n    There will initially be no tax on re-exports of maize and\nsorghum from Spain to other EC countries, although such a tax\ncould be imposed later, the sources added.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
