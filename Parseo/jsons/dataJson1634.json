        "TITLE": "OUTBOARD MARINE <OM> RISING ON TAKEOVER RUMOR",
        "DATELINE": "    CHICAGO, March 4 - ",
        "BODY": "Wall Street traders said the stock of\nOutboard Marine Corp was rising on a rumor over a cable\ntelevision program that Outboard is a likely takeover target of\nSun Chemical Corp <SNL>.\n    Outboard was up 3-1/8 to 34-5/8. On Tuesday it rose 1-3/8\nto 31-1/2 Tuesday.\n    A report on Cable News Network today said Sun Chemical has\n4.9 pct of Outboard and is conducting a study on whether to go\nfor control of the whole company.\n    An Outboard Marine spokesman would not comment on the\nrumor.\n    The cable program said a buyout of Outboard would be for up\nto 40 dlrs a share, or for a total of 680 mln dlrs.\n    A spokesman for Sun Chemical was not immediately available.\n    Outboard Marine last June adopted a shareholder rights plan\nthat will be triggered when a person or group acquires\nbeneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of its common or begins\na tender offer that would result in 30 pct ownership.\n    Wayne Jones, vice president at Outboard for strategic\nplanning, said management wants to stay independent. \"We are\nnot trying to sell the company. We are proceeding with our\nstrategic plans,\" he said.\n    That plan includes integrating five boat companies that\nOutboard Marine has bought since the middle of December. Jones\nsaid all five will cost between 100 mln dlrs to 120 mln dlrs.\n    An analyst who wanted anonymity said 40 dlrs a share is a\n\"decent\" price for outboard. \"A bdding war to 50 or 60 dlrs a\nshare is stretching it. Maybe 45 dlrs a share tops,\" he said.\n    Outboard, which has 17 mln shares outstanding, is in\nregistration for a two mln common share offering with Morgan\nStanley Inc. It makes sense, the analyst said, for Sun Chemical\nto strike before the offering is underway.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
