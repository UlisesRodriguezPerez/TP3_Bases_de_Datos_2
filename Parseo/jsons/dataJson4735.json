        "BODY": "Employers in Rotterdam port's\nstrike-hit general cargo sector have been served with an\ninjunction until May 7 preventing them from continuing with\nplans for 350 redundancies this year, an employers'\norganisation spokesman said.\n    An Amsterdam court yesterday ruled there had been a legal\nfault in the employers' redundancy procedure.\n    The employers' spokesman said they were likely to restart\nthe redundancy procedure afresh next week in an attempt to\npre-empt the May 7 final court ruling.\n    Port and transport union representative Paul Rosenmuller\ndescribed the court ruling as a victory for the union, but\nadded there was still a long way to go before the dispute that\nhas hit the general cargo sector for the past eight weeks was\nresolved.\n    Rosenmuller said there would be a meeting of the sector's\n4,000 workers this afternoon to decide on further action in the\ncampaign of lightning strikes that began on January 19 in\nprotest at planned redundancies of 800, starting with 350 this\nyear.\n    The employers said there were no immediate plans for\nmeetings with the union either on the proposed redundancies or\non a new work practice agreement in the sector.\n    Meanwhile, discussions on a new work agreement in the\nport's grain sector, due to resume next week, are stalemated,\nalthough agreement could be close in the coal and ore sector,\nthe employers' spokesman added.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
