        "BODY": "State-owned <Chemie Linz AG> is\nlikely to record a 1986 loss of some 600 mln schillings\ncompared with a 340 mln loss in 1985, a company spokesman said.\n    Falling sales and lower world prices of fertilisers were\nlargely responsible for the sharp increase, along with the\neffects of the dollar's fall which has helped to give U.S.\nFibre producers a competitive edge, he told Reuters.\n    The firm would have made a small profit in 1985 had it not\nbeen for 456 mln schillings lost by subsidiary <Merx\nHandelsgesmbH> on oil trading. Merx has since withdrawn from\nthe oil market. The firm will announce 1986 results in July.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
