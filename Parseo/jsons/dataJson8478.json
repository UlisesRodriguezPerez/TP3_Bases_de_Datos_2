        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 23 - ",
        "BODY": "Energy analyst Edward Krapels said\nthe United States should consider an oil tariff to keep U.S.\ndependence on imports below 50 pct.\n    \"On the supply side, the argument in favor of a contingent,\nvariable import tariff is most persuasive,\" Krapels, president\nof Energy Security Analysis, Inc said in a statement at a House\nEnergy and Power subcommittee hearing.\n    \"An optimal tariff would be one implemented only if the\ninternational price of crude oil falls below, say, 15 dlrs a\nbarrel. On the demand side, the obvious policy is an excise tax\non transportation fuels,\" Krapels said.\n    But William Johnson of the Jofree Corp disagreed with the\noil tariff proposal, saying Congress should remove price\ncontrols on natural gas, repeal the windfall profits tax on oil\ncompanies, allow exports of Alaskan oil and provide tax\nincentives for U.S. oil production, or, at the least, preserve\nexisiting tax incentives for drilling. He also urging filling\nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate.\n    Richard Adkerson of Arthur Andersen and Co told the\nsubcommittee oil imports were expected to increase because\nfunds for exploration and development of domestic oil sources\ncannot now be economically justified due to low oil prices.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
