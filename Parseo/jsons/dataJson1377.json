        "BODY": "The Australian Government will likely\nreimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.)\ndlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S.\nAgriculture Department said.\n    In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the\ndepartment said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has\nreduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels\ninsufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at\naround 98 dlrs per tonne.\n     For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5\nmln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the\nbreakeven export price, it said.\n    Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance\npayment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculated\nat 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current\nyear and the two lowest of the previous three years, the\ndepartment said.\n    In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and\nstorage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives.\n    But the department said the Australian Bureau of\nAgricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production will\ndrop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in\n1989/90.\n    The decline will result from low world grain prices leading\nto shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S.\nwheat exports, the department said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
