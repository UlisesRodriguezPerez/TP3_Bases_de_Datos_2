        "BODY": "The outcome of negotiations on\nproposals by the European Commission for a 330 Ecus a tonne tax\non EC-produced and imported oilseeds and marine oils remains\ndifficult to predict, Belgian agriculture minister Paul de\nKeersmaeker told a news conference.\n    De Keersmaeker, who chaired a meeting of EC farm ministers\nwhich ended today, was asked about reports enough countries\nwere against the tax to ensure that it would be defeated in\nnegotiations on the EC farm price package for 1987/88.\n    He said it was true some countries were strongly opposed,\nbut others were less so and others basically in favour.\n    \"I think there is room for negotiations, and I would not\nwant to make any predictions at this stage,\" de Keersmaeker\nsaid.\n    Yesterday, British minister Michael Jopling said Britain,\nWest Germany, Portugal, the Netherlands and Denmark were\nopposed to the measure. Between them these countries have more\nthan enough voting power to block it.\n    Diplomatic sources said at today's meeting the Spanish\ndelegation also expressed strong reservations about the idea.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
