In 1982 it posted a profit of 329 mln.\n    The company said in a statement that cash flow had improved\nstrongly although it remained negative at 182 mln francs\nagainst 1.34 billion in 1985, due largely to improved\nperformances by its main profit centres.\n    It said the results could have been even better had it not\nbeen for the collapse of refining and sales profit margins in\nthe last quarter of the year.\n    In 1986 Shell sold 14.74 mln tonnes of oil products against\n14.52 mln tonnes in 1985.\n    The company said the results were in line with its targets\nfor the second year of its three-year recovery programme.\n    Meanwhile, <Societe Shell Chimie) said it also returned to\nprofit in 1986, for the first time since 1976, posting net\nprofit of 160 mln francs against a 1985 loss of 57 mln.
