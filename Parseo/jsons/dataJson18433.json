Last year's performance\nwas the worst since 1974/75, when gnp contracted by 0.4 pct,\nand was below the government's revised three pct forecast.\n    Economists said the strong yen was largely to blame for the\nslowdown in economic growth in 1986/87.\n    Domestic demand increased 0.7 pct in the January/March\nquarter and 4.3 pct in the fiscal year, compared with growth of\n0.6 pct in October/December and 3.7 pct in 1985/86.\n    The annualized growth rate in the January/March quarter\naccelerated to 4.9 pct, from 2.9 pct in October/December.\n    In nominal terms, gnp rose 0.7 pct in January/March, after\na 0.5 pct October/December rise, reflecting lower prices.\n    Domestic demand contributed 0.7 percentage point to real\ngnp growth in January/March, while foreign trade added 0.5\npoint. In October/December domestic demand contributed 0.6\npoint, while foreign trade added 0.2 point.\n    Of the 0.5 point contribution of foreign trade to gnp last\nquarter, rising exports accounted for 0.3 point and falling\nimports contributed 0.2.\n    Total export volume rose 2.0 pct quarter-on-quarter in\nJanuary/March, while imports fell 1.2 pct.\n    Of the 0.7 point contribution of domestic demand to\nJanuary/March gnp growth, the private sector accounted for 1.1\npoint while the public sector knocked off 0.4.\n    The private sector contribution included 0.4 point for\ncorporate capital outlays and 1.0 for consumer spending, while\ndestocking subtracted 0.3 point.\n    In 1986/87, domestic demand contributed 4.1 percentage\npoints to growth while foreign trade knocked off 1.5 points.\n    In 1985/86, the domestic demand contribution was 3.6 points\nand foreign trade 0.7 point.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
