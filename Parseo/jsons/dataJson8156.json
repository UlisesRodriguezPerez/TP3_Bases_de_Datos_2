        "BODY": "Philippines Trade and\nIndustry Secretary Jose Concepcion told world trade ministers\nhe wondered if their agreement was of any real value after the\nEuropean Community (EC) imposed a levy on vegetable oils.\n    Concepcion, speaking at an informal meeting of the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) here, said ministers\ndeclared in Uruguay last September that the trade of\nless-developed nations should not be disrupted.\n    He said the EC not only ignored Manila's request for lower\ntariffs on coconut oil but introduced a levy on vegetable oils\nand fats that are vital exports for Southeast Asian countries.\n    Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the EC\nCouncil of Ministers, he noted that \"I cannot help but wonder\nwhether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are of\nany real value.\"\n    He also said industrialised nations saved about 65 billion\nU.S. Dlrs in 1985 through low commodity prices, but this had\naffected the ability of developing nations to import goods and\nservices.\n    \"The health and the growth of world trade requires that the\nnew development of developing countries losing their share of\nworld trade be arrested and reversed,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
