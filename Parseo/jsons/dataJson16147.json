        "BODY": "China has raised the state purchase\nprices of corn, rice, cottonseed and shelled peanuts from April\n1 to encourage farmers to grow them, the official China\nCommercial Daily said.\n    The paper said the price paid for corn from 14 northern\nprovinces, cities and regions has increased by one yuan per 50\nkg. A foreign agricultural expert said the rise will take the\nprice to 17 fen per jin (0.5 kg) from 16 fen.\n    The paper said the price for long-grained rice from 10\nsouthern provinces and cities was raised by 1.5 yuan per 50 kg.\n    The paper said the price for round-grained rice from 11\nprovinces, regions and cities in central, east and northwest\nChina has been increased by 1.75 yuan per 50 kg. It gave no\nmore price details.\n    It said local authorities must inform farmers of the price\nincreases before farmers begin planting, to encourage\nproduction of grains and oilseeds.\n    Chinese officials have said farmers are unwilling to grow\ngrain because they can earn more from other crops.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
