        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, April 2 - ",
        "BODY": "Interest rates on the London money market\nwere slightly firmer on news U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer\nNigel Lawson had stated target rates for sterling against the\ndollar and mark, dealers said.\n    They said this had come as a surprise and expected the\ntargets, 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs, to be promptly tested in the\nforeign exchange markets. Sterling opened 0.3 points lower in\ntrade weighted terms at 71.3.\n    Dealers noted the chancellor said he would achieve his\ngoals on sterling by a combination of intervention in currency\nmarkets and interest rates.\n    Operators feel the foreign exchanges are likely to test\nsterling on the downside and that this seems to make a fall in\nU.K. Base lending rates even less likely in the near term,\ndealers said.\n    The feeling remains in the market, however, that\nfundamental factors have not really changed and that a rise in\nU.K. Interest rates is not very likely. The market is expected\nto continue at around these levels, reflecting the current 10\npct base rate level, for some time.\n    The key three months interbank rate was 1/16 point firmer\nat 10 9-7/8 pct.\n\u0003"
