        "TITLE": "ENIM OIL SIGNS CONTRACT WITH INDONESIA'S PERTAMINA",
        "DATELINE": "    JAKARTA, April 6 - ",
        "BODY": "<Enim Oil Co Ltd>, a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of <Southern Cross Ltd> of Colorado, signed a\nproduction sharing contract with Indonesia's state oil company\nPertamina to explore for oil in the Lematang block of Sumatra.\n    It was the second production sharing contract signed by\nPertamina this year. Three contracts were awarded in 1986.\n    The agreement, signed at a public ceremony in the presence\nof Energy Minister Subroto, calls for the standard oil\nproduction split of 85-15 pct in Pertamina's favour.\n    Hong Kong-based Enim Oil is contracted to spend 120 mln\ndlrs over the next six years, including 10 mln in the first two\nyears.\n    The 1,137 sq km Lematang block is located between two oil\nproducing sectors of South Sumatra, and Enim officials said\nthere is a good chance of getting a high return on investment.\n    A spokesman said the area, which has not been drilled\nbefore, was neglected because it is deeper than surrounding\nblocks. He said new developments in seismic techniques have now\nmade seismic survey possible.\n    The agreement is similar to a production-sharing contract\nPertamina signed with Occidental Petroleum Corp in February.\n    Gas produced will be divided 70-30 pct in Pertamina's\nfavour with operational costs deducted.\n    Pertamina can market at least 50 pct of Enim Oil's\nproduction share, and Enim must give up 10 pct of its interest\nin the block to an appointed Indonesian company if it finds\noil.\n    Enim must also set aside 28.57 pct of its crude for\nrefining in Indonesia if its share exceeds 150,000 barrels a\nday.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
