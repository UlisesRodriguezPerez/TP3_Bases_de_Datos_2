        "DATELINE": "    PARIS, March 11 - ",
        "BODY": "Soviet first deputy prime minister\nVsevolod Murakhovsky said at the end of a brief visit here his\ncountry wanted to boost joint business with France, but that a\nreduction of France's trade deficit with the Soviet Union\ndepended on the French.\n    Murakhovsky, who is also chairman of the State\nAgro-Industrial Committee (GOSAGROPROM), told a news conference\nhe had discussed a variety of possible deals with French\ncompanies Rhone-Poulenc, Pechiney and Imec.\n    Declining to put figures on possible contracts he said he\nhad discussed plant protection and the processing of highly\nsulphuric gas with Rhone-Poulenc, packaging technology for\nagricultural products with Pechiney, and fruit and vegetable\njuice processing with Imec.\n    An official for Pechiney said an agreement of intent on\npackaging could be signed soon, but could not give any other\ndetails. The other two companies were not immediately available\nfor comment.\n    Asked whether he foresaw a reduction this year of France's\ntrade shortfall, at 7.6 billion francs in the first 11 months\nof 1986 against 5.1 billion for the whole of 1985, Murakhovsky\ntold Reuters: \"It all depends on France.\"\n    At a meeting in Paris last January French and Soviet\nforeign trade ministers said they were committed to increased\nefforts to reduce the deficit. Estimates at the time showed a\nFrench 190 mln franc surplus for December 1986.\n    Murakhovsky said the Soviet Union was prepared to talk with\nanybody with \"interesting\" proposals offering latest technology\nand assuring \"a mutual advantage.\"\n    He said the Soviet Union had many tasks ahead of it and\nwould deal rapidly with proposals it considered interesting.\n    He encouraged companies to take advantage of new laws\nguaranteeing \"the interests of foreign partners\" in joint\nventures.\n    But he said no agreements had yet been finalised under the\nnew joint venture laws.\n    He said concrete deals had not yet been finalised as a\nresult of a one billion dollar accord signed in Moscow last\nmonth with French businessman Jean-Baptiste Doumeng.\n    He said Doumeng's Interagra company was preparing proposals\nfor further examination by the Soviet Union. Doumeng last month\nsaid the agreement was to exchange one billion dollars worth of\ngoods.\n    Murakhovsky said the agreement was one of intent, and\ndesigned primarily to renew and increase the Soviet Union's\nfood production capacity.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
