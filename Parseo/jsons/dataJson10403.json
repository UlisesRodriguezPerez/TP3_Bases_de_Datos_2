        "BODY": "A final compromise proposal on cocoa\nbuffer stock rules presented by International Cocoa\nOrganization, ICCO, council chairman Denis Bra Kanon is swiftly\ngaining acceptance by consumer and producer members, delegates\nsaid.\n    \"We are close, nearer than ever to accepting it, but we\nstill have some work to do,\" producer spokesman Mama Mohammed of\nGhana told Reuters after a producers' meeting.\n    European Community, EC, delegates said EC consumers\naccepted the package in a morning meeting and predicted \"no\nproblems\" in getting full consumer acceptance.\n    Delegates on both sides are keen to come to some agreement\ntoday, the last day of the fortnight-long council meeting, they\nsaid.\n    The compromise requires that buffer stock purchases from\nnon-ICCO member countries cannot exceed 15 pct of total buffer\nstock purchases, delegates said. The non-member cocoa issue has\nbeen among the most contentious in the rules negotiations.\n    The 15 pct figure, up five percentage points from earlier\nproposals, represents a concession to consumers, delegates\nsaid. They have demanded a larger allowance for non-member\ncocoa in the buffer stock than producers have wanted.\n    Another problem area, delegates said, was the question of\nprice differentials for different origins of cocoa bought into\nthe buffer stock, by which the buffer stock manager could\nfairly compare relative prices of different cocoas offered to\nhim.\n    The compromise narrowed the range of differentials between\nthe origins from what previous proposals had detailed -- a move\nsome delegates described as \"just fiddling.\"\n    But the adjustments may prove significant enough to appease\nsome countries that were not satisfied with the original\nproposed differentials assigned to them, delegates said.\n    The compromise also stated buffer stock purchases on any\nday would be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate or\nforward positions, delegates said.\n    If the compromise is accepted by the council, most\nconsumers and producers want buffer stock rules to take effect\nnext week, or as soon as practically possible.\n    The full council is scheduled to meet around 1500 GMT to\ndiscuss the compromise, and could agree on it then if all\nparties are satisfied, they said. Consumers are due to meet\nbefore the council.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
