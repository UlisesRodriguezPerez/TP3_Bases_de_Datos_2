        "DATELINE": "    BANGKOK, March 9 - ",
        "BODY": "Any European Community decision to\nliberalise farm trade policy would hurt Thailand's tapioca\nindustry, said Ammar Siamwalla, an agro-economist at the\nThailand Development Research Institute (TDRI).\n    He told a weekend trade seminar here that any EC move to\ncut tariff protection for EC grains would make many crops more\ncompetitive than tapioca in the European market.\n    The EC is the largest buyer of Thai tapioca, absorbing more\nthan two thirds of the 5.8 mln tonnes of pellets exported by\nThailand last year. Thailand has an EC quota of an average 5.25\nmln tonnes a year until 1990.\n    Ammar said Thailand had benefited from an EC tariff\nloophole that subjects Thai tapioca to a preferential six pct\nimport duty.\n    Ammar, head of the agricultural research group of the TDRI,\nsuggested tapioca farmers diversify to other crops.\n    He said: \"If cereal prices in Europe fall so that they are\nclose to world prices, the tapioca market there will disappear\ncompletely.\"\n    He said the issue may put Thailand in a dilemma because it\nhad recently joined other major commodity producers in calling\non the EC to cut its farm product export subsidies.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
