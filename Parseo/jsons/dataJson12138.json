        "BODY": "CTC Dealer Holdings Ltd said <Canadian\nTire Corp Ltd> controlling shareholders Alfred, David and\nMartha Billes did not extend an agreement expiring yesterday to\ntender their shares only to CTC's previously reported offer for\n49 pct of Canadian Tire common shares.\n    CTC, which already holds 17.4 pct of Canadian Tire common,\nsaid it would therefore not take up any shares tendered under\nits offer unless they totaled at least 1.1 mln or another 32.7\npct of Canadian Tire common. The Billes control 60 pct of\nCanadian Tire common. It added that it extended its offer to\nMay 11 at a fixed price of 165.36 dlrs a share.\n    CTC, a group of Canadian Tire dealers, said it expected to\nknow by May 11 if it would obtain approval to appeal a\npreviously reported Ontario court ruling upholding a regulatory\ndecision to block CTC's offer.\n    The dealers' bid was previously blocked by the Ontario\nSecurities Commission because the offer excluded holders of\nCanadian Tire class A non-voting shares, which make up about 96\npct of company equity.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
