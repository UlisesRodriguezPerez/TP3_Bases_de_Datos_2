        "TITLE": "CURRENCY INTERVENTION TIMING CRUCIAL - ANALYSTS",
        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, April 1 - ",
        "BODY": "The dollar's recent decline, despite\nmassive central bank purchases, is a forceful reminder that\nofficial intervention in the foreign exchanges can work only if\nit is well-timed to coincide with shifts in market fundamentals\nor sentiment, dealers and analysts said.\n    Central banks may succeed in slowing a trend, but, without\naccompanying policy changes, they stand little chance of\nreversing the direction of an ever-growing global market in\nwhich more than 200 billion dlrs is traded every day, the\nsources said.\n    \"Timing and psychology are the key to successful\nintervention,\" said Jim O'Neill, a financial markets economist\nwith Marine Midland Banks Inc. The importance of complementary\nchanges in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday when\na change in interest rates boosted the dollar, instantly\nachieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for a\nweek through open market intervention.\n    After Citibank raised its prime rate by a quarter-point to\n7-3/4 pct, the first change in the rate since last August, the\ndollar started to advance and reached a high in Tokyo of 147.50\nyen, up two yen from Tuesday's New York low.\n    By contrast, monetary authorities spearheaded by the Bank\nof Japan are estimated to have bought as much as 10 billion\ndlrs in the last 10 days of March but could not prevent the\ndollar from skidding through 150 yen and plumbing a 40-year low\nMonday of 144.70 yen. Some experts worry the central banks have\nlost more than just a temporary battle to prop up the dollar.\nThe market is wary of being caught wrong-footed by a central\nbank foray, but is no longer mesmerized.\n    \"They've lost their credibility. The market feels it can\ntake on the central banks and win,\" said Michael Snow, head of\ntreasury operations at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York.\n    The relative failure of recent intervention stands in sharp\ncontrast to the success that central banks scored when they\njoined forces to drive the dollar down following the September\n22, 1985, Plaza accord.\n    Then, however, central banks had an easy time of it,\nbecause the markets and the Treasuries of the major industrial\npowers were agreed that the dollar needed to head lower to\nredress massive worldwide trade imbalances.\n    Now, there is no such consensus. The market is saying that\nthe dollar must fall further because the U.S. trade deficit is\nshowing little sign of improvement, while Japan is resisting in\na bid to protect its export industries.\n    For its part, the United States is apparently content to\nlet the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little more\nthan lip service to the February Paris agreement of the Group\nof Five plus Canada to foster stability, dealers say.\n    Specifically, they said the Fed's dollar-buying\nintervention has been half-hearted, designed more as a\npolitical gesture to Japan than to strike fear into the\nmarkets. \"It's been pro-forma intervention,\" said Francoise\nSoares-Kemp, chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais.\n    Because of this discord and the market's momentum for a\nlower dollar, analysts said intervention looks doomed to fail.\n    \"It's going to take a lot more than the central banks to\nhold the dollar (at these levels),\" said Snow, who predicts\nanother 10 to 15 pct depreciation.\n    \"There have to be structural changes that occur to make the\nmarket stop selling dollars,\" added \"Buying six billion dollars\nin three weeks is not going to do it.\"\n    Late last decade during the presidency of Jimmy Carter,\nwhen the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack,\ncentral banks sometimes intervened to the tune of six billion\ndlrs in a single day but still failed to stop the dollar\nfalling to a record low of 1.70 marks, analysts said.\n    Snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely. \"I\ndon't think anybody has the stomach for it, because they saw\nthe futility of it in the seventies.\"\n    Indeed, because the market has grown in leaps and bound\nsince then, intervention on an even greater scale would\nprobably be needed to impress the market.\n    Trading volume in London, New York and Tokyo alone last\nyear averaged nearly 188 billion dlrs a day, according to a\njoint central bank study, about double the previous estimate\nmade just two years earlier by the Group of Thirty private\nresearch group.\n    There are signs that central banks, too, realize the\nfutility of swimming against the tide.\n    Bank of Japan sources told Reuters in Tokyo earlier this\nweek that they believed the limits of currency market\nintervention are perhaps being reached and that other methods\nfor bolstering the dollar, such as invoking currency swap\nagreements with other central banks, are being considered.\n    \"In this era of financial liberalization, it's almost\nimpossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan,\"\none senior official in Tokyo said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
