        "BODY": "The Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission (FERC) issued a proposed policy statement for the \nrecovery of take-or-pay costs imposed by existing natural gas\ncontracts between producers and pipelines.\n    It put out the statement, by 5-0 vote, for a 30-day comment\nperiod. It also put out an alternative policy statement by\nCommissioner Charles Stalon.\n    FERC said in a press release that \"the proposed policy\nstatement estblishes an exception to the commission's general\npolicy that take-or-pay buy-out and buy-down costs must be\nrecovered through pipeline' commodity sales rates.\"\n    FERC added that \"specifically, in cases where pipelines\nassume an equitable share of buy-out or buy-down costs, the\ncommission proposes to permit the pipelines to recover the\nremaining costs through their demand rates.\"\n    It said it wanted guidelines for buying out and reforming\nexisting contracts to help spread the impact of these\ntake-or-pay costs in a responsible, fair and equitable way.\n    Commission chairwoman Martha Hesse said \"this proposal\nrepresents the commission's sincere attempt to help the\nindustry through this difficult period of transition to a more\ncompetitive market.\"\n    Hesse said \"it is my hope that our proposed policy will\nencourage and guide the timely resolution of take-or-pay\ncontractual disputes that have impeded the industry's\ntransition to a more competitive environment.  It is vital to\nthe industry that we get this problem behind us.\"\n reuter\n\u0003"
