        "BODY": "Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng\nsaid the ruling of a GATT panel on a U.S. trade complaint\nagainst Japan, expected soon, may influence the U.S. stance in\nnegotiations with Tokyo on beef and citrus import quotas.\n    The ruling of a GATT tribunal on a U.S. demand that Japan\nend quotas on 12 categories of food items is expected by the\nend of the year. Lyng said he is optimistic the ruling will\nfavor the U.S.\n    \"These are quota items, and the principles that apply to\nthem, it seems to me, will have some bearing on the question of\nwhether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus,\" Lyng\ntold Reuters in an interview.\n    He repeated the U.S. demand that Japan lift the quotas on\nbeef and citrus after March 31, next year.\n    The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the United\nStates has challenged include items such as tomato paste, some\ncheeses and specialty fruit juices.\n    U.S. officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas would\nbe issued earlier this year but the GATT panel decision has\nbeen delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman.\n    The U.S. has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrus\nquotas, which Tokyo says must remain in place to protect\nJapanese farmers.\n    \"We will not negotiate new quotas or accept new quotas (on\nbeef and citrus). If they impose them we would consider that an\nillegal action in the GATT, Lyng said.\n    He declined to say what action the U.S. would take next\nApril if Japan continues to resist U.S. demands.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003"
