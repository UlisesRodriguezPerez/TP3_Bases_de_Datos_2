        "TITLE": "U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY SEES HIGHER OIL PRICES",
        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, June 2 - ",
        "BODY": "Energy Secretary Donald Hodel said he\nexpects oil prices to rise significantly by the year 2000,\nprobably to around 33 dlrs a barrel in current dollars.\n    \"I do anticipate a significant increase (by 2000).\nThirty-three dlrs a barrel is not unreasonable,\" Hodel told the\nSenate Energy Committee.\n    Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through\nthe shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells\nbecause of low prices was probably permanent. He said he was\nalso concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration.\n    Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section\n1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He said\ngeologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery\nof oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
