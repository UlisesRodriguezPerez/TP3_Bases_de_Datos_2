        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, March 19 - ",
        "BODY": "Panama Canal toll charges will not rise\nin the year to end-September 1988, despite last October's\nlandslide which dumped 0.5 mln cubic yards of debris into the\nwaterway, Canal Commission Administrator Dennis McAuliffe said.\n    He told a press conference that in confirming the\nCommission's earlier announcement of unchanged tolls for 1988,\nhe was not necessarily implying there would be a rise in 1989.\n    The canal would probably make a five to six mln dlr loss in\nthe current financial year but this could be carried over and\nmet from next year's revenues.\n    This year's deficit resulted from the landslide which cost\nthe canal about 15 mln dlrs, McAuliffe said. This included\neight to nine mln dlrs in immediate costs with the rest being\nspent on earth-moving operations to prevent any further\nlandslides.\n    He said the landslide was not caused by deforestation and\nhe described as grossly exaggerated reports that there was any\nthreat to the canal's water supply in the foreseeable future.\n    Studies concerning the possibility of widening the Gaillard\ncut would not be affected by the landslide, he said, adding\nthat he expected the canal board to determine whether and when\nthe canal needed widening by January 1988 at the latest.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
