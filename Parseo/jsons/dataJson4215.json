        "DATELINE": "    STRASBOURG, March 12 - ",
        "BODY": "The EC Commission said it was\nadopting an \"open attitude\" about whether a system of production\nquotas should remain for the indefinite future on heavy steel\nproducts which account for about 45 pct of all EC steel goods.\n    In a statement, the Commission reiterated its view that the\nindustry needs to lose between 25 and 30 mln tonnes of capacity\nby 1990. It had previously said the quota system, started in\n1980, should be wound up completely by the end of next year.\n    The industry has argued for the maintenance of existing\nquotas, which cover almost 70 pct of all output, saying almost\nall steelmakers are losing money due to the depressed market.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
