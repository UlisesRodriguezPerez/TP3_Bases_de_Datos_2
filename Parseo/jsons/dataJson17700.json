        "TITLE": "COMPUTER ASSOC. <CA> BOLSTERS HAND AGAINST IBM",

        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, June 1 - ",
        "BODY": "Computer Associates International Inc's\n800 mln dlr merger with Uccel Corp <UCE> will eliminate its\nstrongest rival, but the company still faces stiff competition\nfrom International Business Machines Corp <IBM>, Wall Street\nanalysts said.\n     \"IBM is still the ruling force in mainframe systems\nsoftware,\" said Scott Smith, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin\nand Jenrette.\n    \"But the combination of the two companies will clearly\npresent a much stronger front,\" he said.\n    Besides IBM, \"Computer Associates will be far and away the\nmost powerful company in the field,\" added E.F. Hutton analyst\nTerence Quinn.\n    That field is a segment of the market known as system\nutilities, or software packages that boost the productivity of\na company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed,\npower and efficiency of large mainframe computers.\n    The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines the\ntwo biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM.\nAnalysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms that\nwill find the competition much harder than in the past.\n    For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps a\nsix-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City,\nN.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry.\n    When the deal is completed sometime in August, the\ncompany's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past \nMicrosoft Corp <MFST> as the world's largest independent\nsoftware vendor.\n    Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wang\ntook the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought\n15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3\nmln dlrs for the year ended March 31.\n    Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computer\nbusinesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe\ncomputer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp.\n    Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after the\nmerger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.\n    On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of six\ncompanies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.\n    For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, on\nsales of 141.5 mln dlrs.\n    The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largely\nbecause the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,\nDallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the\ndark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or\n56 cts a share.\n   At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different\nbusinesses, only three of which were involved in computer\nsoftware. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and a\nmajor Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from his\njob as chairman of General Electric Co's <GE> computer services\nunit.\n    Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at a\nnews conference that the merger would give computer users a\nsingle source for a wide range of software products.\n    In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates also\nsell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroads\nin the applications software market, where analysts said it has\nbeen successful with accounting and banking systems.\n    Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support and\nenhance both companies' product lines, but noted that the\ncompany will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He said\nabout 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.\n    Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of\ncurrent Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. But\nthey joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute\nComputer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.\n    Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of\ncompleting acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,\nhe said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05\ndlrs a share.\n    Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations\nof the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing\nand research and development.\n    Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.\nBased on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50\ndlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly\n33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.\n    Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said most\nsoftware companies are currently valued at about 20 times\nper-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth the\npremium because of its earnings potential and customer base.\n\n    Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25\npct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currently\nowns 58 pct of Uccel.\n    The executive said the merger would not alter his target of\nmaintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct.\n    In addition, he said he expects no problems in having the\ndeal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice\nDepartment.\n    Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after the\nmerger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003"
