        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, June 29 - ",
        "BODY": "The Treasury Department said it\nnotified the Netherlands that it was terminating the 1948\nincome tax treaty as it applies to the Netherlands Antilles and\nAruba.\n    The termination is effective January 1, 1988, the Treasury\nsaid in a two-sentence announcement.\n    The Treasury decided to end the treaty after negotiations\nbetween the United States and the Netherlands over the past\neight years had failed to reach an accord, a Treasury spokesman\nsaid.\n    The decision means the sale by U.S. parent companies of\nEurobonds through Netherlands Antilles subsidiaries will no\nlonger be free of the 30 pct U.S. withholding tax, the\nspokesman said.\n    Terminating the tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles \nmay cause bond issuers to call in the bonds early. Most have\nmaturities of 10 years or less and were issued before 1984, the\nspokesman said.\n    He said the Treasury did not expect the action to have an\nadverse effect on U.S. issuers of the bonds because the general\ndecline in interest rates means they will be able to refinance\nat lower interest rates.\n    However, the holders of the bonds presumably will be faced\nwith lower yields.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
