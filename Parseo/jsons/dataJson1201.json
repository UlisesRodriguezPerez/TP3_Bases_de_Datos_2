        "TITLE": "ROSTENKOWSKI OPPOSES PROTECTIONIST TRADE BILL",
        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 3 - ",
        "BODY": "House Ways and Means Committee\nChairman Dan Rostenkowski said Congress must avoid a temptation\nto pass a protectionist trade bill this year.\n    In remarks prepared for delivery before the National Press\nClub, Rostenkowski, D-Ill., predicted major trade legislation\nwill be sent to President Reagan by the end of this year.\n    But he warned that his \"conciliatory message\" on the trade\nbill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warn\nother countries their access to the American market would be\ncurtailed unless they opened their markets to U.S. goods.\n    \"Complaints about (foreign trade) restraints are not a\nsmoke screen for protectionism, they a plea for fairness,\"\nRostenkowski said.\n    \"It is only reasonable to ask the nations that have denied\nus access to open up in return for continued freedom in the\nAmerican market,\" he added.\n    However, he said there would likely be changes in the\nmarket access proposal from the plan which cleared the House\nlast year. That plan would have set a specific time table for\nforeign countries to ease import restraints or they would face\na 25 pct cut in exports to the United States.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
