        "TITLE": "DOME PETE<DMP> SAID TO BE PRESSED TO SELL ENCOR",

        "BODY": "Dome Petroleum Ltd is under pressure\nfrom one of its largest creditors, <Canadian Imperial Bank of\nCommerce>, to sell its 42 pct stake in <Encor Energy Corp Ltd>,\nenergy industry analysts said.\n    Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for\npart of its debt to Commerce Bank, estimated last year at 947\nmln Canadian dlrs, and the bank wants Dome to sell the stock to\npay down debt, analysts said.\n    \"The Commerce has been slowly but surely moving Encor in the\ndirection that might make it a saleable asset,\" said one analyst\nwho asked not to be named.\n    Dome earlier said it was not considering selling Encor\nEnergy, but reaffirmed the company's 23.3 pct interest in\nCanadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd <DM> is up for sale \"at\nthe right price.\"\n    Dome, now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 6.10\nbillion dlrs in debt, sees Encor as a strategic investment that\nit does not intend to sell, spokesman David Annesley said. The\nEncor shares do not pay dividends.\n    A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when asked\nwhether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake.\n    At current market prices, Dome's stake in Encor would be\nvalued at about 308 mln dlrs, while its 20.9 mln Dome Mines\nshares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs.\n    Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may also\nprompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in the\nCanadian oil and gas producer, analysts said.\n    \"Encor's stock price has improved quite substantially in\nrecent weeks with a runup in crude prices,\" Peters and Co Ltd\noil analyst Wilf Gobert commented.\n    \"The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see it\nsold at these levels because they can get more for it now than\nthey have been able to in recent years,\" he added.\n    Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at\n7-1/8, near its 52-week high of 7-1/2 and up from around six\ndlrs in early February.\n    The company also recently set up its own operating\nmanagement, which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum,\nMaison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented.\n    Dome and Encor \"are actually going to get farther apart. So\n(the sale) does make a lot of sense,\" Mote said.\n    However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divest\nEncor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale\nproceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome's debt to\nCommerce Bank.\n    \"I think they'll probably try to hang onto Encor as long as\nthey can,\" said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber.\n    Some of Dome's group of 56 major creditors might move to\nblock such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets.\n    \"Other creditors generally all want to make sure that\nsomething they might be able to get a piece of is not being\nsold out from under them,\" said analyst Gobert.\n    Another stumbling block would be Encor's 225 mln dlr joint\nliability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by Arctic\nPetroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration.\n    Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the\npossible sale of Dome Petroleum's interest in Dome Mines.\n    Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum's\ndebt and has a \"right of consent\" to the sale of Dome Petroleum's\nholding.\n    Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shares\nwould seek some type of relief on the company's debt\nobligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said.\n    Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at what\nprice the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares,\nbut said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share \"are very\nattractive.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
