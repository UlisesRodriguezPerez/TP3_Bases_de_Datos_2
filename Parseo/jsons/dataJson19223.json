        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, June 19 - ",
        "BODY": "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit upheld a lower court decision dismissing a suit\nby Apex Oil Co against the New York Mercantile Exchange and\nseveral oil companies.\n    The Court, however, ruled that Apex Oil could pursue\nanititrust and commodities market manipulation allegations\nagainst Belcher Oil Co, a unit of Coastal Corp <CGP>.\n    Apex Oil, primarily a trading company, charged that several\ncompanies, including Belcher, and NYMEX conspired to force it\nto deliver heating oil it had sold on the mercantile exchange,\nknowing Apex could not make full delivery.\n   \n    The NYMEX ordered Apex to deliver four mln barrels of\nheating oil sold via a February 1982 heating oil contract. Apex\neventually fulfilled this obligation but claimed damages.\n    Richard Wiener, attorney for Apex at Cadwalader Wickersham\nand Taft, said the company has not yet decided whether to\npursue its case against Belcher Oil.\n    The NYMEX, meanwhile, has a counterclaim pending against\nApex Oil, seeking an unspecified amount of attorney's fees and\n15 mln dlrs in punitive damages, according to a NYMEX\nspokeswoman.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
