        "BODY": "Morgan Crucible Co Plc <MGCR.L> said the\nprospects for 1987 were encouraging, with orders and sales\nsignificantly up on last year in all divisions.\n    It said there were good opportunities for growth in both\nexisting and recently acquired businesses as well as for growth\nby acquisition in related areas.\n    It earlier announced a 6.1 mln stg rise in pre-tax profit\nto 24.8 mln stg for the year to December 28. Turnover rose to\n242.1 mln from 211.5 mln.\n    Most of its companies performed well despite a slowdown in\nthe U.S., U.K. And Australian economies in the first half.\n    Currency fluctuations reduced pretax profit by around one\nmln stg, it noted.\n    Morgan said although profits in the electronics sector\nimproved to 1.0 mln stg from 100,000 stg previously, results\nwere nonetheless disappointing.\n    Sales were lower than expected, due mainly to delayed\ndefence orders and cancellations. However, it said it had taken\nthe necessary remedial action, obtained new business and was\nnow proceeding with the delivery of major delayed orders.\n    Morgan shares firmed two pence to 318p at 0905 GMT from\n316p at Friday's close.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
