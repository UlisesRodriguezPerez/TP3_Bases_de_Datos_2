        "BODY": "The U.S. National Association of\nWheat Growers (NAWG) urged the Reagan administration offer the\nSoviet Union wheat under the export enhancement program (eep).\n    In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, NAWG\nstated its \"strong support\" for an eep offer to Moscow.\n    \"We believe that a solid case continues to exist for Soviet\nEEP eligibility, and the recently announced and reported Soviet\npurchases of U.S. corn indicate a Soviet willingness to\npurchase U.S. grain if it is competitively priced,\" NAWG said.\n    \"Consequently, we believe it is important to renew the U.S.\neep offer and do all that is reasonably possible to ensure\nmutual adherence to the terms of the U.S.-Soviet grain\nagreement,\" the letter said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
