        "BODY": "Brazil's trade surplus in March\ntotalled 136 mln dlrs, down from 1.13 billion dlrs in the same\nmonth last year, the official Banco do Brasil announced.\n    In a news conference, the director of the bank's Foreign\nTrade Department (Cacex), Roberto Fendt, attributed March's \nweak performance to labour strikes.\n    March exports totalled 1.43 billion dlrs, against 1.53\nbillion dlrs in February, and 2.16 billion dlrs in March 1986.\n    March imports amounted to 1.29 billion dlrs compared to\n1.27 billion dlrs in February and 1.02 billion dlrs in March\n1986.\n    Fendt said coffee earnings were up to 220 mln dlrs in March\nfrom 110 mln dlrs in February, while oil derivatives were down\nto 54 mln dlrs from 58 mln dlrs in February.\n    He said that although the March results were considerably\nlower than the same month last year, the government's target of\nan eight billion dlr surplus for 1987 should be achieved. The\nJanuary-March trade surplus totalled 526 mln dlrs, below the\nsame period last year, which reached 2.46 billion dlrs.\n    Asked to explain the reason for his optimism, Fendt said\nthe trade surplus should reach one billion dlrs in each of the\nlast six months of the year.\n    Even though results in the exports of steel, shoes and\nfrozen concentrated orange juice were weaker compared to\nFebruary, Fendt said this was not an indication that the United\nStates was retaliating on account of its dispute with Brazil in\nthe issue of informatics.\n    For the next three months, Fendt estimated a monthly trade\nsurplus of 400 mln dlrs, for an overall surplus of 1.2 billion\ndlrs in the April-May-June period.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
