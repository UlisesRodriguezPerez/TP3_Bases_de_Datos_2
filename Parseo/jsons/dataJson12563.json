        "BODY": "U.S. Trade Representative Clayton\nYeutter stressed the importance of trade negotiations to open\nforeign markets rather than trade restrictions in a statement\nto the Senate Finance Committee.\n    \"In the long term we cannot repeatedly bludgeon other\nnations into opening their markets with threats of U.S.\nrestrictions. Rather, we must be able to negotiate credibly for\nglobal liberalization,\" Yeutter said.\n    Yeutter did not mention the recent U.S. trade sanctions\nagainst Japanese semiconductors in his testimony on the pending\ntrade bill.\n    Yeutter said the trade bill should increase U.S.\ncompetitiveness, aid U.S. trade negotiating leverage, and avoid\nprovoking foreign retaliation.\n    He urged Congress to reject provisions that would mandate\nU.S. retaliation against foreign unfair trade practices.\n    Yeutter emphasized the importance of the new multilateral\ntrade negotiating round and called on Congress to quickly\napprove an extension of U.S. negotiating authority.\n    \"We want to open foreign markets and establish and enforce\nrules of international competition, not foster dependence on\nprotection and subsidies,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
