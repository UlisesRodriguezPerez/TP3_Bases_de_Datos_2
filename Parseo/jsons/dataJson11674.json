        "BODY": "Coleman Co said it expects a\nfirst-quarter charge against earnings of 1.6 mln dlrs, or 23\ncts a share, as a result of its voluntary program to replace\ncondensing heat exchangers in its early Model 90 series\nhigh-efficiency residential gas furnaces.\n    The company said extensive testing indicates a problem\nfound in the furnaces is not safety related. Coleman said it\nnoted an increasing number of heat exchangers in certain\nfurnaces made from March 1984 through December 1985 were\nreturned because of corrosion.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
