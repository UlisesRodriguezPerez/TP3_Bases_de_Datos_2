        "BODY": "Fiji today welcomed the ending of a trade\nban imposed by Australian labor unions as supporters of the\ncountry's ousted prime minister Timoci Bavadra renewed pressure\nfor his reinstatement with strikes and shop closures.\n    The government welcomed a decision by the Australian\nWaterside Workers' Federation to lift its ban on shipments to\nFiji, imposed in support of Bavadra, whose newly-elected\ngovernment was overthrown in a military coup on May 14.\n    The ban had threatened food shortages of imported wheat,\nfresh vegetables and medicines. A direct result of the union\ndecision would be the immediate shipment of 9,000 tons of rice\nand wheat from an Australian port, the government said.\n    Shops in Nadi and Lautoka, center of the country's sugar\nindustry, closed again today in support of Bavadra.\n    In Nadi two bomb threats forced evacuation of the\nAustralian Westpac bank, but police said they turned out to be\na hoax. Bavadra has launched a campaign of civil disobedience\nto press for his reinstatement.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
