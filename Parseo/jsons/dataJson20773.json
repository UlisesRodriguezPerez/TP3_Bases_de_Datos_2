        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - ",
        "BODY": "Dart Group Corp <DARTA.O> affiliate\nMadison Partners said that given current market conditions it\nhas dropped its takeover bid for Dayton Hudson Corp.\n    The company said it sold 1.4 mln of its 4.6 mln shares of\nDayton Hudson stock.\n    It said it intends to sell the rest of its Dayton Hudson\nshares. At current market levels, it would suffer a 70 mln dlr\naftertax loss on its holding, a spokesman said.\n    Dart said it will not solicit authorization to call a\nmeeting of Dayton Hudson shareholders.\n    Dart had offered to buy Dayton Hudson for 68 dlrs per\nshare, valuing the Minneapolis based retailer at 6.6 billion\ndlrs. That offer was rejected by the company.\n    Following the selloff in takeover stocks last week, and the\nmarket's decline this week, Dayton Hudson stock closed at\n27-1/2 today, off 2-1/2.\n    Dart's holdings amounted to just under five pct of Dayton\nHudson.\n    A Dart spokesman said the 1.4 mln shares were sold in the\nmarket today.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
