        "BODY": "Production in the manufactured goods\nindustry has been falling since mid-1986 and will decline by\nbetween one and two pct this year after a 2.5 pct increase in\n1986, the Ifo economic institute said.\n    An Ifo report said recessionary influences were affecting\nthe engineering industry particularly. It saw a decline of two\nto three pct in this sector after a 5.2 pct rise in 1986.\n    Orders, especially from abroad, were also falling sharply\nfor capital goods in the electronics sector, it added.\n    Ifo also predicted stagnation in the automobile industry in\n1987 after a particularly successful 1986 when production rose\n5.1 pct.\n    Chemical industry production, which fell by 0.9 pct last\nyear, was likely to stagnate or decline by one pct in 1987.\nThis sector suffered from slack demand from abroad and from low\ndomestic consumption.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
