        "BODY": "No formal talks have been scheduled yet\namong companies involved in a controversial proposal to merge\ntwo groups seeking to enter Japan's international\ntelecommunications sector, an official from one group said.\n    \"Nothing has been firmed up yet,\" said an official at\n<International Digital Communications Planning Inc> (IDC), one\nof the groups set up last year to study competing against\n<Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd>, which monopolises the sector.\n    Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWL.L>, which holds a 20\npct share in IDC, has opposed plans to merge with rival group,\n<International Telecom Japan Inc>.\n    Under the plan, backed by the Post and Telecommunications\nMinistry, Cable and Wireless and U.S.-based <Pacific Telesis\nInternational Inc> would become core companies in the merged\nfirm, with shares equal to those of the six major Japanese core\ncompanies and seats on the board of directors.\n    Britain, angry over what it feels are moves to restrict\nCable and Wireless' role in the sector, views the issue as a\ntest case. The IDC official declined to specify what was\nholding up the talks.\n    A spokesman for C. Itoh and Co Ltd <CITT.T>, which holds 20\npct of IDC, said a meeting may be held later this week.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
