        "TITLE": "JAPAN CUTS CHIP SUPPLY, MAY PRODUCE SHORTAGE",
        "AUTHOR": "    By Sam Fromartz, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, April 7 - ",
        "BODY": "Japan is attempting to cut back\nsemiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in U.S.\ntariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April\n17, industry analysts said.\n    The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and a\npossible shortage of the key computer components in the next\nfew weeks, the analysts said.\n    \"Prices have gone up for memory components, the mainstay of\nthe Japanese semiconductor industry,\" analyst Drew Peck of\nDonaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said.\n    But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far,\nand some questioned whether Japan would be successful in\nforcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run.\n    Others, however, were more optimistic, saying evidence was\nalready in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and halted\nsales to the grey market, the third country brokers that sell\nchips at below production costs.\n    \"We've seen the grey market begin to dry up for D-RAMS, and\nit has virtually dried up for EPROMS,\" said Merrill Lynch\nanalyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used in\ncomputers.\n    \"Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are\nstretching,\" Kurlack added.\n    Industry analysts said Japan's Ministry of International\nTrade and Industry, or MITI, had requested the cut backs in\nproduction to meet the terms of last year's semiconductor\naccord with the U.S.\n    The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on\nJapanese electronic goods, alleging that Japan had failed to\nlive up to the accord and continued to dump the computer\ncomponents in the U.S. market.\n    But some analysts said Japan's attempt to mollify the U.S.\nwas a double edged sword, and might be read at a subtle form of\ntrade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the U.S.\n    As production in Japan is cut, these analysts argue, prices\nwill rise in the U.S. and few American semiconductor\nmanufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long\nago exited the market for memory chips. U.S. computer makers\nthat use the chips in their machines will then be pressured.\n    \"The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade\npressures from Washington, but at the same time they're\ndemonstating their muscle,\" analyst Peck said.\n    The cut backs in Japanese production are expected to\nbenefit U.S. chip makers.\n    \"I think this could be a very important factor for U.S.\nsemiconductor manufacturers,\" industry analyst Elliot Levine of\nLadenburg Thalmann Co said.\n    But analyst Peck said, \"it will take a few weeks to see\nwhether Japan has genuinely cut production.\"\n    He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITI's\nrequest unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and\nproduction cut backs would lead to significant write-offs in\nplant and equipment.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003"
