        "BODY": "The collapse of International Coffee\nOrganization, ICO, talks on export quotas yesterday removes the\nimmediate need to reinstate U.S. legislation allowing the\ncustoms service to monitor coffee imports, analysts here said.\n    The Reagan administration proposed in trade legislation\noffered Congress last month that authority to monitor coffee\nimports be resumed. That authority lapsed in September 1986. A\nbill also was introduced by Rep. Frank Guarini (D-N.J.).\n    However, the failure of the ICO talks in London to reach\nagreement on export quotas means the U.S. legislation is not\nimmediately needed, one analyst said. Earlier supporters of the\ncoffee bill hoped it could be passed by Congress quickly.\n    \"You're going to have a hard time convincing Congress (now)\nthis is an urgent issue,\" the coffee analyst said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
