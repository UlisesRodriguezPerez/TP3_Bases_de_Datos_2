        "BODY": "National Computer Systems Inc\nexpects fiscal year earnings to improve by about 20 pct, the\ncompany told analysts, although it said the April 30 first\nquarter should show \"down earnings and virtually flat\nrevenues.\"\n    Chairman Charles Oswald said National Computer has taken\nsteps to improve margins. He said revenues are expected to\nincrease modestly because of the company's decision to downsize\nits leasing business, nonrecurring revenueslast year from a\none-time Texas teacher assessment project and the impact of the\ndiscontinuance of products last year.\n    Oswald said National Computer's first quarter results will\nbe down as a result of a major financial systems sales last\nyear, a higher effective tax rate and the increased number of\nshares outstanding.\n    The company said the next three consecutive quarters should\ndemonstrate \"excellent earnings growth.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
