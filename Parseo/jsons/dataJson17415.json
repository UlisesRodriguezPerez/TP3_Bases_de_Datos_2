        "TITLE": "OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING MOVING INTO DEEPER WATERS",
        "DATELINE": "     HOUSTON, April 29 - ",
        "BODY": "Offshore drilling for oil and gas will\nbe moving into deeper and deeper waters, according to Ronald L.\nGeer, a consultant with Shell Oil Co. and president of the\nMarine Technology Society.\n     Geer told a press conference at the Offshore Technology\nConference that the technology existed to drill exploratory\nwells in up to 10,000 feet of water.\n     But he added that as the industry moves more and more to\nfloating systems as opposed to fixed bottom supported\nstructures, the financial risks involved were greater.\n     He said such projects involved six to nine year time\nframes, and there was a \"reluctance for people to stick their\nnecks too far out.\"\n     Shell holds the world record for the deepest exploratory\nwell, at 6,900 feet, in the Wilmington Canyon in the Atlantic\noffshore New Jersey in 1984.\n     The company is currently drilling a 6,700 foot well in the\nAtwater Valley in the Gulf of Mexico offshore Louisiana.\n     Meanwhile, Brazil's Petrobras set a world record for\nunderwater production when they brought a well in 1,350 feet of\nwater offshore Rio de Janeiro state into production in January.\n     Geer said the industry was particularly interested in the\nGreen Canyon field offshore Louisiana where a number of\ncompanies, including Shell, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell <RD>,\nDupont Co's <DD> Conoco Inc, USX Corp's <X> Marathon Oil Co,\nStandard Oil Co <SRD> and <Placid Oil Co>, are working, many of\nthem testing new deep-water technologies.\n     Of particular interest is the controversial Penrod-72\nsystem being operated by the Dallas-based Hunt brothers who\nlast year placed Placid Oil under bankruptcy court protection\nin order to avoid foreclosures on its valuable oil properties.\n     They have been seeking the right to use assets to drill\noil wells in the Green Canyon through Penrod, arguing that\ncontinued development of the project is essential to their\nability to get out of their financial crisis.\n     Earlier this month, the Hunts were granted permission by a\nbankruptcy court to pursue the Green Canyon project.\n     The Penrod system involves a controversial floating\nproduction platform with well heads sitting 1,350 feet down on\nthe ocean floor. Some 24 wells will be attached to the\nwellhead, with one satellite well sitting in a record 1,700\nfeet of water.\n     Geer said he could not comment on the Penrod project,\nother than to note that it involves so many new technologies,\nit might have a problem fitting all the pieces together within\na specific time frame.\n     He also said he believed the potential production from the\nproject could be in line with what the Hunt Brothers have\nprojected\n.\n     The Hunts' creditor banks have contended the Hunts have\nexaggerated the potential of the project.\n     \"They're in the ballpark,\" he said, of the numbers, adding\nthat he did not have enough information to comment further.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
