        "BODY": "Treasury Secretary James Baker said\nthat changes in exchange rates have generally been orderly and\nhave improved the prospects for a reduction in external\nimbalances to more sustainable levels.\n    In remarks before the IMF's policy-making Interim\nCommittee, Baker reiterated a Group of Seven statement last\nnight that the substantial exchange rate changes since the\nPlaza agreement 18 months ago have \"now brought currencies\nwithin ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals.\"\n    Baker said, \"These exchange rate shifts have generally been\norderly, and have improved prospects for the reduction of\nexternal imbalances to more sustainable levels.\"\n    As they are today, the trade and current account imbalances\n\"simply are not sustainable,\" Baker told the ministers.\n    He said that the Reagan administration was resisting \"strong\ndomestic pressure\" for trade protection and was working closely\nwith the U.S. Congress in crafting a trade bill.\n    \"While we cannot yet be sure of the outcome, we are doing\nwhat we can to ensure that the bill is not protectionist,\" he\nsaid.\n    Baker also urged the International Monetary Fund's\nexecutive board to review possible modifications to the Fund's\ncompensatory financing facility before the annual meeting this\nfall.\n    \"We should pay particular attention to the lack of\ncontinuing conditionality associated with the use of the CFF\nand to whether shortfalls in export earnings are indeed\ntemporary,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
