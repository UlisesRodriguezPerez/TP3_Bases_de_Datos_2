        "BODY": "The use of generic in-kind commodity\ncertificates has helped ease storage problems and is a\nnecessary part of export promotion programs, a senior executive\nfor the world's largest grain company said.\n    Testifying before the House Agriculture subcommittee on\nwheat, soybeans and feedgrains, Robbin Johnson, vice president\nof Cargill, Inc., disputed claims that U.S. grain companies\nhave made huge profits from certificate trading.\n    \"The certs program is not in any way a windfall to the\ntrade,\" he said. Johnson said that Cargill has been dealing\nwith a two pct spread in certificate transactions, and that\nthis is within the normal grain marketing levels.\n    Johnson recognized current concern over the cost of\ncertificates as compared to cash, but said that critics need to\nlook more closely at the savings caused by certs, noting for\nexample that widespread use of certs in the PIK and Roll\nmarketing technique last summer helped ease storage costs.\n    Certificates are also an important part of any export\npromotion program, he said.\n    \"The more you look at ways to expand export markets, the\nmore you have to look at ways to expand certs to put more grain\ninto the market to meet demand,\" he said.\n    Subcommittee chairman Dan Glickman (D-Kans.) said his\ncommittee would be looking at the certificate program later\nthis year and studying the General Accounting Office report on\ncertificate costs.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
