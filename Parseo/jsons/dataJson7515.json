        "BODY": "Whether the European Community's\nCouncil of Ministers will approve a proposed tax on vegetable\noils that has sparked threats of U.S. retaliation is uncertain,\nan EC official said.\n    \"It is very far from certain that it will go through,\" Sir\nRoy Denman, Head of the EC Delegation in Washington, told\nreporters before he addressed the Foreign Trade Association.\n    Denman noted Britain remains opposed to the plan and West\nGermany has opposed it in the past.\n    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has threatened\nretaliation if the tax is approved, as it would limit U.S.\nsoybean exports to the EC. Council action is expected soon.\n    Denman said while the EC is willing to negotiate about\nagriculture in a new round of trade talks, it is unwilling to\nsingle out export subsidies on a negotiating agenda or put\nagricultural policy on a special fast track.\n    \"The key to a solution in this area seems to me not in the\nframing of the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)\nwording...but in tackling government subsidies to farmers on\nboth sides of the Atlantic,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
