        "BODY": "Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone sounded\na conciliatory note in Japan's increasingly bitter row with the\nUnited States over trade in computer microchips.\n    \"Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by\nexplaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that\nneed to be corrected,\" he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as\nsaying.\n    While expressing regret over America's decision to impose\ntariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone said\nTokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington\nto help settle the dispute.\n    Government officials said Japan would make a formal request\nnext week for emergency talks and that the two sides would\nprobably meet the week after, just days before the April 17\ndeadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect.\n    Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan\ninvestigation of American claims that Japanese companies are\ndumping cut-price chips in Asian markets.\n    On Friday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300\nmln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic\ngoods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to\nlive up to their bilateral chip pact.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
