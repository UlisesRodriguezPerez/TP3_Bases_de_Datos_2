        "BODY": "The Zambian government has no immediate\nplans to follow last week's increase in the producer price of\nmaize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an\nofficial of the ruling party said.\n    Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for\nrefined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in\nwhich at least 15 people died.\n    That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later\nrevoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund\n(IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill.\n    However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67\ndlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price\nincrease, the government will have to spend more on subsidies,\na practice discouraged by the IMF.\n    \"There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of\nmeal. It (the government) would have to choose between the\ndemands of the IMF and those of the people,\" a Ministry of\nAgriculture economist said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
