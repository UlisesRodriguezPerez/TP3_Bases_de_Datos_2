        "BODY": "Sterling made a sharp recovery when U.K.\nChancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson described remarks he\nmade yesterday on targets for the pound as \"insignificant,\"\nrallying back up almost exactly to the levels it had fetched\nbefore Lawson spoke yesterday, dealers and analysts said.\n    They said sterling would likely leave the limelight once\nagain to trade quietly around current levels, as the markets\nset their sights on the dollar, yen and mark again ahead of key\ninternational monetary talks in Washington next week.\n    Sterling ended its European day at 1.6020/30 dlrs,\nvirtually unchanged from yesterday's last 1.6040/50 dlrs,\nfetched before Lawson's first comment. But it was well up on\nlevels just above 1.59 dlrs which it had held until the second\ncomment came.\n    Against the mark, sterling recovered to close at\n2.9190/9240 marks after today's opening 2.9040/90 and last\nnight's 2.9210/45.\n    \"On balance, it is as if nothing happened ... We are back to\nwhere we were before,\" Mark Brett, economist at securities house\nBarclays de Zoete Wedd said.\n    \"This whole story is like a storm in a teacup,\" a dealer with\na U.K. Bank commented.\n    The pound's recovery was triggered when Lawson criticised\nmedia coverage of comments he made yesterday, when he told a\nconference he wanted sterling to stay roughly where it was.\n    In this context, Lawson was reported to have specified\nrates of around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs to the pound in\nremarks which markets were quick to interpret as a signal to\nsell sterling.\n    Lawson said today he had merely stated yesterday's\napproximate value of the pound.\n    \"The wrong end of the stick was picked up,\" he told\nreporters, adding his comments did in no way signal a change in\nBritish exchange rate policies.\n    Dealers and analysts said the reactions to both statements\nwere clear evidence that the market, frustrated by the relative\ncurrency stability after the February 22 Paris agreement, was\ndesperate to reactivate trading and would react to any clues\noffered about the contents of the currency accord.\n    In Paris, finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada\nare widely believed to have agreed exchange rate targets,\nalthough no participant has specified these in an apparent bid\nto foster stability by keeping markets guessing.\n    \"The markets are absolutely desperate to get clues on Group\nof Six (countries that are part to the Paris agreement) targets\n... The number of rumours flying around is bigger than ever\nbefore,\" said Barclays de Zoete Wedd's Brett.\n    Analysts said neither yesterday's remarks nor today's had\nchanged their impression that after Paris, sterling was\ntargeted to trade in broad ranges against major currencies.\n     All polled analysts said if anything, the 2.90 marks level\nmentioned by Lawson was probably the centre of a wide\n20-pfennig range which sterling would easily hold, helped by\ngood economic indicators and relatively high interest rates.\n    \"It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an\nelection ... I don't believe Lawson is mad enough to tie\nhimself to a fixed rate,\" Brett said. He expected sterling to\nfirm over the next few weeks, to around 2.95 marks and 1.63\ndlrs, as overseas investors reappraised high-yielding\ninvestments here.\n    Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan\nSecurities, said he was not surprised to see Lawson qualify his\nsterling target comments so quickly.\n    \"His remarks gave markets a target to aim at,\" he said,\nadding, \"He (Lawson) talked himself into a bit of a corner on\nthis ... It made him a hostage to fortune.\"\n    Marshall and other analysts dismissed a theory, that by\nquoting target rates Lawson had attempted to put pressure on\nprime Minister Margaret Thatcher to agree to British membership\nof the European Monetary System (EMS), as implausible.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
