        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - ",
        "BODY": "A study on grain certificates due out\nshortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show\nthat certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than\ncash outlays, administration and industry sources said.\n    Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture\nDepartment and the Office of Management and Budget suggests\nthat certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO official\ntold Reuters.\n    GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific\nrequest of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of the\nsenate agriculture committee.\n    The report, which will focus on the cost of certificates\ncompared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March.\n    The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends on\nthe program's impact on the USDA loan program.\n    If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan\nentries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of\nthe program would go up. However, if it is determined that\ncertificates have caused the government grain stockpile to\ndecrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less.\n    GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates\nprogram should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said.\n    But a negative report on certificates \"will fuel the fire\nagainst certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase\nin the certificate program,\" an agricultural consultant said.\n    The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program,\nwhile USDA remains firmly committed to it.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
