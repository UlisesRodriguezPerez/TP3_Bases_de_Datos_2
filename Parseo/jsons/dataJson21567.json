        "BODY": "Uganda plans to export roasted coffee to\nEurope by the end of 1988, a prominent local businessman said.\n    A.R. Sendi said on Sunday that Uganda's Ministry of\nIndustry supports his plan to build a factory to roast, grind\nand pack local coffee for export. Construction will start in\nDecember and the factory should be ready by next October.\n    He said the Marketing Ministry has authorised the Coffee\nMarketing Board to supply his company <Unipack> with 24,000\ntonnes of beans a year for processing and export. Sendi also\ntold reporters he had negotiated a 69.7 mln French franc loan\nfrom the Banque Industrielle d'Afrique Oriental in Paris.\n    Uganda is the world's fifth largest coffee producer, and\nexpects to produce about 200,000 tonnes this year.\n    Market sources say roasted coffee exports will benefit\nUganda's economy as they will not be included in the 2.38 mln\n(60 kg) bag export quota assigned to the country under the\nlatest International Coffee Agreement.\n    In addition, the value of roasted coffee should be\nsubstantially higher than that of unroasted beans, they said.\n    The U.S. Is the biggest buyer of Ugandan coffee, most of\nwhich is used to produce instant coffee.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
