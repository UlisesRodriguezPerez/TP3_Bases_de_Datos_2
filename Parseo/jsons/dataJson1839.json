        "BODY": "U.S. Trade Representative Clayton\nYeutter said he plans a July trip to China to discuss trade\nissues including China's admission to the General Agreements on\nTariffs and Trade.\n    Yeutter told a congressional hearing it was possible China\ncould be a member of GATT before the end of the year.\n    \"They are making major moves to becoming a full scale member\nof the world economy,\" he told the House Appropriations\nsubcommittee which oversees his agency's budget.\n    Depending on how the negotiations go on the terms of\nChina's GATT membership, Yeutter said he could put the final\ntouches on the U.S. part of the agreement during his trip.    \nThe admission of China to GATT, which is the multinational\ngroup of nations which negotiates international rules on trade,\nwould offer both potential export markets and potential\ncompetition for U.S. industries, he said.\n    \"That has a lot of potential as well as risks for U.S.\nbusiness,\" Yeutter said.\n    \"I think China will develop into a fine market for us,\" he\nadded.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
