        "BODY": "Transnational Industries Inc said due\nto continuing manufacturing difficulties at its AlloyTek Inc\njet engine component subsidiary, it expects to report a net\nloss of about 300,000 dlrs or 12 cts per share for the fourth\nquarter ended January 31.\n    It said revenues for the period were about 11.9 mln dlrs,\nabout even with those of a year earlier.\n    For the full fiscal year, the company said it earned about\n775,000 dlrs or 34 cts per share, down from 1,402,000 dlrs or\n76 cts per share a year before.\n    The company said an unexpectedly large volume of customer\ninquiries at its Spitz Inc simulation products subsidiary has\ncaused higher than expected business development outlays.\n    The company said it expects significant contract awards to\nSpitz later this year.\n    It said it has started implementing a plan to progressively\nreduce manufacturing costs at AlloyTek over the next several\nquarters.  The company said it may move AlloyTek's plant from\nGrandville, Mich., to a lower labor cost area.\n    The company said it discovered the extent of the AlloyTek\nproblems during a year-end review of subcontracts and related\nwork in progress for production of jet engine components for\nGeneral Electric Co <GE>.\n    It said it will release annual results around April 15.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
