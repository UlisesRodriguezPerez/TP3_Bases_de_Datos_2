Goodrich Co said it will phase\nout the production of aircraft tires, missile and marine\nproducts and molded rubber products in Akron, Ohio, by the end\nof 1987, laying off about 790 salaried, production, maintenance\nand support services employees.\n    The company said layoffs will start within the next few\nweeks.\n    Goodrich said it will continue to make chemicals and\nadhesives in Akron, employing about 356.  Another 5000 salaried\nemployees in Akron work for Goodrich.\n    The company said it has not been able to operate the\nbusinesses being discontinued in Akron profitably enough to\njustify the large investment that it has in them.\n    Goodrich said it will continue to make aircraft tires at\nNorwood, N.C., and sonar domes at Jacksonville, Fla., and will\nrelocate its molded rubber products business to a site not yet\nchosen.  It said it will stop making insulators for missiles.\n    Goodrich said it is prepared to discuss with officials of\nthe United Rubber Workers Union severance benefits for affected\nemployees and issues related to the continued operation in\nAkron of the chemical and adhesives businesses and to the\nphaseout of the Akron aircraft tire, missile and marine and\nmolded rubber products manufacturing.\n    A company spokesman said it does not expect any adverse\nimpact on earnings from the move.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
