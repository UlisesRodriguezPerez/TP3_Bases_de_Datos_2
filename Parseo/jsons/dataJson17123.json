        "DATELINE": "    RATZEBURG, April 24 - ",
        "BODY": "Fine weather throughout Europe\nallowed farmers to make good progress with sugar beet sowings\nduring the period April 16-21, but conditions in the Soviet\nUnion remained unfavourable, West German analyst F.O. Licht\nsaid.\n    With daytime temperatures in parts of Europe exceeding 20\ndegrees centigrade Licht said sowings have been boosted and may\nbe completed in most countries by the end of the month.\n    In France the beet growers' association said the entire\ncrop could be sown within a week if the good weather persists.\n    Sowings this year will still be behind 1986 but Licht noted\nthat good results have often been produced from late-sown\ncrops.\n    In the Soviet Union, however, most beet-growing regions\nstill had cool weather with night frosts. Only in the western\nUkraine was it warm enough to permit sowings, Licht said.\n    Sowings in the USSR will consequently be much later than\nlast year when one mln hectares had already been drilled by\nmid-April.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
