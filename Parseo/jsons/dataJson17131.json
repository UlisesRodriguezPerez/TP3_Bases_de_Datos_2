        "BODY": "Spanish exporters are asking the\ngovernment to clear 33,200 tonnes of sunflower seed authorised\nfor export by the European Community (EC), a spokesman for one\nof Spain's major sunflower oil producers said.\n    He told Reuters in a telephone interview the government was\nholding back on authorisation to hold prices low.\n    \"They are deliberately keeping prices down to help meet this\nyear's inflation target despite the threat of a surplus on what\nlooks like a bigger harvest than we expected,\" he said.\n    He said the policy of allowing stocks to accumulate had\ncaused a price drop, with raw oil prices falling to 147 pesetas\na kilo from 160 at the start of the 1986/87 marketing year\nending July 31.\n    Sunflower oil output was expected to rise to 370,000 tonnes\nthis year from 340,000 last year, with seed output up at\n905,000 tonnes from 860,000 last year.\n    He said domestic consumption was falling due to imports of\nother edible oils. \"We estimate demand at 296,000 tonnes this\nyear, leaving a 124,000 tonne surplus with the 50,000 tonnes\nnow stockpiled,\" he said. \"If we discount 24,000 tonnes held for\nstrategic purposes, this still leaves us with 100,000 tonnes.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
