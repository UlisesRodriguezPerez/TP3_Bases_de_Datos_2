        "DATELINE": "    OSAKA, JAPAN, April 26 - ",
        "BODY": "New York Federal Reserve Bank\nPresident Gerald Corrigan opposed a further fall in the value\nof the dollar but refused to say whether U.S. Interest rates\nwould be raised to protect the currency.\n    \"A further decline in the dollar or appreciation of the yen\nat this juncture I would regard as counterproductive,\" he told a\nnews conference.\n    His comments echoed those made last week by U.S. Treasury\nSecretary James Baker, who also warned against a further dollar\nfall. The U.S. Currency plunged to a post-war low below 140 yen\nlast week, despite dollar-buying by a number of central banks.\n    Currency speculators and investors are convinced that a\nfurther dollar fall is needed to help reduce the huge U.S.\nTrade deficit, dealers said. The only thing likely to help the\ndollar is seen as a rise in U.S. Interest rates.\n    Corrigan refused to say whether the U.S. Was ready to risk\ndamaging its economic recovery by raising interest rates.\n    The dollar\"s sharp drop this month has also raised questions\nabout the usefulness of recent meetings of the Group of Seven.\nBut Corrigan said: \"They have played a constructive role in so\nfar as the broad objective of facilitating a higher degree of\neconomic policy coordination.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003"
