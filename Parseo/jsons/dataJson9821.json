Exports rose to a\nrecord 6.93 billion last month from 6.20 billion in January.\n    Trade Department officials said the improvement in\nBritain's current account contrasted with most private\nforecasts and they attributed much of the strength to imports\nrising less quickly in February than might otherwise have been\nexpected.\n    The Department said exceptionally cold weather in January\nreduced exports that month and that there had been an element\nof catching up in the February figures.\n    The seasonally adjusted volume index, base 1980, a guide to\nunderlying non-oil trade, showed exports rising to 131.0 from\n114.6 in January and imports rising to 142.2 from 136.5.\n    The value of British oil exports in February rose to 751\nmln stg from 723 mln in Jnauary while oil imports rose to 425\nmln from 352 mln.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
