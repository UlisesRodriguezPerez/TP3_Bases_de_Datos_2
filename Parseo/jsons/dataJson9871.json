        "BODY": "The Bank of France intervened on the\nmarket to buy dollars and sell yen to support the U.S.\nCurrency, dealers said.\n    A major French bank said it acted for the central bank in\nbuying between five and 15 mln dlrs against yen.\n    A dealer at another bank said his bank had been asked to\npublicise the intervention, to send a clear signal to the\nmarkets that central banks were acting in concert to maintain\nthe exchange rates agreed to be appropriate at last month's\nmeeting of the Group of Five and Canada in Paris.\n    The dollar was being quoted at 6.0950/70 francs in early\nafternoon dealings after a fix of 6.09425 francs.\n    The major French bank said it sold yen at a rate of 149.28\nagainst the dollar.\n    The U.S. Currency was subsequently being quoted at\n149.25/35.\n    The Bank of Japan was reported in the market overnight to\nbolster the credibility of the Paris accord following several\ndays of pressure against the dollar.\n    Pressure developed after U.S. Treasury Secretary James\nBaker repeated earlier statements that the Reagan\nadministration had no targets for the dollar, apparently\nundermining the assumption that the agreement in Paris had\nfixed broad fluctuation ranges for major currencies.\n    Baker later said his remark had been misinterpreted.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
