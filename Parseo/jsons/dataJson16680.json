        "BODY": "Shares of Dome Petroleum Ltd posted\ntheir biggest gain in months in the U.S. and Canada as stock\nmarkets foresaw a takeover tug-of-war beginning for the\ndebt-heavy company.\n    Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange and\ngained 31 cents to 1.44 Canadian dlrs on the Toronto Stock\nExchange, where it was the most active stock. It rose as high\nas 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Dome\nhas normally moved by only a few cents per day.\n    TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlr\nCanadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, but\nDome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also still\ntalking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify.\n    Market analysts today said the other two firms are believed\nto be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterday\nstressed that its bid is \"a Canadian solution to the financial\ndifficulties of Dome Petroleum.\"\n    \"The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont\n<DD>, and Atlantic Richfield Co <ARC>, which sold its Canadian\ninterest in 1975 and could be getting back in,\" said Wilf Gobert\nof Peters and Co Ltd.\n    David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that British\nPetroleum PLC <BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despite\nBP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percent\nof Standard Oil Co <SRD> it does not already own.\n    Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has said\nin recent reports that Amoco Corp <AN> has also been in talks\nwith Dome.\n    Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum,\nConoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment.\n    Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as \"awfully\noptimistic,\" given TransCanada's offer to give current Dome\nshareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10\ndlrs Canadian per common share.\n    Under the offer, current Dome common and preferred\nshareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, which\nwould own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanada\nwould own 80 pct.\n    However, Bryson said the market may be looking at the\npotential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. \"The\nTransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,\"\nhe said.\n    Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is \"at the\nupper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome.\"\n    The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87\nbillion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with another\none billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available to\nsecured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above a\ncertain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level.\n    Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billion\nCanadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took on\nseveral years ago when oil prices were high and the company\nwanted to expand.\n    \"There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capable\nof supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on that\nbasis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,\"\nGobert said.\n    Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that it\nis a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holds\nreserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billion\ncubic feet of natural gas.\n    The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acres\nof oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, the\nheart of Canada's oil industry.\n   Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres of\nland across Canada.\n   The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrs\nCanadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.). It reported a 1986 loss of\n2.2 billion dlrs (1.65 billion dlrs U.S.), believed to be the\nlargest ever by a Canadian company.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003"
