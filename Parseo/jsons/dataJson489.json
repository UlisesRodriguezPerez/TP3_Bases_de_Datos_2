        "BODY": "A study group said the United States\nshould increase its strategic petroleum reserve to one mln\nbarrels as one way to deal with the present and future impact\nof low oil prices on the domestic oil industry.\n    U.S. policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750\nmln barrels, from its present 500 mln, to help protect the\neconomy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise.\n    The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, a private\ngroup, also called for new research for oil exploration and\ndevelopment techniques.\n    It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs a\nbarrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s, with\nimports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption.\n    It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reserves\nand more exploration and development research would help to\nguard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
