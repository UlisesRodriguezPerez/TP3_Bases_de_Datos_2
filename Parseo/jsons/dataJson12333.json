        "BODY": "Most major U.S. banks today matched\nTuesday's quarter-point prime rate cuts by Citibank and Chase\nManhattan Bank, the first prime rate boosts since mid-1984.\n    Most cited narrower spreads between the prime and funding\ncosts as justification. Analysts said the prime rate rises may\nhave been triggered partly by a desire by banks to enhance\nprofit margins given problems with developing country loans. \n    Commenting on the prime rate increases, U.S. Treasury\nSecretary James Baker told a House Appropriations Committee\nthat \"I hope it was a temporary blip upward.\"\n    Among the major banks which today announced prime rate\nincreases to 7-3/4 pct were Bankers Trust, Chemical Bank,\nContinental Illinois National Bank, Harris Trust and Savings\nBank, Irving Trust, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co, Marine\nMidland, and Security Pacific National Bank.\n    Other banking companies announcing prime rate rises\nincluded Pittsburgh National Bank, Texas Commerce Bank-Houston,\nProvident National Bank, First National Bank of Boston, Florida\nFederal Savings and Loan Association, and SunTrust Banks.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
