        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, June 2 - ",
        "BODY": "Britain's gold and currency reserves rose\na record underlying 4.76 billion dlrs in May, following April's\n2.9 billion dlrs increase, the Treasury said.\n    The underlying trend indicates the level of recent Bank of\nEngland intervention on currency markets to curb sterling's\nstrength. It was above market expectations which had been for a\nrise of between one billion and three billion dlrs.\n    The Treasury declined comment on the figures.\n    Actual reserves rose 4.87 billion dlrs in May, compared\nwith April's 2.8 billion increase, to a total value of 34.68\nbillion dlrs, compared with 29.81 billion at the end of April.\n    Borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 238 mln\ndlrs, against April's 66 mln. Repayments under the scheme were\n85 mln dlrs, after 90 mln previously, with capital repayments\nof eight mln, after three mln last month.\n    Repayments of government debt amounted to 33 mln dlrs.\n    The underlying reserves increase is net of borrowings and\nrepayments.\n    It was larger than the previous record 3.04 billion dlrs\nrise seen in October 1977. The May increase represents the\nseventh monthly rise, with reserves up 9.947 billion dlrs in\nthat period, and up 9.816 billion since the start of 1987.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
