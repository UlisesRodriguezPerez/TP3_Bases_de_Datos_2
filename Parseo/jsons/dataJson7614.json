        "BODY": "The Bank of Spain suspended its daily\nmoney market assistance and offered to drain funds with three-\nand seven-day repurchase agreements at 12-1/2 pct, money market\nsources said.\n    The sources said the measures were a further attempt to\nrein in money supply and were likely to force some institutions\nto scramble for funds before the 10-day accounting period for\nreserve requirements closes on Monday.\n    The bank, which raised its rate for ordinary overnight\nassistance to 13-3/4 from 13-1/2 pct on Wednesday, opened its\nspecial borrowing facility for overnight funds at 14-1/2 pct.\n    Money market sources said institutions in need of funds\nwere likely to have to return to the bank tomorrow for further\nassistance.\n    The bank rarely invites applications for ordinary\nassistance on a Saturday and the sources said it was more\nlikely to open its special borrowing facility again.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
