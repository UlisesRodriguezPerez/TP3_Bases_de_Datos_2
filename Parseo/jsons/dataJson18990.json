        "BODY": "Italy's economic outlook for 1987 and 1988\nis likely to be less favourable than last year with slightly\nlower growth, higher unemployment and an increased trade\ndeficit, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment (OECD) said.\n    But the OECD, in its half-yearly report, forecast a\nslightly lower inflation rate over the next two years. Last\nyear Italy ranked as one of the OECD's fastest growing\neconomies with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 2.7 pct.\n    The OECD said Italy's GDP may grow by three pct in 1987,\nbut will then fall back to 2.5 pct in 1988.\n    The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around five\npct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround in\nimport prices, particularly oil, an acceleration in labour\ncosts and the effects of domestic demand pressure, the report\nsaid.\n    This year, and to a lesser degree in 1988, domestic demand\nshould be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumption\nmade possible by wage increases following pay negotiations.\n    Domestic demand pressure, coupled with the deterioration in\nItalian competitiveness, is likely to stimulate imports and\nadversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988. This could result in\na sharp negative contribution to the currrent account.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
