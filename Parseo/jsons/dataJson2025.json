        "BODY": "Responsibility for the appreciation of\nthe Taiwan dollar and the South Korean Won lies soley with\nthose countries, said U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter\n    Speaking to the Asia Society, Yeutter said that it is in\nthose countries' own long-term interest to raise the value of\ntheir currencies against the dollar.\n    Yeutter was responding to a question about what the U.S.\ncould do to encourage appreciation of those currencies against\nthe dollar in order to reduce the large U.S. trade deficits\nwith Taiwain and Korea.\n    \"An undervalued currency will help those countries' exports\nin the short term, but in the long run they have to be\nconcerned about how they are perceived in the international\nbusiness community,\" Yeutter said.\n    For Taiwan, Yeutter said that with its per capita trade\nsurplus with the U.S., much larger than that of Japan's, and\nwith huge foreign exchange reserves, it was difficult to defend\nthe high import tarrifs and other barriers that prevail in that\ncountry.\n    He also said that the south Korean Won should begin to move\nto reflect underlying economic fundamentals, \"otherwise in two\nor three years' time, Korea will be in the same situation that\nprevails in Taiwan.\"\n    Turning to the U.S. deficit with Japan of more than 50\nbillion dlrs, Yeutter said that this situation was not\nsustainable.\n    \"Something must give soon. If not, there is a great threat\nof U.S. legislative action to counteract that trend,\" Yeutter\nsaid.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
