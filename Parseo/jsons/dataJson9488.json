        "BODY": "Combustion Engineering Inc said\nit expects first quarter earnings to be 20 to 25 pct below the\nyear-ago 13.6 mln dlrs, mainly due to financing costs resulting\nfrom the January 1987 acquisition of AccuRay Corp.\n    The company said it has filed for an offering of four mln\ncommon shares and 150 mln dlrs of subordinated debentures due\n2017, with proceeds to be used to refinance the short-term bank\ndebt incurred for the AccuRay acquisition, to finance other\ncosts of the transaction and for general corporate purposes.\n    Combustion said 3,500,000 shares will be sold in the U.S.\nand the remainder overseas.\n    Combustion paid about 218 mln dlrs for AccuRay, a maker of\ncomputer-based measurement and control systems used in pulp and\npaper mills.\n    The company said it expects to release first quarter\nresults in the third week in April.\n    Combustion said it expects further restructuring of core\nbusinesses -- particularly Lummus Crest -- this year through\nstaff reductions downsizings and the consolidation of\nfacilities.\n    Combustion said the restructuring at Lummus Crest is\nexpected to substantially reduce but not eliminate this year\nlosses in the Engineering and Construction segment.\n    But it said improvement at Lummus Crest is expected to be\napproximately offset by a number of factors, including a\nsomewhat lower level of earnings in the Power Generation\nsegment than in 1986, financing costs of the AccuRay\nacquisition, costs associated with integrating AccuRay\ntechnology and operations and delays in waste to energy\nprojects.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
