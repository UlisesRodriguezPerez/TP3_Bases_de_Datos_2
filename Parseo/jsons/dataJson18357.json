        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, June 2 - ",
        "BODY": "The House today approved a bill\nrequiring the Reagan administration to report to Congress on\nits Mideast Gulf policy but not restricting its actions.\n    The vote in favor was despite a last-minute revolt by an\nalliance of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who\nsought to defeat it as a signal that a growing number of\nlegislators oppose President Reagan's policies in the region.\n    In the Senate, a leading Republican senator, former Senate\nAppropriations Committee Chairman Mark Hatfield of Oregon, said\nhe would try to prevent consideration of the bill.\n    He said he will put a so-called \"hold\" on the bill until he\nfinds out whether the War Powers Act applies to protecting\nKuwaiti tankers.\n    Congressional leaders complain they were not consulted\nabout plans to put the U.S. flag on Kuwaiti ships and some\ncharged the policy could lead the U.S. into the Iran-Iraq war.\n    Conservative Republicans said increasing the U.S. military\nobligation in the gulf would place impossible burdens on\nAmerican servicemen and equipment, and warned it could lead to\nwar.\n    \"It is a real snake pit at best and a powder keg that will\nblow sky-high at worst,\" said Wisconsin Rep. Toby Roth.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003"
