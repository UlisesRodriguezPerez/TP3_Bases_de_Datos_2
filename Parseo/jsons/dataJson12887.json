        "BODY": "Pakistan is not emerging as a major\nwheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough,\nSartaj Aziz, Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to the\nPakistani Prime Minister, said in an interview.\n    No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and\nplans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothing\nbecause they could not agree a price, he said.\n    Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surpluses\nof one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few\nharvests in years when the weather is favourable.\n    The government does not wish to increase output much above\nthis because of low world prices, and the land would be better\nused for other crops.\n    Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sown\nto wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. Some\n10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to\nmore profitable crops such as oilseeds.\n    The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the\ncurrent 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per ha\nover the next five to seven years, he said.\n    Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which is\njust beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mln\ntonnes. This compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year's\nyield of 14.0 mln.\n    He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more\nrecent rains reduced prospects slightly.\n    The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mln\ntonnes by mid-1993, taking into account Pakistan's annual\npopulation growth rate of more than three pct. Current\nconsumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes.\n    The current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes, Aziz said.\nThis compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln\ntonnes, which Pakistan will maintain at all costs, and a\n\"strategic reserve\" target of two mln tonnes.\n    Despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes over\ntarget, the surplus will not be exported at present, he said.\n    The government wants to keep an extra \"safety margin\" until\nit sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheat\nrationing system will have on domestic consumption. New exports\nwill be considered only in about a year's time when the 1987/88\ncrop can be gauged as well, he said.\n    The new domestic policy, introduced on March 15, is for the\ngovernment to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two\nrupees per kilo. With other costs this means a price in\nPakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo.\n    Under the old system, introduced during World War Two and\ndue to be phased out by April 15, some 50 mln ration cards were\nissued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply.\n    Aziz said following the introduction of a government\nsupport price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that\nonly 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the\nconsumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills.\n    The ration system had also not had the stabilising effect\non the internal wheat market that was intended, Aziz said.\n    Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of\nthe new system. The wheat price in Karachi, the most expensive\nPakistani city, had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on March\n1 to 2.85 rupees on March 30.\n    Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a\nmajor effect on total consumption, but it may encourage better\nuse of side-products such as bran.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
