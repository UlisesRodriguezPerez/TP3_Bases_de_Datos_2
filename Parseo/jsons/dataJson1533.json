        "BODY": "Thomas Berger, Deputy Assistant\nSecretary of the Treasury, said that a further drop in the\nexchange value of the dollar could cause prices to go up and\ntrigger inflation.\n    He told a meeting of the President's Export Council that\nthe Japanese and the Germans have cut their profit margins to\nreflect recent drops in the dollar, so prices have remained\nmuch the same.\n    But he added that if the dollar dropped further there could\nbe inflation in the United States.\n    Berger also said that a further devalued dollar may cause\neconomic depressions in some U.S. trading partners, and that\nwould not be in America's interest because it would close those\nmarkets to U.S. goods.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
