        "DATELINE": "    TOKYO, April 2 - ",
        "BODY": "The Finance Ministry has asked trust banks\nto moderate their dollar selling, trust banking sources said.\n    A Ministry official told Reuters earlier this week the\nMinistry had recently surveyed foreign exchange transactions by\ninstitutional investors, but he declined to say whether this\nwas aimed at moderating the dollar sales.\n    Dealers said institutional investors were reluctant to sell\ndollars aggressively today partly because of the Ministry\nmonitoring.\n    One senior trust bank source said that while sympathizing\nwith the Ministry position, the trust banks had to conduct\ntheir foreign exchange operations according to the dictates of\nthe market.\n    A Bank of Japan official said the central bank approved of\nthe survey as long it was not used too forcefully.\n    But another official denied local press reports that the\ncentral bank itself had asked investors to moderate their\ndollar sales. \"We are not legally authorized to do that,\" he\nsaid.\n    A Bank of Japan official also said the central bank will\nrenew its call on financial institutions to moderate excessive\nloans for the purpose of land and securities investment as such\ninvestments threaten to cause inflation.\n    Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita had previously\nexpressed concern about excessive investment in land and\nsecurities resulting partly from eased credit conditions.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
