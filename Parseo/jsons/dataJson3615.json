        "BODY": "The U.S. merchandise trade deficit\non a balance of payments basis was a record 38.37 billion dlrs\nin the October to December fourth quarter, the Commerce\nDepartment said.\n    The record trade shortfall came after a revised 37.15\nbillion dlr third quarter deficit. The department previously\nreported the third quarter deficit was 37.67 billion dlrs.\n    For the full year 1986, the merchandise trade deficit was a\nrecord 147.7 billion dlrs, up from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985,\nthe department said.\n    During the final quarter last year imports rose 2.78\nbillion dlrs or three pct to 95.7 billion dlrs, while exports\nrose 1.56 billion dlrs or three pct to 57.33 billion dlrs.\n    The trade report on a balance of payments basis excludes\nsuch factors as military sales and the costs of shipping and\ninsurance.\n    The Commerce Department said non-petroleum imports in the\nquarter were up 2.7 billion dlrs or three pct to 87.7 billion\ndlrs, with the largest increases in consumer goods, which rose\n1.2 billion dlrs, and in non-monetary gold and passenger cars\nfrom Canada, up 900 mln dlrs each.\n    Lumber imports from Canada fell 300 mln dlrs or 33 pct\nbecause of a 15 pct duty on imports from Canada, the department\nsaid. Passenger car imports fell 600 mln dlrs because of an 18\npct decrease in the number of South Korean-made imported cars\nand a nine pct decrease from Japan.\n    On the exports side, agricultural exports rose 600 mln dlrs\nor nine pct to 7.1 billion dlrs, primarily because of a 104 pct\nor 600 mln dlr increase in soybean exports.\n    Soybean shipments to Western Europe rose sharply because\nsupplies from Brazil, a traditional major exporter, were\nlimited by drought.\n    Commerce said the U.S. trade deficit with Latin America\nrose 900 mln dlrs to 2.6 billion dlrs, with Japan increased 700\nmln dlrs to 14.8 billion dlrs and with Western Europe rose 200\nmln to 7.2 billion dlrs in the quarter.\n    The deficit with newly industrialized Far East countries,\nincluding Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, fell\n500 mln dlrs to eight billion dlrs and with Canada the deficit\ndecreased 200 mln dlrs to 3.3 billion dlrs in the quarter.\n    In the full year 1986, imports rose 30.6 billion dlrs or\nnine pct to 369.5 billion dlrs. Exports increased by only 7.3\nbillion dlrs or three pct to 221.8 billion dlrs.\n    Commerce said petroleum imports during 1986 fell 16.6\nbillion dlrs or 33 pct to 33.9 billion dlrs because of lower\nprices. The average price per barrel decreased to 14.72 dlrs\nfrom 26.41 dlrs.\n    Agricultural exports fell by 2.6 billion dlrs or nine pct\nto 26.9 billion during the year. The average price of rice fell\n27 pct, cotton was down 22 pct, corn 18 pct, wheat 16 pct and\nsoybeans nine pct.\n    The trade deficit with Japan for all of 1986 rose 11.1\nbillion dlrs to 54.6 billion dlrs and with Western Europe\nincreased 7.2 billion dlrs to 28.6 billion dlrs.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
