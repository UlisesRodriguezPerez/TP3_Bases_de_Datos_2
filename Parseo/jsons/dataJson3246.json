        "BODY": "This year will see a pickup in U.S.\neconomic growth and inflation, the Shadow Open Market Committee\nsaid in its semi-annual policy statement.\n    The SOMC, a group of basically \"monetarist\" private\neconomists, said that \"economic growth will accelerate in 1987\nin response to powerful stimulative actions by the Federal\nReserve.\"\n    The group said the Fed's actions have been excessive. As a\nresult, it said that \"inflation and ultimately another\nrecession now loom on the horizon.\"\n    The SOMC said that central bank policies that rely on\nprogressively larger swings in monetary expansion will not lead\nto sustainable economic growth and stable prices.\n    The group made no specific nominal forecasts of economic or\ninflation growth in its policy statement. However, the\nCommittee at its Sunday policy-making meeting said it was\nbasically in accord with projections by Jerry Jordan, who is a\nmember of the SOMC and economist at First Interestate Bancorp.\n    Jordan expects real GNP growth to be about one percentage\npoint higher than in the past two years. He expects consumer\nprices to rise about 4-1/2 pct this year.\n    The SOMC said in recent months rapid money growth has been\na principal cause of the devaluation. To avoid another costly\ninflation and disinflation, the SOMC urged the Fed to \"abandon\nits inflationary policy and set the growth rate of the monetary\nbase on the path toward sustained lower inflation.\"\n    The Fed in February said it would no longer target the\nnarrow M-1 money supply because the link between M-1 and\neconomic growth has been largely severed.\n\n\u0003"
