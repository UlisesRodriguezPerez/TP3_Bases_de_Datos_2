        "BODY": "William Crowe, chairman of the U.S.\nJoint Chiefs of Staff, predicted Iran will retaliate for the\nU.S. strike against its oil platform though he said Iranian\noptions were limited.\n    \"They will be determined. They will not be easily deterred,\nand let me stress for you that our commitment there is not\ngoing to be risk free or casualty free.\"\n    He said the most likely Iranian response would involve\nterrorism or the laying of mines.\n    \"They obviously will look for ways that are probably more in\nline with the 'silent hand' than what they have tried thus far,\"\nCrowe told an American Stock Exchange conference.\n    He declined comment on a reporter's query whether he\nfavored a stronger move against Iran than that ordered by the\npresident.\n    \"We carried out the operation that was decided upon and we\ncarried it out with enthusiasm and I think it was\nprofessionally and well done,\" Crowe said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
