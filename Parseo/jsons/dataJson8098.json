        "TITLE": "U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - MINI-REFUNDING",
        "AUTHOR": "    By Claire Miller, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, March 23 - ",
        "BODY": "A hefty slice of new U.S. Treasury\nsupply is not the most welcome prospect for a slumbering credit\nmarket, but at least this week's offerings should provide it\nwith some focus, economists said.\n    \"Banks and mutual funds have cash that should be put to\nwork, so the auctions should breathe some life into the market,\"\nsaid economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.\n    The Treasury will place a 25 billion dlr package of\ntwo-year, four-year and seven-year notes on the sales block\nthis week.\n    The \"mini-refunding,\" which will raise 9.27 billion dlrs in\nnew cash, comprises 10 billion dlrs of two-year notes for\nauction on Tuesday, 7.75 billion dlrs of four-year notes on\nWednesday and 7.25 billion dlrs of seven-year notes on\nThursday. The market also faces the regular weekly three- and\nsix-month bill auction today, amounting to 12.8 billion dlrs.\n    The mini-refunding does not come at a particularly\nauspicious time for the market. Bond prices have been drifting\nsideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudy\nU.S. Economic outlook, diminished chances of a change in\nFederal Reserve Board policy and a stable dollar.\n    Moreover, the bond market's inertia has compared\nunfavourably with the rash of activity taking place in\nhigh-yield markets overseas, like the U.K., As well as in U.S.\nEquities.\n    But according to the Merrill Lynch economists, there are\nsigns the pall hanging over the U.S. Bond market is lifting a\nbit.\n    \"Customer activity has been light, but all on the buy-side,\nand there is a marked absence of selling,\" they said in a weekly\nreport.\n    Philip Braverman of Irving Trust Securities Inc believes\nbanks will snap up the two- and four-year issues at this week's\nsales.\n    \"The banks are in need of investments that provide earnings.\nThough the yield spread to the cost of carrying these\nmaturities has been wider, it is still positive,\" he said in a\nweekly market review.\n    But economists agreed not even the auctions will generate\nenough impetus for a major move. This will only come once the\noverseas markets have had their run.\n    \"Based on last week's events, there is little to indicate\nthat the appetite for yield has begun to wane,\" said economists\nat Salomon Brothers Inc.\n    Indeed, talk persisted last week that Japanese investors\nare planning to re-weight their portfolios in favour of the\nhigher-yielding markets at the start of Japan's new fiscal year\non April 1.\n    And while traditionally the Japanese have not been big\nbuyers of the shorter-dated issues on offer at this week's U.S.\nAuctions, such reports undermine market confidence.\n    Even actions by the British, Australian and Canadian\nmonetary authorities to curb the rise of their currencies\nshould also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bond\nmarkets, the Salomon Brothers' economists said.\n    Meanwhile, ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven the\nU.S. Market unless they deviate widely from expectations,\neconomists said.\n    This week's economic calendar begins on Tuesday with\nFebruary durable goods orders. Economists expect a rebound from\nJanuary's depressed levels.\n    Peter Greenbaum of Smith, Barney, Harris Upham and Co said\nseveral areas, including transport equipment, should have\nbounced back. But a decline in military capital goods will cap\ntotal new orders. He forecasts a rise of two pct after\nJanuary's 6.7 pct slump. Some other economists foresee a gain\nas large as five pct.\n    Friday's consumer price report for February is expected to\nshow an increase of about 0.3 pct after a 0.7 pct January gain.\nEconomists said energy prices -- the driving force behind the\nJanuary rise -- rose more moderately last month, while food\nprices declined.\n    Meanwhile, economists warned that the federal funds rate\nwill be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to the\napproach of quarter-end and the mid-April tax date.\n    Some economists expect the Fed to execute a bill pass this\nweek because its adding requirement increases sharply in the\nnew statement period beginning on Thursday.\n    Fed funds traded at 6-1/16 pct late Friday and are expected\nto open near that level.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
