        "DATELINE": "    New York, April 3 - ",
        "BODY": "E.F. Hutton LBO Inc is still interested\nin an acquisition of Purolator Courier Corp, and is examining\nthe possibility of raising its 35 dlr per share offer, an E.F.\nHutton spokesman said.\n    Hutton's offer was topped by a 40 dlr per share offer from\nEmery Air Freight Corp <EAF> earlier this week.\n    \"We're definately not out of it at this point,\" the Hutton\nspokesman said.\n    \"We want to see what the offer is completely and understand\nit fully, and then fashion our response,\" the spokesman said.\n    After Emery made its offer, Hutton extended the deadline on\nits offer to Monday. The offer was to have expired Wednesday.\n    Analysts said it might be difficult for Hutton to raise the\noffer since Emery, an overnight courier, might have an easier\ntime justifying a lofty price since it would realize cost\nsavings by combining its business with those of Purolator.\n    Purolator, a New Jersey-based overnight courier, has\ndeclined comment.\n    Purolator had traded above the Hutton offer price on\nspeculation a new bidder would emerge. It was up 1/8 today at\n40-3/8, above the Emery offer.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
