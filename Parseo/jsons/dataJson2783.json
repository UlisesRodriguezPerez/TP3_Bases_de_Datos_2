        "BODY": "Telecom Plus International Inc\nsaid <Siemens AG>'s Siemens Information Systems wants to amend\nits agreement to purchase Telecom's 65 pct interest in Tel Plus\nCommunications to delay payment of 25 mln dlrs for 11 months.\n    Telecom's shareholders are scheduled to vote on the 165 mln\ndlr transaction Monday.\n    Telecom said it advised Siemens it intends to close the\ntransaction on March 16, as scheduled, if it is approved by\nshareholders. A spokesman said this means Telecom will decide\nbefore the 16th whether or not to accept the proposed change.\n    Explaining its request for the amendment, Siemens informed\nTelecom it had recently become aware of information causing\nconcern with respect to certain accounting and other matters.\n    Siemens said it will therefore need to continue its review\nbeyond March 16 to determine whether certain representations\nand warranties are true.\n    Telecom said it advised Siemens it knows of no information\nwhich would make its representations and warranties untrue.\n    Siemens already owns the remaining 35 pct of Tel Plus. The\n65 pct represenmts Telecom's principal operating asset.\n    A Telecom spokesman said the agreement calls for payment of\nall but 29 mln dlrs of the price at closing. Of this, 21 mln\ndlrs was to be paid 11 months later and two mln dlrs per year\non the anniversary date of the transaction.\n    He said Siemens is now proposing that 25 mln dlrs be added\nto the 21 mln dlrs to be paid in 11 months.\n    Telecom said the proposed amendment would also permit\nSiemens to defer repayment of up to an additional 50 pct of\ncertain intercompany debt until completion of the review.\nTelecom said it estimates this to ba about 15 mln dlrs.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
