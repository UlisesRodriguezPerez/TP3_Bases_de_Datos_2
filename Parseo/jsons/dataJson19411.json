        "BODY": "Dayton Hudson Corp, in a\nletter to employees, said it told an \"aggressive buyer\" of the\ncompany's stock that it does not want to be acquired.\n    A Dayton Hudson spokeswoman would not identify the buyer,\nbut Wall Street sources said Dart Group Corp <DARTA.O> was the\ncompany interested in buying Dayton Hudson stock.\n    The Wall Street sources said the Dart Group is expected\nsoon to file a statement with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission on its accumulation of Dayton Hudson stock.\n    According to the letter to company employess, Dayton Hudson\nmanagement has moved in two directions to fend off a takeover.\nAccording to the letter, chairman Kenneth Macke expressed to\nthe group buying its stock the company's desire to remain\nindependent.\n    Dayton Hudson Thursday night met with Minnesota governor\nRudy Perpich, appealing for legislative help.\n    A spokesman for Governor Perpich earlier said the governor\nis expected later today to recommend stiffening the state's\nanti-takeover law to help the Minneopolis retailer defend\nitself.\n    Minnesota House speaker designate said the legislators\nwould probably look at language similar to that contained in\nIndiana and New York law. He said any amendment proposed would\nprobably be designed to thwart a company from dismantling a\ncompany for its own profit.\n   \"Obviously Dayton-Hudson people feel whatever statutes we\nhave would not protect them enough,\" Vanasek said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
