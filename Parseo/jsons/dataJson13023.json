        "BODY": "FCS Laboratories Inc said merger\ndiscussions with an unnamed privately-held company in the\nhealth care field have ended without an agreement.\n    The previously announced negotiations began last August,\nthe company said.\n    \"It's disappointing to spend so much time on these\nnegotiations and have them fail,\" said FCS chairman Nicholas\nGallo III. \"But the discussions could not produce a deal\nacceptable to our board in the context of the company's\nstronger financial position today as compared to six months\nago.\"\n    Gallo said FCS will stop actively seeking potential merger\npartners, but will respond to serious inquiries.\n    \"We are determined to follow our plan to restore this\ncompany to profitability,\" he said. \"To continue actively\nsearching for potential acquirers inherently forces us to\npostpone the implementation of critical decisions which are\npart of the plan.\"\n    The company, which has 4,475,930 common shares outstanding,\nreaffirmed it expects to be profitable in the second half of\nthe fiscal year ending September 30, 1987.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
