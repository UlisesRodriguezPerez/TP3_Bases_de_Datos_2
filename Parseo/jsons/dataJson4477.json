        "BODY": "Purolator Courier corp's stock rose on\nspecualtion that a disgruntled former Purolator director would\nfind a new suitor for the company, traders said.\n    Purolator agreed in late February to a 35 dlr-a-share, 265\nmln-dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain members of\nits Purolator courier division's management.\n    The stock today hit 36-1/4, up one.\n    Today, Purolator revealed in a filing with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission that director Doresy Gardner resigned\nfrom its board of directors in a letter dated March 10.\n    The letter from Gardner said he resigned the board because\nthe merger agreement with Hutton barred directors from\nsoliciting new offers and he believes shareholders might get a\nbetter deal. Gardner said he believes a better offer might be\nfound if the company would agree to be sold to some other\nentity, or if it could sell off all or part of its U.S. courier\ndivision.\n    \"Basically, (the courier division) is a company that has\n450 mln dlrs in revenues. It's a very large company and it's\nbeing sold for 50 or 60 mln dlrs,\" said Gardner in a telephone\ninterview with Reuters.\n    Gardner is an official of Kelso Management, a firm\nassociated with Fidelity International Ltd. A group of Fidelity\ncompanies owns eight pct of Purolator, and Gardner said he\npersonally owns 20,000 shares.\n    A Purolator official said the company has no comment on the\nletter from Gardner.\n    Arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger service\nmay emerge as a likely bidder for Purolator. Before the\ntransaction with Hutton LBO was announced, analysts had also\nspeculated another courier company would be the most likely\nsuitor.\n    While one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be no\nnew bidders, he said the possibility one could appear pushed\nthe stock into play again.\n    \"There's no shortage of possibilities. It's just a question\nof management's willingness to let the process continue,\" said\none arbitrager.\n    Arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because they\nbelieve Hutton LBO has taken on no risk in the transaction.\nHutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of Purolator at 35 dlrs\ncash per share. The balance of Purolator's stock will be bought\nfor securities and warrants in a new company holding the U.S.\ncourier operations.\n    The arbitragers said tender offer documents show that\nHutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction and\nwill emerge with a giant, majority equity interest in\nPurolator.\n    \"As far as I can tell from the public documents from the\ndeal that's on the table, Hutton is basically putting up zero.\nOne always likes a situation like that. You always like to\nthink if they can do this deal at no risk, there should be\nsomeone else in the world that could do it higher,\" said one\narbitrager.\n    The firm, however, is supplying temporary financing, and\nsources close to the transaction disputed the claim that the\nfirm will not end up paying for its equity position.\n    While one scenario mentioned in the tender offer document\ndid note that the E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary may not have to\nkeep cash in the transaction, the sources said there is some\nrisk to the firm.\n    \"There are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash,\nand all sorts of things that make it very speculative,\" said\none of the sources, adding there are also severance payments to\nemployees.\n    The E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary is supplying 279 mln dlrs\nin so-called \"bridge\" financing for the transaction. The bridge\nfinancing is a temporary loan from Hutton.\n    The financing is to be replaced with permanent financing,\nexpected to come from banks. However, it may take some time to\nreplace the financing, the source said, resulting in what could\nbe a substantial expense to the firm.\n    Gardner said Hutton stands to gain fees of 10 to 20 mln\ndlrs from the transaction, but sources close to the transaction\nsaid fees are at the low end of the scale.\n    \"It's a very complex transaction, but basically what\nhappens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recapture\nany investment they might have once the merger takes place,\"\nGardner said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
