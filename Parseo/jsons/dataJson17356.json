        "BODY": "U.S. Secretary of State George\nShultz said it was up to the Agriculture Department to decide\nwhether to offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union.\n    Shultz told the Newspaper Farm Editors of America that a \nwheat bonus offer to the Soviet Union \"is something that I\nbasically leave to the Agriculture Department to figure out.\"\n    Last year, Shultz spoke out against President Reagan's\ndecision to offer subsidized U.S. wheat to the Soviet Union --\nan offer Moscow spurned.\n    \"I've always been a little put off by the idea that we would\narrange our food supplies so as to price them in such a way\nthat the Soviet housewife could buy American-produced food for\nless than the American housewife could buy it,\" Shultz said.\n    \"It also seems to me that if we are going to sell in world\nmarkets, we have to meet the price,\" he added.\n    Shultz called proposals to broaden the eligibility criteria\nof USDA's export enhancement program (EEP) to include all U.S.\ncustomers \"questionable.\"\n    An across-the-board EEP would mark a \"considerable change\" in\nthe current program, which Shultz said is designed \"to say to\nother countries that subsidize, particularly the European\nCommon Market, that we're not going to give up our markets to\nthose subsidized sales and we'll have a little kit bag that\nwill meet that competition and hold our markets for our\nfarmers.\"\n    \"If you just go across-the-board and subsidize everything,\nthat's a different order of program and seems to me quite\nquestionable,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
