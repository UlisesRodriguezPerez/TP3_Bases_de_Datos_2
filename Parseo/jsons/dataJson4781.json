        "BODY": "Dutch port and transport union, FNV,\nhas called off the strikes against planned redundancies that\nhave hit Rotterdam port's general cargo sector for the past\neight weeks, strike leader Paul Rosenmuller told a mass\nmeeting.\n    The decision followed yesterday's ruling by an Amsterdam\ncourt preventing the sector's employers continuing with current\nplans for 350 redundancies this year until the court sits again\non May 7, Rosenmuller told a meeting of the general cargo\nsector's 4,000 workers today.\n    The court ruled the employers had made a mistake in the\ncomplicated legal procedure for obtaining official permission\nfor the redundancies, and therefore could not proceed.\n    \"There is no need to continue the strikes for the moment now\nthe immediate pressure of redundancies has been lifted,\"\nRosenmuller said.\n    But he added that the strikes, which began on January 19 in\nprotest against plans for 800 redundancies by 1990, could\nresume at any time before May 7 if the employers made any moves\nto re-apply for permission for the redundancies.\n    SVZ labour relations manager Gerrard Zeebregts said they\nwould be meeting their lawyers today with a view to re-applying\nfor this permission next week in the hope of gaining approval\nfor the redundancies within a month.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
