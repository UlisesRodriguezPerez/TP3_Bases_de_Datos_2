        "TITLE": "CANADIANS URGE EXEMPTION FROM U.S. TRADE BILL",
        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, April 7 - ",
        "BODY": "A group of Canadian lawmakers from\nOntario today asked their U.S. counterparts to exempt Canada\nfrom the mandatory trade retaliation provisions in a major\ntrade bill being considered by the U.S. Congress.\n    At a meeting of the Northeast-Midwest Coalition, an\norganization of U.S. legislators, David Cooke, chairman of the\nOntario Parliament's Select Committee on Economic Affairs, said\nthe exemption would help trade relations.\n    The trade legislation to be considered by the full House in\nlate April would require President Reagan to retaliate against\nforeign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions would\nharm the U.S. economy.\n    Currently, Reagan can reject trade sanctions on any\ngrounds.\n    Cooke, a member of the Liberal party, told the U.S.\ncongressmen, \"I can understand (the trade bill). I think it has\nto do with concerns you have with the other parts of the world.\"\n    \"I would suggest to you that we are your best friends. You\ndo not have those concerns with Canada and you should sincerely\nconsider exempting our country from that bill,\" he added.\n    Canada is the United States' largest trading partner, with\ntwo-way trade more than 113 billion dlrs in 1985, according to\nthe coalition. But the U.S. ran up a 23 billion dlr deficit in\nmanufactured goods that year compared to a 14 billion dlr\nsurplus in services trade with its neighbour.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
