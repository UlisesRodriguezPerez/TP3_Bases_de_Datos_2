That will enable Germany\nand France to move closer together, which is currently\nnecessary,\" he was quoted as saying.\n    \"Given the situtation of the EC (European Community) and of\nthe importance for our future connunications audiences and of\ncooperation already undertaken on the Community level, that\nseems the best choice,\" Delors added.\n    Five groups, including an alliance between West Germany's\nSiemens AG <SIEG.F> and France's Schneider S.A. <SCHN.PA>\nsubsidiary Jeumont-Schneider, have applied to buy what is\nFrance's second largest telephone switching firm.\n    Under French privatisation law, foreign companies are\nrestricted to a 20 pct stake in privatised companies.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
