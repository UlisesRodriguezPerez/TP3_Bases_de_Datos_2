        "BODY": "Baker International Corp treasurer Eric\nMattson said the company hoped to iron out snags in a proposed\nmerger with Hughes Tool Co <HT> but declined to say if or what\ncompromises might be acceptable to it.\n    The proposed merger that would create a 1.2 billion dlr\noilfield services company was thrown into limbo yesterday when\nHughes management, balking at the terms of a government consent\ndecree, offered a counter-proposal to Baker.\n    Earlier today, Hughes adjourned a shareholders meeting\ncalled to vote on the proposed merger until March 11 and said\nit hoped to resume negotitations with Baker.\n    Hughes chairman W.A. Kistler told reporters that Hughes did\nnot want to sign the Department of Justice consent decree until\nafter Baker's submersible pump and drilling bit operations were\nsold.\n    Mattson told Reuters that Baker still believed a merger was\npossible between the two giant oilfield service companies.\n    \"The company's position is we would like to see the merger\nbe completed, which is in the best interests of our\nshareholders and their shareholders,\" Mattson said.\n    \"Our goal is for a merger to occur. Because of the\nlitigation, I can't go any further than that,\" he said.\n    Baker filed a lawsuit in Texas state court late yesterday\nto force Hughes to abide by terms of the proposed consent\ndecree.\n    Mattson also declined to comment on whether the directors\nof Baker and Hughes have scheduled any meetings to discuss the\nmerger.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
