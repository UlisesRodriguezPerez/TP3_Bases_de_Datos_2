        "BODY": "Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita\nsaid the central bank will carefully consider its monetary\npolicy in light of the recent sharp fall of the dollar.\n    Asked if the Bank of Japan will consider a further cut in\nits discount rate, he said he now thinks the bank will have to\ncarefully consider its future money policy.\n    He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that\ncredit conditions have been eased by the five discount rate\ncuts by Japan since the beginning of last year.\n    Japan must now be especially careful about a flare-up in\ninflation, with money supply growth accelerating, he said.\n    Sumita said the central bank would continue to make a\njudgement on monetary policies while watching consumer prices,\nexchange rates and economic and financial conditions both in\nand outside Japan.\n    Asked if the September 1985 Plaza agreement was a failure\nbecause the dollar had fallen too far, Sumita said he still\nthought the pact was a good one in the sense that it had\ncorrected the overvaluation of the dollar. But the Plaza accord\ndid not set any target for the dollar's fall, he said.\n    The dollar's steep fall stems from the market's belief that\nthe trade imbalance will continue to expand, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
