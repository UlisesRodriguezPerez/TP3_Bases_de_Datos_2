        "BODY": "The Agriculture Department's\nwidening of Louisiana gulf differentials will affect county\nposted prices for number two yellow corn in ten states, a USDA\nofficial said.\n    All counties in Iowa will be affected, as will counties\nwhich use the gulf to price corn in Illinois, Indiana,\nTennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama\nand Louisiana, said Ron Burgess, Deputy Director of Commodity\nOperations Division for the USDA.\n    USDA last night notified the grain industry that effective\nimmediately, all gulf differentials used to price interior corn\nwould be widened on a sliding scale basis of four to eight cts,\ndepending on what the differential is.\n    USDA's action was taken to lower excessively high posted\ncounty prices for corn caused by high gulf prices.\n    \"We've been following this Louisiana gulf situation for a\nmonth, and we don't think it's going to get back in line in any\nnearby time,\" Burgess said.\n    Burgess said USDA will probably narrow back the gulf\ndifferentials when and if Gulf prices recede. \"If we're off the\nmark now because we're too high, wouldn't we be as much off the\nmark if we're too low?\" he said.\n    While forecasting more adjustments if Gulf prices fall,\nBurgess said no other changes in USDA's price system are being\nplanned right now.\n    \"We don't tinker. We don't make changes lightly, and we\ndon't make changes often,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
