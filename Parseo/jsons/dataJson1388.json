        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 3 - ",
        "BODY": "The European Community, EC, sold\n75,000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85\nand 89 dlrs per tonne FOB for March delivery in a continuing\nbid to establish itself in the Brazilian wheat market, the U.S.\nAgriculture Department said.\n    The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs per\ntonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latest\nreport on Export Markets for U.S grains.\n    EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during\n1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes in\nthe 1985/86 season, it said.\n    The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at a\ntime when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheat\nimport market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the current\nforecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year.\n    The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline in\ndomestic production, and says government plans to lower the\nguaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs\nwill contribute to greater import demand, the USDA said.\n    It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier of\nthe additional 400,000 tonnes, but commitments for purchase of\nU.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only\n600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
