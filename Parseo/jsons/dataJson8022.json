        "BODY": "Long Island Lighting Co said\nit revised its preliminary 1986 net income to include a 16 mln\ndlrs after tax provision for its investment in the Jamesport\nNuclear units.\n    Due to the provision, it said its revised 1986 net income\nwas 316.7 mln dlrs or 2.13 dlrs per share after deducting for\npreferred stock dividend requirements, which were not paid in\neither 1986 or 1985.\n    It had earlier reported 1986 income of 332.7 mln dlrs or\n2.28 dlrs per share.\n    LILCO also said its board authorized contracts for its \ncorporate officers calling for payment of one year's salary,\nand continuation of insurance and retirement benefits if the\ncompany changes hands and these officers lose their jobs.\n    LILCO said none of these contracts will result in\nadditional costs to its customers.\n    Lilco said the downward revision in its 1986 earnings is a\nreserve established to reflect a settlement agreement with the\nstaff of New York State's Public Service Commission respecting\nthe utility's spending on a nuclear power station planned for,\nbut never built at, Jamestown, N.Y.\n    The company declined to detail the settlement, explaining\nthe settlement has not been approved by the commission. Lilco\nwas seeking to include costs totaling 118 mln dlrs for the\nabandoned nuclear power plant project in its rate base, a\nspokeswoman said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
