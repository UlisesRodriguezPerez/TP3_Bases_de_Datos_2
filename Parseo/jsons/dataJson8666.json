        "BODY": "Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlr\npurchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc\nbrokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers\nare likely to follow, securities analysts said.\n    The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses\nis likely to pay off in dollars and international market\nposition, they said. \"It's part of a trend towards growing\ncapital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign\nfinancial institutions,\" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with\nKleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.\n    The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described\nby some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give\nNippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on\nWall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its\nassets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.\n    Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business\nsectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.\n    The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50\njoint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset\nmanagement, market research, and consulting on financing.\n    Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the\nworld's biggest institutional investor, analysts said.\n    The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the\ndeal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life\ninsurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.\n    The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese\ninsurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year.\nSince then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks\nand sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and\ninstruments.\n    Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was\nappointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's\nboard and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a\nlimited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.\n    Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and\nproblem-plagued banks in 1984. \"But now Japanese are going for\nblue-chip organisations,\" he said.\n    \"It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing\nindustries,\" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. \"With a\nhistorically high yen, and historically low interest rates,\nthere's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.\"\n    Competition in fund management has grown along with greater\nJapanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln\nyen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17\nto 18 pct, he said.\n    To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and\ngain experience with financial instruments which are likely to\nspread to Japan with further deregulation. \"The high regulatory\nenvironment has delayed (life insurance firms')\ndiversification. Now there's a growing number of new products\nin an environment of increasing competition for performance on\nfund management,\" Smithson said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
