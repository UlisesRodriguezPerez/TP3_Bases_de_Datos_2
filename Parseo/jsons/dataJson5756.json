        "DATELINE": "    LOS ANGELES, March 16 - ",
        "BODY": "Caesars World Inc said it filed a\nlawsuit against Martin T. Sosnoff and MTS Acquisition Corp\nregarding its March 9 unsolicited tender offer for Caesars\nWorld stock.\n    The company said it filed in the Federal Court in the\nCentral District of California, charging the tender offer,\nwhich its board rejected, violated federal securities laws and\nfederal margin regulations.\n    The suit charges the offering materials are materially\nfalse and misleading and misstate and conceal material\ninformation required to be disclosed to shareholders.\n    The suit also charges the offer is illusory and designed to\nmanipulate the market in Caesars World stock to enable Sosnoff\nto sell the Caesars World stock he already owns for a\nsubstantial profit.\n    The complaint seeks, among other things, to enjoin the\ntender offer and to require MTS and Sosnoff to correct false\nand misleading statements in the offer.\n    Caesars World is expected to seek a friendly suitor,\nrestructure operations, or buy back Sosnoff's holdings in an\nattempt to fight off the bid.\n    Sosnoff holds about 13.6 pct of the company's stock.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
