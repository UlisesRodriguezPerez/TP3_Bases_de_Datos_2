It would be nice if\nthe Saudis would go more public, but it's their real estate,\"\nsaid the official who asked not to be named.\n    He declined to describe what sort of help the Saudis were\nproviding, saying that Saudi officials are reluctant to\nacknowledge their role in the Gulf where the United States has\nstationed forces to protect shipping lanes.\n    The prince met Vice President George Bush on Monday after\nU.S. naval forces attacked offshore Iranian oil platforms in\nwhat Washington said was retaliation for an Iranian attack on a\nship moored off Kuwait and flying the U.S. flag.\n    Asked at the start of the meeting how he felt about the\nattack, the prince, who is here on an official visit, replied,\n\"I believe what the United States has done is their\nresponsibility as a superpower.\"\n    The senior U.S. official said his remark was an endorsement\nof the U.S. attack.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
