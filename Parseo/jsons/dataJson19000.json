        "DATELINE": "    PARIS, June 18 - ",
        "BODY": "Prospects for world economic growth remain\nvery sluggish, and coordinated action by western governments is\nurgently needed to restore business confidence, stabilize\ncurrencies and encourage investment, the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said here.\n    \"The economic situation has deteriorated in recent months,\nand ... Slow growth, high unemployment and large payments\nimbalances are likely to persist,\" it said in one of its\ngloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years.\n    The gross national product (GNP) of the 24-nation bloc of\nwestern industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only\n2.25 pct both this year and next, even slower than last year's\n2.5 pct growth rate.\n    \"We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD area\ncomfortably exceeding three pct,\" David Henderson, head of the\nOECD's economics and statistics department, said.\n    The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to rising\ninflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U.S.,\nCombining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world\ndebt problem to increase the risks of a world economic\ndownturn.\n    \"At the same time, many of the conditions for faster growth\nremain favorable,\" it said, citing low inflation in most major\ncountries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interest\nrates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexible\nlabor markets.\n    But private sector confidence had been undermined by\nuncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that \"for\nconfidence to be restored, it is important for governments\nswiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments.\"\n    This was a clear reference to last February's Louvre accord\nof the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said.\n    The OECD said that apparent disagreements among major\ncountries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped to\nundermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscal\npolicies from the U.S., West Germany and Japan to slow demand\nin the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries.\n    Henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announced\nrecently by the Japanese government to encourage public works\nand cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this\nprocess, though it was too early to estimate its precise\nimpact.\n    He said the measures will help strengthen Japan's domestic\ndemand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP.\n    The inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, has\nworsened in recent months, with OECD consumer prices forecast\nto rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pct\nincrease in 1986.\n    There is no prospect for any significant improvement in the\nunemployment situation over the next 18 months, with the\naverage rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to last\nyear.\n    The OECD called for efforts to liberalize world\nagricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away from\nprice guarantees and other measures linked to production\ntowards direct income support for farmers.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
