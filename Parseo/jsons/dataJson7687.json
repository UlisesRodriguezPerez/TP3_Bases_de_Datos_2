        "BODY": "Pubco Corp said its board declared a\ndividend distribution of one common stock purchase right on\neach outstanding share of Pubco's common stock.\n    It said each right will entitle shareholders to buy one\nshare of common stock at an exercise price of three dlrs.\n    The rights will be exercisable only if a person or group\nacquires 20 pct or more of Pubco's common stock or announces a\ntender which would result in ownership by a person or group of\n20 pct or more of the common stock, the company said.\n    Pubco said it will be entitled to redeem the rights at 0.1\ncts per right at any time before a 20 pct position has been\nacquired and afterward in certain circumstances. It said the\nexercise price will be substantially reduced in the event of an\nacquisition of 25 pct or more of common stock.\n    If Pubco is acquired in a merger or other transaction, each\nright will entitle its holder to purchase, at the right's\nthen-current exercise price, a number of the acquiring\ncompany's common shares having a market value at that time of\ntwice the right's exercise price, the company said.\n    The dividend distribution will be made March 31, 1987,\npayable to shareholders of record on that date. The rights will\nexpire ten years later on March 31, 1987, the company said.\n    Pubco said the rights are not being distributed in response\nto any specific effort to change control of Pubco, and the\nboard is not aware of any such effort.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
