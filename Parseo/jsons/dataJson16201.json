Growth was 2.4 pct in 1986.\n    Schmahl, presenting the report at a news conference, said,\n\"None of the institutes reckons with a recession or with the\nbeginning of a recession.\" He added, however, that exports\nremained the weak point of the economy .\n    Schmahl also said West Germany would have to expect further\nencroachments of foreign goods onto its markets.\n    Arthur Krumper of Munich's Ifo institute, which with the\nDIW of West Berlin had presented the more pessimistic view of\nthe economy, said, \"The braking effects (on the economy)\nproduced by external factors will remain considerable for most\nof the year.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003"
