        "BODY": "China's 1987 cotton output must rise\nabove the 1986 level of 3.54 mln tonnes or supply will fall\nshort of increasing demand, the China Daily said.\n    Demand in 1986 rose 10.9 pct over 1985.\n    Output in 1986 fell from 4.15 mln tonnes in 1985 and a\nrecord 6.2 mln in 1984, official figures show. The China Daily\nattributed the decline to several factors, including less\nfavorable weather conditions and new state measures to restrict\ncotton production after the 1984 build-up of stocks.\n    According to Customs figures, cotton exports rose to\n558,089 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 347,026 in 1985.\n    To increase output quickly, the state will raise by 10 pct\nthe price it pays for cotton produced above and beyond quota\nlevels, the newspaper said. Its official purchasing agencies\nwill buy cotton produced in excess of that originally\ncontracted for, it added.\n    The China Daily said all cotton growing areas in south\nChina should be maintained, and growing in the north should be\nconcentrated in Hebei, Shandong, Henan and Xinjiang.\n    It called for comprehensive planning to coordinate\nproduction of cotton with that of grain, edible oil and other\ncrops, but gave no more details.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
