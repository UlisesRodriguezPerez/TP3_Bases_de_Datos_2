        "BODY": "Treasury Secretary James\nBaker said any further decline in the dollar against other\ncurrencies would be counterproductive.\n    Baker was asked after a speech to the Pan American Economic\nLeadership Conference about U.S. policy in light of President\nReagan's comment last week at the Venice summit that he could\nsee some further decline in the dollar within reason.\n    \"All of the G-7 nations believe that any further decline in\nthe dollar would be counterproductive,\" Baker told reporters.\n    Following the Venice press conference by Reagan, the White\nHouse clarified Reagan's comments on the dollar by saying that\nthe United States wants a stable dollar.\n    The main incentive for the United States to favor a weaker\ndollar has been the need to reduce the massive trade deficit,\nbut the deficit has narrowed for the past two months and\nappears to be responding to the 40 pct drop in the dollar\nagainst the yen and the mark during the past two years.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
