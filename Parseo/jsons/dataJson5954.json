        "BODY": "Already strained relations between\nthe U.S. And the European Community (EC) are likely to get\nworse before they get better, director general of the Dutch\nEconomics Ministry's foreign affairs division Frans Engering\nsaid.\n    Speaking at an American Chamber of Commerce lunch in The\nHague, Engering noted the developing history of crises over\nsteel, citrus and pasta, and warned of more to come.\n    \"I consider the strident tone of US declarations on Airbus\nill-advised, and the EC fats and oils tax proposal a dangerous\nprovocation,\" he said. \"I feel that we shall probably have to\ndeal with quite a few more crises in the foreseeable future.\"\n    Not only is the US Congress clearly very determined to get\nthe American balance of payments into better shape, but the\nrisks of brinkmanship are all the greater because the EC has\nits own constraints in meeting outside pressure, Engering\nnoted.\n    \"If we ask ourselves whether it is perhaps inevitable that\nwe keep pushing each other to the brink of actual trade war,\nthen I think the answer is probably yes,\" he said.\n    In order to reduce these tensions, decision-making in the\nEC must become less self-centred, and the US Administration\nwill have to exercise the authority to convince Congress and\npressure groups of the need for accommodation, he added.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
