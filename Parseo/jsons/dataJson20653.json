        "BODY": "Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas\nlease sale number 97 in the Beaufort Sea, tentatively\nschedualed for January 1988 has been postponed, the U.S.\nDepartment of Interior said.\n    Alan Powers, chief of the Minerals Maanagement Service for\nthe department, said the delay is to have more time to study\nthe effects of drilling noise on whale migrations.\n    Powers said the state has asked for additional noise data\nfor the sale area off Alaska's North Slope. A new date has not\nbeen set, but it will likely be no sooner than next March,\nPowers said.\n    Some 3,930 blocks encompassing about 21 mln acres are\ninvolved in the proposed sale. The area is between three and\n160 miles off the northern coast of Alaska in the Artic Ocean\nbetween the Canadian border and 162 degrees west longitude.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
