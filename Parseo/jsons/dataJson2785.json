        "DATELINE": "    BOSTON, March 6 - ",
        "BODY": "The Pioneer Group Inc said its 70\npct-owned Teberebie Goldfields Ltd venture was granted an\nadditional concession of land in Ghana to seek and mine gold.\n    The State Gold Mining Corp of Ghana granted the venture an\nadditional 14.5 square kilometers in Teberebie, Ghana,\ncontiguous to 11.5 square kilometers granted earlier.\n    The original concession appears to have a substantial\namount of gold bearing material containing about 2 grams, or\n6/100 ounces, of gold per tonne. But the venture has no firm\nestimate on the costs of extracting the gold and no assurances\ncan be given that the reserves can be mined profitably, the\ncompany said. It said Teberebie Goldfields has not conducted\ntests on the newly granted land but added the land seems to be\nsimilar in geological characteristics to the original land.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
