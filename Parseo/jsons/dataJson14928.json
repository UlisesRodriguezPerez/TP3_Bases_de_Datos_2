        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, April 8 - ",
        "BODY": "Nickel prices are unlikely to rise\nsignificantly from current levels unless further steps are\ntaken to reduce production, Shearson Lehman Brothers said in\nits quarterly nickel market report.\n    The market had recovered slightly to around 1.72 dlrs a lb\nyesterday from its four year low of 1.55 dlrs in early January,\ndue to the absence of Soviet nickel cathode deliveries, but\nShearson sees Soviet shipments soon returning to last year's\nbuoyant levels, which should ease current tightness.\n    Output reductions by producers will take effect later this\nyear but are likely to be offset by increases elsewhere.\n    Shearson said the nickel market will be virtually in\nbalance during 1987, with total non-Socialist world demand at\n556,000 tonnes, compared with an estimated 544,000 tonnes in\n1986, production at 505,000 tonnes (504,000) and imports from\nSocialist countries at 47,000 tonnes (50,000).\n    It forecast prices will edge higher during the year from a\nfirst quarter average of 1.67 dlrs a lb up to 1.77 dlrs in the\nlast quarter. The year's average will be around 1.72 dlrs a lb\ncompared with 1.76 dlrs in 1986, using London Metal Exchange\ncash metal prices in dollar terms and assuming an average 1987\nsterling exchange rate of 1.55 dlrs.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
