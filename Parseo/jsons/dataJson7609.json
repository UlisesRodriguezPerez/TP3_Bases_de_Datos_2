        "BODY": "<Berliner Bank AG> has suffered\nlosses of between 10 and 100 mln marks through credits granted\nby its Stuttgart branch by officials there exceeding their\npowers, a bank spokesman said in answer to queries.\n    The spokesman declined to say exactly how large the losses\nwere. Berliner Bank has suspended the three managers of its\nStuttgart branch and is continuing an investigation into the\ncase, in which state prosecutors are also participating.\n    The fact that powers had been exceeded emerged in a routine\ncheck at the branch. The City of West Berlin owns 74 pct of\nBerliner Bank and the rest is held by small shareholders.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
