        "DATELINE": "    TOKYO, June 18 - ",
        "BODY": "Japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pct\nto 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln a\nyear earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.\n    The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand for\npoultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beef\ncattle raising, Ministry officials said.\n    Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87\nagainst 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were\n217,554 tonnes against 224,101.\n    Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnes\nfrom 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.\n    The officials said corn imports rose because the world\nsurplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reduced\nChicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in\n1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.\n    Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87\nfrom 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from\n18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices due\nto poor harvests last year in major producing nations such as\nArgentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.\n    Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln and\nthe compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.\n    The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted from\nincreased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.\n    Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against\n528,152 a year earlier. The compounding ratio rose to 2.2 pct\nfrom 2.1 pct.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
