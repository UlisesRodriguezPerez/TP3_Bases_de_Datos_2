        "BODY": "Carl Icahn's bold takeover bid for\nUSAir Group <U> has clouded the fate of Piedmont Aviation Inc,\nwhich was being courted by USAir.\n    Yesterday, Icahn's Transworld Airlines Inc <TWA> made a 1.4\nbillion dlr offer for USAir Group. The move complicated a USAir\ntakeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to\naccepting the bid.\n    Today, USAir rejected Icahn's 52 dlr per share offer and\nsaid the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its\ntakeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment.\n    Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA was\noff 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread\nit would be taken over.\n    Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt\nto either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a\nsuitor who might want both airlines once they merged.\n   \"The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or\nPiedmont and USAir announce a deal,\" speculated one arbitrager.\n    Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current\nprice of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir's bid will\nsucceed.\n    Piedmont's largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk\nSouthern Corp <NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the\ncompany. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of\nPiedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance.\n    Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of\nPiedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is\ndestined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the\nleast likely to be bought.\n    Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in\nthe airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a\nthree-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont.\n    But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn's\noffer, which lacked financing and was riddled with\ncontingencies.\n    Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two\nairlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA.\n    \"You can't discount him,\" said one arbitrager.\n    Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is\nserious by following through with his threats or making a new\noffer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go\ndirectly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower\nprice if USAir rejected his offer.\n    \"It's clear Icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing,\" said\none arbitrager.\n    Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by\nabout six dlrs per share.\n    Some analysts believe Icahn's proposed three-way airline\ncombination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but\nothers believe it could be cleared if the companies are\nacquired separately.\n    \"TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to\nwork,\" said one analyst.\n    Analysts said such a merger would be costly and\ncomplicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn\nsucceeded in winning concessions from its unions.\n    In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA's wage\nscale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity,\nanalysts said.\n    Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they\nsaid. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines'\ncosts when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a\nnecessary ingredient for a merger to work.\n    However, other analysts speculated the managements of\nPiedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new\ncompany. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way\nfor him to exit the company if USAir's airline is then merged\ninto TWA.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
