        "DATELINE": "    ROME, June 2 - ",
        "BODY": "Italy's barley crop is generally in good\ncondition and harvesting is expected to begin shortly, the\nagricultural marketing information and research board Irvam\nsaid.\n    First consignments were expected to be available around\nmid-June.\n    Excellent weather, characterised by alternating periods of\nsunshine and rain, has encouraged growth except in Sardinia,\nwhich was expected to lose a large part of its barley crop\nbecause of extreme dryness.\n    Irvam said yields are expected higher than last year's low\nlevels if favourable weather continues in the next few weeks.\n    Given an average yield of 3.5 tonnes per hectare, national\nproduction would be around two pct higher than in the previous\nseason at just above 1.6 mln tonnes, it said.\n    If yields reach the record 3.78 tonnes per hectare achieved\nin 1984, production would be around 1.75 mln tonnes, an\nincrease of 11 pct compared to 1986.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
