        "BODY": "American Telephone and Telegraph Co does\nnot plan to reduce its regular quarterly dividend of 30 cts a\nshare on its common stock, said James E. Olson, chairman.\n    \"It has been the intent to set the dividend at a level so\nthat it could be sustained through the ups and downs of the\nbusiness cycle,\" Olson told a meeting of securities analysts.\n    \"We see no reason to change that policy,\" he said.\n    Although ATT will maintain its current dividend, Olson said\nthe company wants to decrease the percentage of earnings paid\nin dividends by increasing earnings.\n    Industry analysts had speculated that ATT might cut its\ncommon dividend, especially after the company posted a fourth\nquarter net loss of 1.17 billion dlrs and earned only five cts\na share for the full year.\n    The loss included a one-time restructuring charge of 1.7\nbillion dlrs.\n    Olson said he expects ATT's cash flow to remain strong\ndespite the poor earnings.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
