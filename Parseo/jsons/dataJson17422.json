        "DATELINE": "    HOUSTON, April 29 - ",
        "BODY": "Coastal Corp and TransAmerican Natural\nGas Corp have proposed settling more than four billion dlrs in\nlawsuits with an agreement for natural gas sales and\ntransportation between the two Texas firms, a lawyer for\nCoastal said.\n    The proposed settlement also provided for Coastal to\nwithdraw its reorganization plan in TransAmerican's bankruptcy\nproceedings.\n    Thomas McDade, a lawyer for Coastal, said the settlement\nincluded a five-year agreement for TransAmerican to transport\nup to 100 mln cubic feet of natural gas daily from south Texas\nfields to major pipeline interchanges. TransAmerican will also\nsell Coastal up to 125 mln cubic feet of gas at spot market\nprices during the next 10 years.\n    McDade said Coastal would agree to support TransAmerican's\nplan of reorganization pending in federal bankruptcy court.\n    TransAmerican, a Houston-based natural gas production and\npipeline company, had sued Coastal for 4.1 billion dlrs\nalleging that Coastal chairman Oscar Wyatt wrongly interfered\nwith TransAmerican's reorganization efforts. Coastal is one of\nTransAmerican's unsecured creditors.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
