        "DATELINE": "    ZURICH, March 19 - ",
        "BODY": "Swissair <SWSZ.Z> reported a 5.8 pct\ndrop in 1986 net profit to 64.5 mln Swiss francs and said that,\nin line with its new, flexible dividend policy, it would cut\nits payout to 33 francs per share from 38.\n    President Robert Staubli told a news conference that the\nfirst two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit would\nat least equal last year's figure, but said much depended on\noutside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate.\n    The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss on\nSwissair's core flying business last year, against a profit of\n27 mln francs the previous year, he said.\n    The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68\nmln francs from plane sales, compared with a mere 17 mln francs\nin 1985. Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20\nmln francs from sales this year, although said much depended on\nthe speed with which it decided to sell its DC-10s.\n    Gross profit for 1986 reached 340.5 mln francs, with 276\nmln francs subtracted for ordinary depreciation.\n    Gross profits for the previous year had been 382.5 mln\nfrancs, with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation, including 45\nmln francs supplementary depreciation.\n    Staubli said the 1986 result, well below predictions made\nthis time last year, suffered considerably due to exchange rate\nfluctuations, in particular the strength of the Swiss franc.\n    While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop in\nthe dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuel\nprices, there was no such offset for the strength of the franc\nagainst other European currencies.\n    \"Income and profit generated by services to these countries\nshrank by a very substantial margin,\" he said. \"Exchange rate\ntrends therefore hit us much more severely than most other\nairlines.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
