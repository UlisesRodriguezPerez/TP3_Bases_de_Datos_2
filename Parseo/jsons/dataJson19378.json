        "BODY": "Reed International Plc <REED.L> denied\nrumours on the U.K. Stock market that it was the target of a\ntakeover bid and said it had received no approach.\n    \"In view of the increase in our share price today, I want to\nmake clear that we have not received any bid approaches,\" Reed's\nchairman Leslie Carpenter said in a statement.\n    Rumours that U.S. Publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc\n<HBJ> might bid for Reed, a paper and printing company, pushed\nReed shares up 54p at 600p at one stage today before they eased\nback to 564p at the close against a background of a widespread\ndecline in U.K. Equity prices.\n    Share market analysts said speculators were buying the\nstock on belief that Harcourt would bid for Reed in an effort\nto escape the unwelcome two billion dlr bid from Robert\nMaxwell's British Printing and Communication Corp <BPCL.L>.\n    Such a move would have made Harcourt too big for BPCC to\ntake it over, analysts added.\n    They also said there was some speculation that if BPCC's\nbid for Harcourt was unsuccessful, it could turn its attention\nto Reed.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
