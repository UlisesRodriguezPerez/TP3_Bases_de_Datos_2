        "BODY": "Britain and Australia have offered a\ntotal of 129,250 tonnes of wheat to Bangladesh as grants to\ncontain rising cereal prices and help support rural employment\nprojects, officials said.\n    They said 79,250 tonnes of wheat promised by Britain would\nbe shipped next week and used for the government's \"Food for\nWork\" program in the villages.\n    Under the program, workers building roads, digging\nirrigation canals and engaged in other rural development\nactivities get their daily wages in wheat instead of money.\n    The 50,000 tonnes of Australian wheat would arrive in\nBangladesh next month and be sold under open-market operations\ndesigned to stop price increases, the officials said.\n    Prices of rice and wheat have risen at least 15 pct in the\npast month, market sources said. But the government expects\nprices to fall after the wheat harvest next month.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
