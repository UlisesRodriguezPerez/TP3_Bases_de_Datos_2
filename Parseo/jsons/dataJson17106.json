        "BODY": "A range of substantial policy\ninitiatives need to be implemented to shift resources from\nconsumption to production in the Zimbabwe economy, says the\nZimbabwe Banking Corporation (ZBC) in its quarterly economic\nreview.\n    The state owned banking group says although Zimbabwe's\nbalance of payments improved significantly last year the\nunderlying position deteriorated. Last year's improved trade\nsurplus was partly the result of sales of stockpiled gold and\ncontinued import restraint.\n    It says debt service charges are projected to exceed 35 pct\nof exports in 1987 and warns against squeezing imports further.\n    ZBC says mining industry import quotas for the first six\nmonths of 1987 have been halved and those for manufacturing\nindustry cut by a third.\n    It contrasts the performance of manufacturing industry in\n1967 to 1974, with that since independence in 1980. Industrial\nproduction almost doubled between 1967 and 1974, when foreign\ncurrency allocations almost trebled in real terms.\n    Since 1980, import allocations have been cut 45 pct and the\nZimbabwe dollar has depreciated by more than 60 pct. As a\nresult the bank says the external purchasing power of foreign\ncurrency allocations is currently only 20 pct of its 1980\nlevels.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
