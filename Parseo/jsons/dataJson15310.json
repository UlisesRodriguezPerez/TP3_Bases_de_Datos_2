        "BODY": "The Federal Reserve will promote lower\ninterest rates this year to sustain world economic growth,\nFirst Boston Corp managing director Albert Wojnilower said.\n    As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line against\ninflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit without\nsubverting national U.S. economic policy.\n    \"On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and,\nbecause the trade deficit is not responding, the United States\ndecided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet their\ncommitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do its\npart by moving rates down,\" Wojnilower said in a report.\n    \"Justifiably not anticipating either a recession or\nseriously higher interest rates, securities market participants\nhave seen little to fear,\" Wojnilower said.\n    He said last week's \"hiccup\" in money and currency rates\nand bond and stock prices was probably caused by Japanese\nwindow dressing for March 31 end-of-fiscal-year accounts.\n    Wojnilower said the U.S. probably enjoyed above-average\neconomic growth in the first quarter. However, the pick-up\nseems to reflect an unsustainable pace of inventory building\nand the prospect for the full year is still for real gross\nnational product growth of about 2-1/2 pct, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
