        "BODY": "A White House-ordered report said \nthat growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000\ncould have potentially damaging implications for national\nsecurity.\n    The Energy Department study discusses several options to\ncurb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.\n    President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled\nout a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help\nthe depressed domestic oil industry.\n    Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that\n\"although we have made gains in energy security in the last six\nyears, this report shows that there is justification for\nnational concern both over declining competitiveness of our\ndomestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports.\"\n    The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S.\nconsumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.\n    Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign\noil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.\n    President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a\ndetermination that the country never again become captive to a\nforeign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and\nsharp prices increases of the 1970s.\n    The report said an import fee would raise prices and help\nmake it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new\noil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would\ndepress the nation's economy.\n reuter\n\u0003"
