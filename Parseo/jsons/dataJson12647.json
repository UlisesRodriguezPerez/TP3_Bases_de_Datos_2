        "BODY": "Duff and Phelps put the outstanding\nfixed income securities of of Standard Oil Co on its watch list\nfollowing the tentative offer by British Petroleum of North\nAmerica <BP> to buy the company.\n    Standard Oil's nearly three billion dlrs of long-term debt\nis currently rated DP-5 (high A) by the ratings agency.\n    British Petroleum currently owns about 55 pct of Standard\nOil's outstanding common stock and to acquire the remainder at\nthe tender offer price of 70 dlrs per share would cost 7.4\nbillion dlrs.\n    British Petroleum intends to fund two-thirds of that\npurchase with borrowed funds and the rest with cash.\n    The additional debt will raise the fixed obligation ratio\nof British Petroleum from under 30 pct to perhaps 45 pct and\nincrease its debt service requirements, Duff and Phelps said.\n    However, putting Standard Oil's debt on its watch list,\nwhich Duff and Phelps said had \"potentially negative\nimplications,\" may eventually result in an upgrade depending on\nhow British Petroleum restructures the company, Howard Mount of\nthe ratings agency said.\n    Mount said that acquiring Standard Oil's substantial cash\nflows and eliminating the annual dividend, which totaled 305\nmln dlrs to common shareholders in 1986, would help satisfy\nBritish Petroleum's higher debt service.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
