        "BODY": "Thailand's improving economy will likely\ncause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billion\ndlrs by end-1987 from a record of nearly 4.2 billion at\nend-February, private bankers said.\n    Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to\n3.95 billion at end-January from 3.03 billion a year earlier.\n    Nimit Nonthapanthawat, chief economist at the <Bangkok Bank\nLtd>, said Thailand's strong export performance, its relatively\nhigh interest rates, foreign participation in its stock market,\nand growing foreign investment, especially from Japan,\ncontributed to the projected sharp rise.\n    Thai exports rose 19.4 pct in 1986 and are expected to\nexpand another 15 pct this year, bankers said.\n    A U.S. Embassy report said last month Thailand could\nachieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987, up\nfrom a projection of 3.8 pct for 1986 and 3.7 pct in 1985.\n    Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at its\ncurrent pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stable\nthe five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached.\n    Thailand calculates foreign reserves to include gold,\nspecial drawing rights and convertible currencies. The target\nis equivalent to five-and-a-half months' worth of imports.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
