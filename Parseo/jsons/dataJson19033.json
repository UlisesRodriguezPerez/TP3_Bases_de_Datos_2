        "BODY": "U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz\nwarned members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations\n(ASEAN) they could no longer rely on increased exports to the\nU.S. For growth.\n    \"Given the importance of exports, particularly export\nmanufactures, to all of your countries, you are going to have\nto work hard to diversify your markets,\" he said.\n    \"While you may be able to maintain your current market share\nin the U.S., You clearly will not be able to look to the U.S.\nTo take major increases in your exports,\" he added.\n    Shultz told the foreign ministers of Brunei, Indonesia,\nMalaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand the U.S.\nWould cut its huge foreign trade deficit more rapidly than many\nnow believed.\n    He said ASEAN's looming trade problems would not\nnecessarily stem from protectionist legislation now being\ncontemplated by Congress, \"but simply because of the adjustments\nthe U.S. Economy will have to make in order to service our\nlarge and growing external debt.\"\n    Shultz said the U.S. Deficit had resulted not from falling\nexports but from higher imports that had fuelled world growth.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
