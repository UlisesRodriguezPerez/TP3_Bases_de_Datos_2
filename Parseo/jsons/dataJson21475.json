        "DATELINE": "    BAHRAIN, Oct 19 - ",
        "BODY": "Unidentified jets attacked three Iranian\noil rigs in the southern Gulf early on Monday, setting at least\none of them ablaze, regional shipping sources said.\n    Earlier today in Washington, U.S. Television networks had\nreported that American forces launched a retaliatory strike\nagainst Iran late Sunday, attacking two Iranian offshore oil\ndrilling platforms and setting them ablaze.\n    The shipping sources said Iran's Sassan, Rostam and Rakhsh\noffshore oilfields were attacked at 0700 local (0300 GMT) by a\nwave of jet fighter bombers. Smoke was seen spiralling up from\nthe Rostam field soon after.\n    At least one of the other two targets was also believed to\nbe ablaze, the sources said.\n    The Sassan and Rostam fields have been targets for Iraqi\nair strikes in the past, but Baghdad had not reported any\nsouthern Gulf missions prior to news of the latest attack.\n    Shipping and military sources in the region have said Iran\nused its southern Gulf rigs as bases to launch helicopter and\nlater speedboat attacks on neutral ships in the waterway.\n    U.S. Officials had been meeting on a response since Friday\nwhen an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a\nU.S.-flagged ship. President Reagan said on Sunday he had\nalready made a decision on the U.S. Response to Friday's Iran\nattack but would not say what the decision was.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
