        "BODY": "Hopes mounted for an agreement on cocoa\nbuffer stock rules at an International Cocoa Organization,\nICCO, council meeting which opened here today, delegates said.\n    Both producer and consumer ICCO members said after the\nopening session that prospects for an agreement on the cocoa\nmarket support mechanism were improving.\n    \"The chances are very good as of now of getting buffer stock\nrules by the end of next week,\" Ghanaian delegate and producer\nspokesman Mama Mohammed told journalists.\n    Consumer spokesman Peter Baron called the tone of the\nnegotiations \"optimistic and realistic.\"\n    The ICCO council failed to agree on buffer stock rules when\na new International Cocoa Agreement came into force in January,\nwith deep differences of opinion precluding serious discussions\non the matter at that time. The existing buffer stock of about\n100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen, with a funds balance of 250\nmln dlrs.\n    The ICCO made buffer stock rules negotiations a priority at\nthis semi-annual council meeting in order to stop the slide in\nworld cocoa prices.\n    Consumers and producers agreed yesterday on the principles\nas a basis for negotiations.\n    The council broke for lunch, and reconvenes at 1500 hrs. A\nworking group which has been meeting since Monday will tackle\nthe buffer stock rules issue again at 1600 hrs, when ICCO\nexecutive director Kobena Erbynn presents a fleshed-out version\nof a draft proposal he prepared earlier this week, delegates\nsaid.\n    Mohammed said delegates will have a much clearer indication\nof prospects for an accord after details of the rules are\nelaborated by Erbynn, and after producers and consumers meet\nseparately later today to examine the scheme.\n    The draft proposal included three principles: a limit to\nnon- member cocoa comprising the buffer stock, an offer system\nfor buying buffer stock cocoa, and price differentials to be\npaid for various cocoas making up the buffer stock, delegates\nsaid.\n    During the morning council session, the Ivory Coast\ndelegation gave \"an open minded statement\" that it is willing to\nwork out a buffer stock rules solution which could come into\neffect as soon as possible, Baron said.\n    Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon, chairman of\nthe ICCO council, was now expected to arrive in London Monday\nto attend the talks, Baron said. Vice chairman Sir Denis Henry\nof Grenada chaired the meeting in his place.\n    Soviet and East German delegates did not attend the council\nsession because of a conflicting International Sugar\nOrganization meeting today, but could arrive this afternoon,\ndelegates said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
