        "BODY": "Norway is expected to seek a compromise\nsolution to defuse a row between Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap\nA/S <STAT.OL> (Statoil) and Conoco Norge A/S over which firm\nwill operate the Heidrun oil field, government sources said.\n    The sources, who asked not to be named, said the government\nwill likely recommend that Conoco be allowed to continue as the\nfield's operator through the development phase, with Statoil\ntaking over only after production starts in the early 1990s.\n    Oil Minister Arne Oeien told Reuters the government had\ntoday discused the Heidrun matter but that no final decision\nhad been taken and several questions remained unresolved.\n    It was unlikely the government would announce its decision\non Heidrun operatorship until after Thursday's cabinet meeting\nand after discussing a proposed solution with both companies,\nthe sources added.\n    This spring Norway's state-owned oil company Statoil\nexercised an option in the Heidrun field exploration license\nthat, if approved by the government, would allow it to relieve\nConoco as Heidrun operator, a move sharply criticised by\nConoco.\n    Heidrun is often cited by the government and industry as\nthe most likely candidate for the first field development\nproject on the Haltenbanken exploration tract off central\nNorway.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
