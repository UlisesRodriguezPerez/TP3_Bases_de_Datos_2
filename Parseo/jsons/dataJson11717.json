        "TITLE": "PACIFIC GAS <PCG> ACCOUNTING CHANGE TO CUT NET",
        "DATELINE": "    SAN FRANCISCO, March 31 - ",
        "BODY": "Pacific Gas and Electric Co said\nit expects to record a 470 mln dlr, or 1.25 dlr per share,\nreduction in 1987 earnings because of the company's decision to\nchange the method used to record Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power\nPlant revenues.\n    The accounting change will not affect the company's cash\nposition and the company intends to continue paying its\ndividend at the annual rate of 1.92 dlrs per share.\n    Last year Pacific Gas reported earnings of 925 mln dlrs, or\n2.60 dlrs per share.\n    Pacific Gas said the accounting change was prompted by\ndelays in the receipt of a California Public Utilities\nCommission decision on the company's 1984 application for rate\nrelief to recover the 5.8 billion dlr cost of constructing\nunits one and two of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Project.\n    It said the commission is currently allowing the company to\nrecover 40 pct of the cost of owning and operating the plants.\n    As a result, 63 mln dlrs has been accumulating each month\nas deferred non-cash account receivable, which has been\nincluded in current income.\n    But the accounting change, effective January 1, will\nreflect only cash received through interim rates approved by\nthe commission, Pacific Gas and Electric said.\n    It also said the commission is now awaiting its Public\nStaff Division's report which will recommend how much of the\n5.8 billion dlr investment Pacific Gas should be allowed to\nrecover in rates.\n    The company further stated that it is confident it will\nreceive an objective review of the facts.\n    It also said it intends to seek additional interim rates.\n    Pacific Gas began construction of the two nuclear power\nunits in 1969. After a number of construction delays, unit one\nwent into operation in May 1985 and unit two went on line in\nMarch last year.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
