        "BODY": "General Public Utilities Corp\nsaid the water-clarity problem delaying the removal of fuel\nfrom the damaged Unit Two of the Three Mile Island nuclear\npower plant appears to have been resolved.\n    The company said the slower than expected removal of the\nfuel, which has been primarily due to the water-clarity\nproblems, is now expected to extend fuel removal into 1988.\n    A spokesman said the company had previously expected this\nto be completed by the end of 1987 and has not estimated how\nfar into 1988 the process will extend. It still expects to\ncomplete the entire clean-up by the end of 1988, he added.\n    GPU said its auditors, Coopers and Lybrand, again qualified\nits opinion of GPU's financial statements, adding the recovery\nof TMI-2 decommissioning costs to the unresolved issues leading\nto the qualified opinion.\n    GPU said its operating subsidiaries will seek to recover\nthe costs of decommissioning TMI-2 in future rate proceedings.\n    As in past years, the qualified opinion continues to list\nother uncertainties associated with the accident, which damaged\nTMI-2 -- the recovery of cleanup costs and any payments for\ndamages that might exceed available insurance proceeds.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
