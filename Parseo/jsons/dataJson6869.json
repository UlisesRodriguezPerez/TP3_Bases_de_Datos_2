        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, March 18 - ",
        "BODY": "The British Conservative government said\nit would sell off its remaining 31.7 pct shareholding in\nBritish Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L> during the next financial year\nwhich starts on April 1.\n    Treasury Financial Secretary Norman Lamont made the\nannouncement to Parliament. He said, \"The government's policy is\nto sell its minority holdings in companies as and when\ncircumstances permit.\n    \"As part of this policy I am now able to announce that,\nsubject to market conditions, the government will sell its\nremaining shares in BP during the 1987/88 financial year.\"\n    The last sale of British government shares in BP was in\nSeptember 1983. The government currently holds some 578.5 mln\nordinary shares in the company.\n    Lamont said the Treasury would appoint financial advisers\nfor the sale. Merchant banks and stockbrokers interested in\nbeing considered for this would be interviewed in early April.\n    In September 1983, the U.K. Government sold 150 mln shares\nin an underwritten offer for sale by tender. The striking price\nthen was 435 pence - 7.5 pct above the minimum tender price, a\nTreasury spokesman said.\n    He said the sale of BP shares would not cut across the\ngovernment's plans to privatise Rolls-Royce, in either April or\nMay, or the sale of BAA Plc, the British airports authority\nwhich is slated for privatisation in either June or July.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
