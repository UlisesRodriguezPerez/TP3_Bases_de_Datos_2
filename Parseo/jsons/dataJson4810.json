        "BODY": "General Mills Inc, reporting\nstronger results for the third quarter ended February 22, said\nit expects the momentum to continue in the fourth quarter.\n    The company said it expects to report \"strong earnings per\nshare growth and a record return on equity in fiscal 1987.\" It\nsaid this should be achieved despite expected non-operating\ncharges in the final quarter.\n    General Mills said these charges will likely offset\nnon-operating gains, which included six cts a share in the\nfirst half.\n    General Mills said at the end of the third quarter, its\nreturn on average equity was 31.6 pct.\n    It said major factors contributing to the third quarter\nimprovement were an 11 pct gain in unit volume by Consumer\nFoods, continuing good profit growth at Red Lobster USA and\nstrong performance in Specialty Retailing.\n    The company reported quarterly earnings of 56.9 mln dlrs,\nor 64 cts a share, up from 46.4 mln dlrs, or 52 cts a share a\nyear ago. Sales rose to 1.31 billion dlrs from 1.13 billion\ndlrs. Year-ago data reflect a two-for-one common stock split.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
