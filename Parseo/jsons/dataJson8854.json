It said there is\nsignificant potential for the discovery of additional ore.\n    Hecla said initial production from a trackless underground\nmine is scheduled for late 1988 at a rate of about 1,000 tons\nor ore per day.  \"At this rate, the Greens Creek mine will be\nthe largest domestic silver mine and is expected to be one of\nthe lowest cost producers.\"\n    The company said it estimates its total investment in the\nproject, including its share of preproduction costs, at about\n45 mln dlrs, to be funded through internally generated cash and\nexisting lines of credit.  It said Amselco will retain a\nmajority interest in the project.  Other interest holders are\nCSX Corp <CSX> and <Exaias Resources Corp>.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
