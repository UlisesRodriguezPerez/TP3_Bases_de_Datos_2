        "BODY": "Shares in Cable and Wireless Plc\n<CAWL.L> firmed in morning trading on market speculation that\nits participation in a joint telecommunications venture in\nJapan would not be curtailed, dealers said.\n    The company's shares were quoted at 372p at 0915 GMT\ncompared with 364p last night.\n    The dealers said the speculation appeared to originate in\nJapan. Cable has said it is resisting attempts by the\nFederation of Economic Organisations to merge two Japan-based\ntelecommunications firms, a move which would have cut Cable's\nstake from 20 pct in one to three pct in the merged unit.\n    However, the dealers were uncertain exactly how the dispute\nover the shareholdings had been resolved.\n    British prime minister MargaretThatcher said in parliament\nlast week that she regarded Cable and Wireless's participation\nin the Japanese venture as a test case of how open the Japanese\ntelecommunications market really was.\n    A spokesman for Cable said he was unaware if the\nspeculation had any foundation. Cable itself had issued no\nstatement today on the issue.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
