        "BODY": "The Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd\n<RGFJ.S> (RGC) Mt Lyell copper mine in Tasmania will stay open\nfor an extra five years following a new aid package from the\nstate government, RGC said in a statement.\n    The mine had been scheduled to close in 1989 after the 40\nseries stopes were mined, but will now stay open until the\ndeeper 50 and 60 series have played out, probably in 1994.\n    The Australian dollar's fall since 1985 also improved the\nlocal dollar copper price, making the company profitable and\njustifying the mining of deeper reserves at a copper grade of\nabout 1.95 pct against about 1.60 pct now, the firm said.\n    Ore output will be cut, but the higher grades will keep\ncontained-copper output at current levels of about 24,000\ntonnes a year, it said. Capital expenditure of about 18 mln\ndlrs will be required over the life of the new plan, RGC said.\n    The latest aid package is the third since 1977 for RGC, a\nmajor employer in Queenstown on the thinly populated west coast\nof Tasmania.\n    The mine was kept open in 1985 after Tasmania gave RGC 10\nmln dlrs in aid. The new package includes an eight mln dlr\nadvance to RGC at the long-term bond rate, power concessions\nand deferred royalties and payroll taxes.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
