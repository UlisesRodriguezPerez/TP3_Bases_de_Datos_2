        "TITLE": "MORGAN GRENFELL SAYS 1986 PROFITS HIT BY GUINNESS",
        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, March 18 - ",
        "BODY": "<Morgan Grenfell Group Plc> said its\n1986 pre-tax profits were lower than forecast because of\ndepreciation in the value of its Guinness Plc <GUIN.L> shares\nand because of securities trading losses in the U.S.\n    Morgan chairman Lord Catto said the losses on the group's\nseven mln Guinness shares in addition to a 3.5 mln dlr loss on\nits risk arbitrage operation in New York depressed profits some\neight mln stg to 82.2 mln.\n    He also told a news conference Morgan had received informal\napproaches about a takeover of the group but was not\ninterested. No formal offers had been made, but Catto would not\nelaborate.\n    Morgan Grenfell acted as merchant banker to Guinness during\nthe brewing company's successful bid for Distillers Co Plc\n<DIST.L> in the first half of last year.\n    The U.K. Government launched an investigation into the\naffairs of Guinness last December. Public concern has focused\non the way Guinness may have breached U.K. Company law and the\nTakeover Code by prompting others to support its share price\nduring the bid.\n    Morgan chief executive Christopher Reeves, head of\ncorporate finance Graham Walsh and senior corporate finance\ndirector Roger Seelig all resigned in January over the Guinness\naffair.\n    Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive, Geoffrey Collier,\nresigned late last year on allegations of trading on insider\ninformation. He currently faces criminal charges.\n    Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been \"one of the\nmost traumatic in our history,\" but that clients and staff had\nbeen supportive.\n    \"I certainly look on the future in a positive way. We have\nthe worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet.\"\n    Profits for the year, up 19.4 pct from 1985 pre-tax profits\nof 68.8 mln stg, were mainly due to a high contribution from\ncorporate finance activities and progress in asset management.\n    Finance Director David Ewart told the news conference the\nperformance of the group so far in 1987 was \"within reasonable\ntouch of the budget.\"\n    Lord Catto also said the group was actively seeking a new\nchief executive to replace Sir Peter Carey, who is acting as\ninterim director after Reeves' resignation, and hopes to have a\nnew chief executive within a few months.\n    He also said Reeves and Walsh had been paid a total of\n562,000 stg in compensation following their resignations, but\ndeclined to say how much each man got. Negotiations were going\non to determine an amount of compensation for Seelig, he said.\n    Morgan Grenfell shares stood at a late 366p, 9p down on\nyesterday's 375p.\n REUTER...\n\u0003"
