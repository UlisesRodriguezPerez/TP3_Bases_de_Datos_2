Aluminum exports,\nmeanwhile, decreased nine pct in the same period, to 1,511\ntonnes from 1,647 tonnes.\n    Suralco's alumina refinery at Paranam, 18 miles south of\nthe capital, was shut down February 2 after workers destroyed\nplant and computer equipment in a protest over layoffs at the\ncompany's nearby aluminum smelter.\n    The smelter was shut down January 26 after anti-government\nguerrillas dynamited two electricity towers which transmit\npower to the plant from the Afobaka dam.\n    The alumina refinery, owned jointly by Suralco and Billiton\nNV, a Royal Dutch Shell subsidiary, was reopened March 9. But\nthe smelter remains closed, as do the Suralco mines at Moengo,\n60 miles east of Paramaribo, which were closed down by\nguerrillas last November.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
