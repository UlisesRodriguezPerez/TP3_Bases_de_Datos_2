        "BODY": "Demand for platinum could reach 3.4 mln\nounces by 1991, compared with an estimated offtake of 2.88 mln\nin 1986, Chris Clark, platinum marketing director for Johnson\nMatthey Plc said.\n    Clark told a meeting of the Minerals Research Organisation\nin Milton Keynes he foresaw a 250,000 ounce increase in\nconsumption for use in autocatalysts, currently the largest\nsingle application for platinum.\n    Jewellery consumption is set to rise by 70,000 ounces,\nClark predicted in his speech, the text of which was released\nin London today.\n    Clark said his forecast allowed for only a modest further\nincrease in investment buying and may well be cautious.\n    He said South Africa was the most likely source of\nadditional supplies and will need to increase output by about\n500,000 ounces to meet increased demand.\n    The capital investment required to produce the additional\noutput would be around one billion U.S. Dlrs and the political\nclimate may make it difficult to raise the money, he said.\n    The Soviet Union, whose exports have declined since the\n1970s, might increase sales to the West by about 50,000 ounces,\nClark said.\n    \"The very probability of a growth in demand set against the\nmassive investment required for expansion - and that expansion\nonly being viable in South Africa or Russia - leads me to\nconclude that the price of platinum will be substantially\nunderpinned in the medium to long-term,\" Clark said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
