        "BODY": "Senate Banking Committee chairman\nWilliam Proxmire called for curbs of hostile corporate\ntakeovers and new restrictions on risk arbitrageurs.\n    \"At the very least, it is high time that we require all risk\narbitrageurs to register seperately and specifically  with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and that we consider\nprecluding brokerage firms and their employers from investing\nin, or owning any securities issued by, third party risk\narbitrage operations,\" Proxmire said at the start of a hearing\non corporate takeovers.\n    \"A burning issue must be whether there ought to be a\ncomplete seperation in the future of risk arbitrage and\ninvestment banking,\" Proxmire said.\n    He said he was concerned that hostile takeover attempts\nwere hurting the economy, a view shared by corporate executives\nwho tesitified at the hearing. \"I believe that takeovers have\nbecome so abusive and so tilted in favor of the financial\nbuccaneers that remedial action is required,\" USX Corp chairman\nDavid Roderick said. \"For Congress to allow the takeover game to\ncontinue unchecked, would be economic suicide,\" Champion\nInternational Corp chairman Andrew Sigler added.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
