        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, March 31 - ",
        "BODY": "London and Scottish Marine Oil Plc\n(Lasmo) <LASL.L> will have an advantage when oil prices rise\nagain and it is confident this will happen early in the next\ndecade, the company said in a statement accompanying results.\n    Lasmo said its advantage comes from its reserves of oil and\ngas which at the end of 1986 stood at 210 mln barrels of oil\nequivalent, a group record. Reserves have increased every year\nsince 1983 at a compounded rate of 10 pct a year.\n    The company reported a 1986 pretax profit of 4.4 mln stg,\ndown from 118 mln in 1985.\n    It said falling oil prices caused the downturn.\n    The company said it reacted swiftly to the sharp drop in\noil prices which began over a year ago. Capital expenditure,\nwhich had been budgeted at over 150 mln stg, was cut to 51 mln\nstg net of disposals. Managers responded well to the demand for\nlower operating costs and this has been achieved worldwide.\n    The company said had very few exploration wells committed\nfor 1987 and therefore retains maximum flexibility in its\nexploration program. Even without further success, the existing\nfields and recent discoveries will contribute significantly to\nprofit and cash flow for some years to come, it said.\n    Lasmo shares were down 2p at 251 after the announcement.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
