        "BODY": "mexico's proven reserves of liquid\nhydrocarbons at end-1986 were 70 billion barrels, slightly down\nfrom 70.9 billion a year ago and 71.75 billion in 1984, the\nstate oil company petroleos mexicanos (pemex) announced.\n    Reserves were just 5.77 billion barrels in 1974, rose\nsharply to 40.19 billion in 1978 and flattened out at 72\nbillion in both 1981 and 1982.\n    In its annual report, pemex said average crude output in\n1986 was 2.43 mln barrels per day, 202,000 bpd down on 1985.\nAverage exports were 1.29 mln bpd, down from 1.44 mln bpd.\n    The company did not say what percentage of hydrocarbons was\ncrude oil, but has previouly said it was about 48 pct.\n    Natural gas output in 1986 was 3.43 billion cubic feet per\nday, down from 3.6 billion in 1985.\n    Due mainly to the fall in oil prices to around 12 dlrs from\n25 dlrs in the year, 58 wells, both exploratory and production,\nwere suspended, 38 of them in less productive areas than the\noffshore campeche fields which accounted for 64 pct of\nproduction.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
