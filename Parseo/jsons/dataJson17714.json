        "TITLE": "LITTLE REACTION TO REMOVAL COMEX DAILY LIMITS",
        "DATELINE": "    New York, June 1 - ",
        "BODY": "The elimination of limits on daily price\nfluctuations for metals futures contracts traded on the\nCommodity Exchange, COMEX, appears to be having little effect\non the market, analysts said.\n    \"There is nothing apparent from the change,\" said William\nO'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc.\n    \"The market has not approached the old price limits and\ntrading is relative quiet, in narrow ranges,\" he said.\n    On May 5, COMEX eliminated price limits on the two\ncontracts following each spot delivery in gold, silver, copper\nand aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations,\nwhich were severely tested by a volatile market in silver\nfutures at the end of April. COMEX announced Friday the lifting\nof all daily limits, effective today.\n    Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs per\nounce in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in the\nnearby contracts amid thin volume conditions, traders said.\n    Silver futures, previously limited at 50 cents in most back\nmonths, were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby\ncontracts amid quiet trading today.\n    During the last week of April, silver futures often traded\nat the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation, the\ndollar, and other factors. Traders rushed into the spot, or\nunlimited, contract to offset those moves, analysts said.\n    As a result, O'Neill said, there was much confusion, many\nunmatched trades, and large losses for some traders.\n    The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100,000 dlrs\nfor failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner.\n    Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,\nsaid the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic\nbuying or selling and contribute to more orderly markets.\n    O'Neill added that the elimination of daily limits would\nadd caution to trading.\n    \"This is a more realistic approach because the metals\nmarket is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,\"\nO'Neill said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
