        "BODY": "USAir Group said it sought the help\nof the U.S. Department of Transportation in its takeover fight\nwith Trans World Airlines Inc, asking the Department to order\nTWA to sell its USAir shares.\n    \"What they have done is in direct violation of the Federal\nAviation Act,\" USAir said.\n    It said TWA week filed a cursory application with the\nDepartment of Transportation for approval of its proposed 1.65\nbillion dlr takeover of USAir.\n    USAir rejected the offer and said it asked the Department\nof Transportation to dismiss the application.\n    USAir said it requested the dismissal because TWA avoided\npre-merger notification requirements, and also did not provide\na competitive and public interest analysis required under\nregulations.\n    USAir said if the application is dismissed, TWA would be\nlimited to buying only 1.5 pct of its 31.7 mln outstanding\nshares. If the application is approved, TWA could buy up to 10\npct, it said. TWA has said it owns less than 10 pct of USAir's\nstock.\n    TWA today revealed that it has increased its holdings to\nmore than four mln USAir shares, 15 pct of the outstanding.\n    TWA vice president general counsel Mark Buckstein said the\ncompany had made appropriate filings with the DOT and was in\ncompliance with the law.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
