        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, April 2 - ",
        "BODY": "U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard\nLyng warned Japan that the failure to remove a longstanding \nimport quota on Japanese beef might spark a protectionist\nresponse in the United States.\n    \"Given the protectionist mood in the Congress and the\ncountry, if I were a leader in Japan I would certainly be very\nconcerned...and the failure to remove it (the beef quota) might\nbe very serious,\" Lyng told a group of U.S cattlemen.\n    Lyng said he and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter,\nduring a visit to Japan later this month, will demand \"total\nelimination\" of the beef import quota by April 1988.\n    The current dispute with Japan over semiconductor may\nstrengthen the U.S. stance in farm trade negotiations, Lyng\nsaid, because Japan does not want a trade war with the U.S.\n    Lyng dismissed recent statements in Tokyo that Japan might\nretaliate against U.S. products as a result of the\nsemiconductor dispute.\n    \"They (Japan) aren't going to pick a fight with us,\" Lyng\nsaid, adding that with its huge bilateral trade surplus Japan\nhas more to lose in a trade war than the United States.\n    Lyng told the U.S. cattlemen that the quota on Japanese\nbeef imports does not allow consumers there an adequate choice\nin food purchases.\n    He said in addition to beef, the U.S. will press for\neliminiation of import barriers on Japan's citrus and rice as\nwell.\n    Lyng noted that Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. farm\nproducts, principally grains and soybeans.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
