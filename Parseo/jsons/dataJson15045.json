The figure for\nwomen was 256,500 at end-March against 256,100 a month earlier\nand 259,400 at end-March 1986.\n    On an unadjusted basis total unemployment fell by 16,500 in\nthe month to end-March to 692,200. In March 1986 the figure was\n725,000.\n    A ministry spokesman said the unadjusted figures showed a\nsmaller than usual seasonal decrease for the time of year,\nbecause of particularly cold weather delaying work in the\nbuilding industry. He said this explained the increase in the\nadjusted statistics.\n    Total vacancies available rose by 1,900 to 26,300 at\nend-March. A year earlier the figure was 28,763.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
