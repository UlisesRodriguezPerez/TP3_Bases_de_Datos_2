        "BODY": "Colombia's coffee export registrations\nremain open and there are no plans to close them since a new\nmarketing policy means an unlimited amount can be registered,\nGilberto Arango, president of the private exporters'\nassociation said.\n    \"The philosophy of the new policy is not to close\nregistrations. Nobody so far said may would be closed,\" he told\nReuters.\n    On March 13, Colombia opened registrations for April and\nMay for an unlimited amount.\n    Without giving breakdowns, Arango said private exporters\nhad registered 1,322,804 bags this calendar year up to April 6,\nor roughly 440,000 bags per month, slightly lower than the\naverage in recent years.\n    He estimated the amount of bags registered by the national\ncoffee growers' federation at about the same, meaning a total\nof about 900,000 bags registered and sold per month by\nColombia.\n    \"The only change that could happen is, because of the\nvolume, we would be told that from such a date, registrations\nwould be for June shipment, etc\" Arango said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
