        "BODY": "Taiwan imposed currency controls today\nin what bankers called a desperate move to prevent speculation\nas the Taiwan dollar appreciated against the U.S. currency.\n    The strict controls will require proof that large\nremittances to Taiwan are connected to commercial transactions\nrather than currency speculation.\n    Bankers attacked the controls as ineffective, saying they\nwere a panic reaction to pressure from Washington for faster\nappreciation of the Taiwan currency against the U.S. dollar,\nwhich would slow exports to the United States.\n    Remittances exceeding one mln dlrs earned through exports,\nshipping, insurance or bank lending will now need government\napproval, along with remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from\nany other source.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
