        "BODY": "The Soviet Union has been a heavy\nbuyer of Yugoslav corn since October, purchasing close to 1.5\nmln tonnes in the 1986/87 marketing year, according to a report\nfrom the U.S. agriculture counselor in Belgrade.\n    Approximately 1.5 mln tonnes of Yugoslav corn have already\nbeen committed to foreign buyers for 1986/87, with most of this\nsold to the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav Grain Association\nreported to the U.S. official.\n    In a report dated March 10, the official said that about\n800,000 tonnes of the corn has been delivered, with the balance\nof 700,000 tonnes to be shipped between now and June.\n    An additional 500,000 tonnes of corn can be shipped from\nJuly-September, the grain associaiton said, so total Yugoslav\ncorn exports could reach 2.0 mln tonnes, the counselor said.\n    Heavier than normal monthly shipping rates for Yugoslav\ncorn exports are due to the increased use of river barges for\nexporting corn to the Soviet Union, the counselor said.\n    Monthly corn shipments out of Yugoslavia have averaged\naround 160,000 tonnes since October 1, higher than earlier\nestimates of 150,000, the official said.\n    The Soviet Union has taken an increased share of Yugoslav\ncorn sales during this marketing year, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
