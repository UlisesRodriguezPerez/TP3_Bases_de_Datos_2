        "DATELINE": "    LIMA, April 3 - ",
        "BODY": "President Alan Garcia said he sought to\ndeepen Peru's hard-line foreign debt stance, possibly by\nlimiting repayments to the World Bank.\n    In a televised address tonight, he criticised the World\nBank for making Peru make larger debt payments than the amount\nthe bank is willing to make in new loans. \"We will deepen our\npolicy on the foreign debt,\" he said.\n    Peru has limited foreign debt repayments to 10 pct of\nexport earnings, effectively suspending most remittances due\nforeign private banks and many governments. It has generally\nbeen current for most of Garcia's 20 months in office on\npayments to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development\nBank.\n    But tonight Garcia said: \"We have met our aim of limiting\nthe payment of the debt and will limit it also even though\norganisations like the World Bank have credits which oblige us\nto buy a certain type of machinery and to build certain types\nof public works and not others, and to pay much more in dollars\nthan that which they are willing to newly lend us.\"\n    The Economy Ministry said last year it owed the World Bank\nabout 520 mln dlrs in loans out of the country's 14 billion dlr\ndebt.\n    Garcia said his government had been a model for Latin\nAmerica because Peru had enjoyed growth in gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) last year of nine pct while taking its hard line\non debt. He said GDP would grow by at least six pct this year.\n    He announced an immediate 40 pct rise in the minimum wage\nto 1,260 intis per month, benefiting the 1.3 mln minimum-wage\nworkers out of a total labour force of 6.7 mln.\n    Salaries will go up this month by 30 pct for civil servants\nand 27 pct for those workers earning above the minimum wage but\nnot covered by collective bargaining agreements.\n    He also said the price of petrol, frozen since August 1,\n1985, would increase by 20 pct from the current 17.5 intis per\nU.S. Gallon and remain at the new level for the rest of the\nyear. He did not say when this increase would be effective.\n    Taxes on petrol are the government's leading revenue\nearner, traditionally accounting for about one-third of taxes.\nSales taxes on autos, liquour and cigarettes would also go up,\nhe said, without specifying the amount.\n    Garcia announced the government would encourage Peruvians\nto repatriate their savings deposited abroad by paying a 15 pct\npremium above the market exchange rate.\n    The inti's official buy-sell rate against the dollar is\n14.85/92 and the free rate is about 21.70/80.\n    To encourage private investment, he said the government\nwould set up a special fund with which it would match every two\nintis of private investment with one inti from the government.\n    He also said his dismissal of Peruvian Air Force Commander\nLieutenant General Luis Abram Cavarellino yesterday\nstrengthened the democratic authority of his government.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
