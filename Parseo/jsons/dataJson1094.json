        "BODY": "There was no evidence of winterkill\nin Yugoslavian winter wheat during field travel along a line\nrunning northwest from Belgrade to near Maribor, the U.S.\nAgriculture Department's counselor in Belgrade said in a field\nreport.\n    The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence of\ndelayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fall\nbecause of dry conditions.\n    However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have\npromoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on\nlast fall's late seeding, it said.\n    Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the\nsituation because warm temperatures have brought the grain out\nof dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, the\nreport said.\n    Cold temperatures over the next month could cause damage\nunder these conditions, they said.\n    The report said all wheat farmers contacted during the\nfield trip were optimistic about the crop and the way it\nemerged from winter.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
