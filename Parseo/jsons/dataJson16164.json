        "BODY": "The price index for sales of\nmanufactured goods in the U.K. Rose a provisional, unadjusted\n0.3 pct in March after an identical rise in February,\nDepartment of Trade and Industry figures show.\n    The index for materials and fuel purchased by manufacturing\nindustry fell a provisional and unadjusted 1.1 pct after a 1.7\npct fall in February.\n    The Department said the year-on-year rise in producer\nprices in March was a provisional 3.7 pct, compared with a\nprovisional 4.2 pct increase in the year to end-February.\n    The index for output prices, non-seasonally adjusted, was\nput at a provisional 149.7 in March after 149.3 in February.\n    The index for input prices, also not seasonally adjusted,\nwas set at 128.2 in March after February's 129.6.\n    The 1.1 pct fall in input prices between February and March\nwas mainly due to a seasonal fall in industrial electricity\ncosts and lower scheduled prices for petroleum products, the\nDepartment said.\n    The Department said these falls were only partly offset by\na rise in prices of home-produced food manufacturing materials.\n    The seasonally adjusted index for input prices showed a 0.2\npct rise between February and March.\n    Year-on-year, the input price index was down 0.7 pct in\nMarch after a 2.8 pct drop in February.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
