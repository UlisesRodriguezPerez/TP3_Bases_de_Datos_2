        "BODY": "Ghana has lifted a ban on rice and maize\nimports due to crop problems caused by unusually dry weather,\nthe official Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported today.\n    Secretary for Finance and Economic Planning Kwesi Botchwey\nmade the announcement last night while accepting 7,891 tonnes\nof rice worth about four mln dlrs under a Japanese food aid\nprogramme.\n    The lifting of the ban, imposed earlier this year, follows\ngovernment concern over \"lower than average rainfall in southern\nGhana and its implications for the major harvest.\"\n    Botchwey said rain has been lacking in major cereal growing\nareas throughout the south this year. The Ministry of\nAgriculture has predicted a fall of at least 25 pct in all\nmajor staple crops including maize, rice and cassava.\n    GNA quoted Botchwey as saying that while the consequences\nof current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the drought\nexperiences of 1982/83 the government has taken steps to\nalleviate anticipated food production shortfalls.\n    The failure of seasonal rains has already seriously\naffected drinking water supplies, farming and fishing in parts\nof the Central and Volta regions of Ghana where rivers have\ndried up.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
