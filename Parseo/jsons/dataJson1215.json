        "BODY": "Soviet imports of soymeal may reach or\nexceed one mln tonnes between January and September this year,\nthe Oil World newsletter said.\n    Oil World said it was likely the Soviet Union would reduce\nsoybean imports and step up significantly its imports of meal.\n    At least 500,000 tonnes of soymeal may be shipped from the\nEuropean Community and South America in the January/March\nquarter, with additional large quantities likely to be imported\nin the April and July quarters from Argentina and Brazil, it\nsaid. No figures were given for imports in the corresponding\nperiods of 1986.\n    The change made sense in view of the recent purchases of\nprobably 250,000 tonnes of West European and Polish rapeseed\nand large scale butter imports that were expected from March\nonward, it said.\n    Oil World said substantial losses of Soviet winter grain\narea due to recent severe frosts were probably behind the\nrecent pick-up in Soviet purchases of U.S. Corn.\n    It noted that an additional one mln tonnes of U.S. Corn had\nbeen bought recently by the Soviet Union.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
