        "BODY": "President Reagan was ready to impose\nretaliatory trade action against Japan for breaking its\nsemiconductor agreement with the United States, White House\nofficials said.\n    There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on\nthe recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb\nJapanese exports to the United States, but officials said the\nmove could come today or early next week.\n    Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan\ninclude tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which use\nsemiconductors.\n    The sources said the tariffs could be slapped on personal\ncomputers, television receivers and laser-printers, with the\naim of penalizing Japan's major electronic firms, including NEC\nCorp, Hitachi Ltd, Toshiba Corp and Fujitsu Ltd.\n    They said Reaan could also delay invoking sanctions for a\nweek or two, giving Japan a final opportunity to end the\ndumping practice, but added that negotiators had already held\nextensive talks with the Japanese to no avail.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
