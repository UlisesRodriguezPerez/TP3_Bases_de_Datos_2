        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, March 17 - ",
        "BODY": "Analyst Sanford Margoshes of Shearson\nLehman Brothers said he recommended a number of oil stocks\ntoday now that it is apparent that OPEC has succeeded in\nholding to its prescribed production quotas.\n    \"It is clear that OPEC, through jawboning and quota\nrestraint, will boost the price of oil,\" Margoshes said.\n    Prices of oil stocks rose sharply today in response to\nhigher oil prices and optimism about OPEC quotas. Margoshes\nsaid he recommends Imperial Oil <IMO.A>, up 1/2 to 49-1/8,\nStandard Oil Co <SRD>, 7/8 to 62-3/4, Exxon <XON> one to\n83-1/8, and Chevron <CHV> 1-1/8 to 54-7/8.\n    In addition, Margoshes said he recommended Atlantic\nRichfield <ARC> on a short-term basis, though he said he is\nstill suspect about its debt situation. Atlantic Richfield rose\n1-3/4 to 77.\n    He said \"the market could come down to test the 16 dlr a\nbarrel level again, but the main thrust of investing in oil is\npositive right now. Before the year is out we will see higher\noil prices.\"\n    He noted that belief that the government is interested in\nraising the strategic reserves is factored into the rise in oil\nstocks today.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
