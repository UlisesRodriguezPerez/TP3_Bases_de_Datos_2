        "BODY": "The White House Economic Policy\nCouncil made a recommendation to President Reagan whether to\nretaliate against Japan for alleged unfair practices in\nsemiconductor trade, U.S. officials said.\n    They would not disclose the council's recommendation, but\nthe officials said earlier it was likely the council would call\nfor retaliation and urge that curbs be imposed on Japanese\nexports to the United States.\n    The officials said it might be several days before Reagan\nwould act and his moves made public.\n    The Senate last week unanimously called on Reagan to impose\npenalities on Japanese exports. Retaliation was also called for\nby the semiconductor industry and its chief trade union, both\nhard hit by Japanese semiconductor trade.\n    In a pact last summer, Japan summer agreed to stop dumping\nits semiconductors at less than cost in the United States and\nother nations and to open its own market to the U.S. products.\n    In return, the United States agreed to hold up imposing\nanti-dumping duties on Japanese semiconductor shipments.\n    U.S. officials say that while Japan has stopped dumping\nsemiconductors on the American market, they have continued to\ndump them in third countries and that the Japanese market has\nremained all but closed to the U.S. semiconductors.\nsemiconductors on the American market, they have continued to\ndump them in third countries and that the Japanese market has\nremained all but closed to the U.S. semiconductors.\n reuter\n\u0003"
