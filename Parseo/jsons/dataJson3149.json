        "BODY": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture will\nprobably decrease its estimate of the 1986/87 Florida orange\ncrop today to as low as 123 mln boxes from 129 mln boxes,\nanalysts and industry sources said.\n    The Department is scheduled to release the new estimate at\n1500 hrs EST (2100 gmt) today.\n    Analysts said the market is anticipating a downward\nrevision and much of the bullish impact has been discounted.\n    The estimate, which the USDA has left unchanged since\nOctober, should be affected this time by recent evidence of a\nshortfall in the early and midseason crop now that those\nharvests are complete. Analysts said based on earlier USDA\nprojections, the harvests should have been five to seven mln\nboxes larger than they were.\n    \"They are going to cut their estimate,\" said Bob Tate, an\nFCOJ broker with Dean Witter Reynolds in Miami. \"The only\nquestion is whether they will admit the whole thing in this\nestimate.\"\n    Tate said it is possible the USDA will lower its estimate\nby a lesser amount, perhaps three mln boxes, and continue to\ndrop the estimate in subsequent reports as the crop picture\nclarifies. The late season harvest, consisting mostly of\nValencia oranges, has not yet started, he noted.\n    \"They'll temper it,\" said Judy Weissman, FCOJ analyst with\nShearson Lehman Bros. \"The main drop will probably come in\nJuly.\"\n    She expects today's estimate will be 126 mln boxes.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
