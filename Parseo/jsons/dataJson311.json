        "TITLE": "ATPC MEMBERS FIND WAYS TO CURB TIN EXPORTS",

        "DATELINE": "    KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 - ",
        "BODY": "Mine and industry officials from\nmost member states of the Association of Tin Producing\nCountries (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit group\nexports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, according\nto views polled by Reuter correspondents.\n    The plan to curb exports, agreed in January, is aimed at\ncutting the world surplus to 50,000 tonnes from 70,000 now and\nboosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16.\n    Members of the seven-member Kuala Lumpur-based ATPC account\nfor some 65 pct of the world's tin output.\n    Under the ATPC plan, Malaysia has been allocated an export\nquota of 28,526 tonnes, Indonesia 24,516, Thailand 19,000,\nBolivia 13,761, Zaire 1,736 and Nigeria 1,461.\n    Australia has said it is not setting any export quota.\nHowever, the tonnage allocated to it, 7,000 tonnes, is roughly\nequal to its expected output this year.\n    Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable.\n    Mine officials in Malaysia, the world's leading producer,\nsaid only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that\noutput is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year started\nMarch 1.\n    Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters that\nexcess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 in\nthe one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock.\n    Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curb\nand asked the government not to issue new mining licences. More\nthan 100 applications for licences are pending.\n    Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mining\nlicences only if a six-month review of production trends showed\nthat local mines were not overproducing.\n    ATPC chairman and Indonesia's Mining and Energy Minister\nSubroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb.\n    A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PT\nTambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia to\nstick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this was\nclose to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636.\n    In Bangkok, Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said\nThailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added this\nwould not cause the local industry hardship at current prices.\n    To insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tin\nexporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encourage\nbigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would be\npermitted, he said.\n    The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected to\ndisallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive\nproduction, industry sources said.\n    But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong told\nReuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo,\nThai miners would press for the opening of more new mines.\n    Thailand exported 18,367 tonnes in 1986, up from 17,359 in\n1985, Pramual said.\n    Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year than\nits allocated 13,761 tonne quota.\n    Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Paz\nthat Bolivia expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin in\ncalendar 1987.\n    He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of\nOctober 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the state\nmining company Comibol, which produces more than 80 pct of\nBolivia's total exports.\n    He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exports\nbut added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be\nachieved. He did not elaborate.\n    Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in\nLagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its\nATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output had\ndeclined due to poor demand and high production costs.\n    Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria's output was\nless than 1,000 tonnes last year.\n    ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries'\nexport figures every three months using customs documents and\nmake projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to\nbe breached within the year-long quota period.\n    The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to\nbreach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures.\n    They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil\ntheir quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other\nmembers at the ATPC's discretion.\n    The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated\n106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan.\n    Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate with\nthe ATPC and limit their exports to 21,000 and 7,000 tonnes\nrespectively during the quota period.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
