        "BODY": "The U.S. index of leading indicators\nfell a seasonally adjusted 1.0 pct in January after a revised\n2.3 pct December gain, the Commerce Department said.\n    The department previously said the index rose 2.1 pct in\nDecember.\n    The decline in January was the biggest for any month since\nJuly, 1984, when the index fell 1.7 pct.\n    The January decrease left the index at 183.8 over its 1967\nbase of 100, and was led by a fall in contracts and orders for\nplant and equipment.\n    A total of six of 10 indicators available for January\ncontributed to the decline.\n    Besides contracts and orders for plant and equipment, they\nwere building permits, manufacturers' new orders for consumer\ngoods, a change in sensitive materials prices, slower\ndeliveries from vendors and higher average weekly claims for\nstate unemployment insurance.\n    Four of 10 indicators were positive, including stock\nprices, new business formation, average work week and money\nsupply.\n    The main factor for the December upward revision was new\nbusiness formation.\n    There was no revision in the 0.9 pct increase in the\nleading indicators index for November.\n    The index of coincident indicators, which measures the\ncurrent economy, fell 0.1 pct in January after increases of 0.7\npct in December and 0.2 pct in November.\n    The index of lagging indicators, which measures past\neconomic activity, rose 0.5 pct in January after a decrease of\n0.5 pct in December and an increase of 0.2 pct in November.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
