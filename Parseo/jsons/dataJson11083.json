        "TITLE": "FED'S POLICY EASE MAY END WITH 2ND QTR RATE CUT",
        "AUTHOR": "    By Martin Cherrin, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, March 30 - ",
        "BODY": "The Federal Reserve's move to easier\nmonetary policy, begun with four quick half-point discount rate\ncuts in 1986, will likely end with a final rate drop in the\nsecond quarter, analysts said.\n    A poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates to\nedge lower, with the Fed likely to drop its basic lending rate\nfrom 5-1/2 pct late next quarter to help the economy.\n    \"The Fed is not likely to ease policy much further without\na full-blown recession,\" said Raymond Stone, chief financial\neconomist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.\n    Stone said economic data available by late June may be just\nweak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut. But he said\nit may only be a quarter-point drop instead of the usual half\npoint, to avoid hurting the dollar further.\n    All of the economists agreed that the Federal Open Market\nCommittee tomorrow will leave Fed policy unchanged.\n    The average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly\nquarter-point drops by the end of June in both the Treasury\nbond yield, to 7-1/2 pct, and the Federal funds rate at which\nbanks lend to one another, to 5-7/8 pct. Most expect the prime\nlending rate at major banks to remain at 7-1/2 pct.\n    Other broad predictions of the survey, relating mainly to\nthe April-June quarter, follow:\n    - The dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further\nagainst other major currencies because of a large U.S. budget\ndeficit and a wide, but narrowing, trade gap. Contacted after\nthe dollar's steep drop in the last two business days, the\neconomists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that\nthe dollar will fall more, rather than less, than they expect.\n    - Oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue\ntrading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well\ntest the lower end of that range.\n    - Stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and\nprobably for all of 1987. Stocks should gain on strong\nforeign demand and a modest second-half economic rise. The\noutlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year\nsince both inflation and interest rates may be edging up.\n    - Inflation as measured by the GNP implicit price deflator\nwill rise to around 3.3 pct this year from 2.7 pct in 1986. The\nsharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation, as will\na mild economic pickup in the second half of this year.\n    - U.S. real gross national product, which grew at a two pct\nannual rate in the 1986 second half, should expand at\nrespective rates of about 2.3 pct and 2.5 pct in the 1987 first\nand second halves. First-quarter growth is put at a 2.4 pct\nannual\nrate, slowing to 2.1 pct next quarter.\n    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International sees\nboth the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among\nthose surveyed. He expects real GNP, which grew at a 1.1 pct\nrate in fourth-quarter 1986, to expand at a 3.3 pct rate this\nquarter and 3.5 pct next quarter.\n    \"The economy will bounce back more strongly than many\nexpect,\" Brusca said. He said an involuntary buildup in\ninventories, largely in autos, will add to first-quarter\neconomic growth, with consumer spending helping later.\n    \"We're running out of special factors to keep the economy\nafloat,\" said Philip Braverman of Irving Securities Corp. His\ninterest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest.\n    Braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation\nhelped lift fourth and first quarter GNP growth, respectively.\nHe expects 2.5 pct first quarter growth but said that second\nquarter growth could be zero or negative.\n    Braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer\nfrom a paring of inventories, lower capital investment, slow \ngovernment spending and less construction. Only a marginally\nnarrower trade deficit will add to growth.\n    He sees a 7.10 pct end-of-June yield on Treasury bonds,\nwith Federal funds and prime rates at 5.50 and seven pct,\nrespectively. Nikko's Brusca projects rates of 8.25 pct for\nbonds, 6.15 pct for funds and 7.75 pct for the prime rate.\n    Two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildly\nafter the dollar's fall to 40-year lows versus the yen in past\ndays and news of pending U.S. trade sanctions against Japan.\n    David Resler of Nomura Securities Co International Inc\nraised his end-June bond yield forecast to 7.50 pct from 7.20\npct and a Fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 5.80 pct.\n    Raul Nicho, president of Money Market Services Inc, lifted\nhis forecast of bond and Fed funds rates an eighth of a point\nto eight pct for bonds and 6-1/4 pct for funds. Both Nicho and\nResler left their end-June prime rate forecast at 7-1/2 pct.\n    The higher rate forecasts reflected a belief that Japanese\ninvestors will be less eager to buy U.S. bonds because of fear\nabout further dollar erosion and perhaps in response to U.S.\ntrade sanctions. Yields may have to rise to lure other buyers.\n......END-JUNE U.S. INTEREST RATE FORECASTS....\n....................T-bonds..Fed funds..Prime..\nNikko Securities.....8.25......6.15......7.75..\nMoney Mkt Services...8.00......6.25......7.50..\nDiscount Corp........7.75......6.25......7.50..\nMerrill Lynch........7.30......5.75......7.50..\nBankers Trust........7.25......5.50......7.50..\nWells Fargo Bank.....7.30......5.60......7.00..\nIrving Securities....7.10......5.50......7.00..\nDean Witter..........7.00......5.50......7.00..\n.FORECAST AVERAGE....7.50......5.875.....7.50..\n.CURRENT LEVELS......7.80......6.125.....7.50..\n Reuter\n\u0003"
