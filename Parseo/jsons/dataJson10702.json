        "BODY": "The recent deterioration in the\nsteel market makes it important for Arbed SA <ARBB.BR> to\nmaintain efforts to reduce costs, the company said in a\nstatement.\n    It reported that its competitive position had weakened\nconsiderably in the second half of 1986, leading to a seven pct\ncut in steel output over the whole of the year to 3.74 mln\ntonnes.\n    Arbed had managed to make a 890 mln franc net profit,\nslightly down from the 1.12 billion profit in 1985, thanks to\nlower raw material costs and prudent management, the company\nsaid.\n    Arbed said the early months of 1987 had seen the market\ndeteriorate further, but the decision of the European Community\nto maintain anti-crisis measures, at least provisionally,\nshould under normal circumstances have a beneficial effect.\n    EC ministers have agreed to extend a quota production\nsystem while discussions continue on an industry plan for\ncapacity reductions.\n    Arbed said in current conditions, cost cutting efforts\nremain necessary to avoid any weakening of resources which have\nbeen built up over the last three years.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
