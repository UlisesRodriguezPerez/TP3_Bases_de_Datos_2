        "DATELINE": "    SINGAPORE, April 2 - ",
        "BODY": "Singapore's major banks are\ndiversifying and gradually shifting their asset holdings from\nloans to debt instruments, banking sources said.\n    The banks following the trend are the <Overseas Union Bank\nLtd>, <United Overseas Bank Ltd>, <Oversea-Chinese Banking\nCorporation> and the <Development Bank of Singapore Ltd>.\n    The shift towards securitisation has been helped by\nvolatile financial markets which have developed hedging\nfacilities such as floating rate notes and bonds for risk\nmanagement, said Overseas Union General Manager Loh Hoon Sun.\n    Loh told Reuters in an interview that Singapore banks see\nlimited growth in credit risk. More and more of them are\nswitching from term lending to major growth areas such as\nstockbroking and fee based income, he said.\n    Major local banks ventured into stockbroking after being\ngranted seats on the stock exchange. Bankers said they are now\nmoving into the new government securities market and the Stock\nExchange of Singapore Dealing and Quotation System.\n    One foreign banker said the Development Bank and the\nOverseas Union Bank Ltd have become major players in the equity\nmarket in Singapore.\n    Loh said the banks' participation in the stock market has\nincreased business transactions and provided long term growth\nfor the market. The banks are not competition for individual\nstockbroking firms because of the increased business they\ngenerate, he added.\n    Loh said the Stock Exchange of Singapore might expand\nequity issues by as much as one billion dlrs this year because\nof the increasing ability of foreign and local market\nparticipants to absorb new issues.\n    Loh said <OUB Investment management Ltd>, a subsidiary of\nthe Overseas Union Bank Ltd, has teamed up with a U.K. Firm to\nlaunch the Union Global Fund. The fund is for local investors\nseeking capital growth through a diversified international\nportfolio. It will invest in international shares with the\nemphasis on U.S. And Japanese markets, he said.\n    <DBS Securities Singapore Pte Ltd>, a subsidiary of the\nDevelopment Bank of Singapore, has applied to the Hong Kong\nStock Exchange to set up a Hong Kong stockbroking firm.\n    Loh predicted fixed deposit and prime interest rates in\nSingapore will stay low this year. As a result, banks will be\nforced to provide fund management services for major clients\nseeking better returns, he said.\n    Economic analysts and bankers are optimistic the major\nbanks will show profits in 1987, helped by higher income from\ntreasury and investment banking activities.\n    They expect the 1987 after-tax profits of Oversea-Chinese\nand United Overseas to show stable growth of four to eight pct\nagainst respective gains of four and seven pct in 1986.\n    Overseas Union's profits are expected to jump to over 40\nmln dlrs from seven mln dlrs in 1986, economists said.\n    The Development Bank's after-tax profits rose 39.2 pct in\n1986 mainly due to a dividend of 20.4 mln dlrs paid by\n<National Discount Company Ltd> before it became a subsidiary\nof the bank, they said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
