        "BODY": "Energy Secretary John Herrington\nsaid his proposed option to raise the oil depletion allowance\nto 27.5 pct was probably the most economically promising way to\nspur domestic production.\n    The White House has said it would consider the option\nalthough it was generally opposed to any revisions in the new\ntax code.\n    Herrington told a meeting of the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas\nAssociation that the higher depletion allowance on new oil and\nenhanced oil recovery would cost taxpayers about 200 mln dlrs a\nyear.\n    The option was one of many contained in a report on oil and\nthe national security the Energy Department sent to the White\nHouse on Tuesday.\n    Herrington said of the increased depletion allowance\noption: \"that is one that could significantly increase\nproduction at a very low cost to the American taxpayer.\"\n    He again rejected an oil import fee as far too costly to\nthe overall U.S. economy.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
