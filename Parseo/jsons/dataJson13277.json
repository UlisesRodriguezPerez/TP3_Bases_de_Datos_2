        "BODY": "The failure of the Bangladesh government\nto tackle the country's current food crisis could lead to a\nfamine, the leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, Khaleda\nZia, told a press conference yesterday.\n    Prices of rice rose by at least 25 pct across the country\nin March and the government has begun emergency rice and wheat\nsales to lower cereal prices, a food ministry report said.\n    Ministry officials said the next harvest, due in mid-April\nwill ease the situation. \"Temporary grain shortage in the arid\nnorth and some other rain-starved regions is not unusual at\nthis time of the year,\" one official said.\n    Khaleda, said corrupt practices by food officials and\nfailure to procure enough grains contributed to the crisis. Her\nremarks coincided with newspaper reports that a continuing heat\nwave has destroyed thousands of acres of crops in the\nsouth-west.\n    Officials said last week Bangladesh now has only 390,000\ntonnes of grain in stock which would be exhausted in two or\nthree weeks. Bangladesh expects to produce 14.5 mln tonnes of\nrice and 1.5 mln tonnes of wheat in 1986/87 ending June 30. It\nrevised its food import target for this fiscal year upward by\n300,000 tonnes to 1.8 mln.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
