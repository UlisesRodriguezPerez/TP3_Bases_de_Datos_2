        "TITLE": "PDVSA INCOME ON OIL SALES FELL 45 PCT IN 1986",
        "DATELINE": "     CARACAS, March 24 - ",
        "BODY": "The state oil company Petroeleos de\nVenezuela ended 1986 with a decrease of 45 pct in income from\noil sales even though it surpassed its own export goal by\nalmost 100,000 barrels a day, Minister of Energy and Mines\nArturo Hernandez Grisanti said.\n    Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annual\nassembly, Hernandez said PDVSA's income from oil sales had\ndropped to 7.2 billion dlrs in 1986, down 45 pct from last\nyear's 13.3 billion.\n    Fiscal revenue from oil sales, which was estimated at 66\nbillion bolivares for 1986, totalled 43.5 billion, a drop of 34\npct which Hernandez said \"had a very serious impact on\nVenezuela.\"\n    PDVSA's export volume averaged 1.508 mln barrels a day, of\nwhich 658,000 bpd were crude oil and 850,000 bpd refined\nproducts.\n    The figure surpassed PDVSA's stated goal of 1.410 mln bpd\nand the 1985 export volume of 1.371 mln bpd. But it was not\nenough to cover the losses from a drop in the average price\nfrom 25.88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13.90 dlrs last year.\n    The 13.90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1.01 dlrs higher\nthan the figure originally announced by the Central Bank.\nHernandez said the increase had come from a new accounting\nsystem which included the results of PDVSA's overseas refining\nand marketing operations.\n    Consumption in Venezuela's internal market increased from\n323,000 bpd in 1985 to 342,000 bpd last year. However,\nHernandez stressed that the government had managed to keep\ngasoline sales almost constant at 164,000 bpd.\n    Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrels\nin reserves of light and medium crudes, shifting the balance of\nVenezuela's reserves away from heavy crude oil. The country's\nproduction capacity at year-end 1986 was 2.562 mln bpd, of\nwhich 1.420 mln are light and medium crudes, Hernandez said.\n     Venezuela's total proven reserves as of December 31, 1986\nwere 55.521 billion barrels, the fourth largest amount in the\nworld, Hernandez said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
