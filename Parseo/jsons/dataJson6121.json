        "BODY": "Coastal Corp said it expected earnings\nfor 1987 \"to be significantly above\" profits of 71.6 mln dlrs\nlast year.\n    In a letter to shareholders appearing in the company's\nnewly-issued 1986 annual report, Coastal chairman Oscar Wyatt\ndid not elaborate on how much earnings were expected to\nincrease.\n    The 1986 profits of Coastal, a natural gas production and\npipeline company, were halved from 1985 levels due to slumping\nenergy prices. The company's sales totaled 6.7 billion dlrs\nlast year.\n    Coastal also said it sold its natural gas for an average\nprice of 2.17 dlrs per mcf in 1986, a drop of 18 pct from the\nprevious year. Oil and natural gas liquids sold for an average\n14.20 dlrs a barrel in 1986, a reduction of 37 pct.\n    The Houston-based company, which produced a daily average\nof 120 mln cubic feet of gas and 11,149 barrels of oil, said it\nhad proved reserves at yearend 1986 of 28.6 mln barrels of oil\nand 954 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Average reserve\nreplacement costs were 8.28 dlrs per barrel of oil equivalent\nduring the past three-year period, representing a little more\nthan half of the industry average, the company said.\n    Coastal's more than 800 gasoline retail outlets were\noperated profitably during 1986 \"and are expected to continue\nto do so,\" the company said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
