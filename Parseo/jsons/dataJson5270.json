        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, March 16 - ",
        "BODY": "Banque Paribas, which arranged a 220\nmln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to pre-finance oil exports,\nwants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the country\nrecover from a devastating earthquake, bankers said.\n    But the French bank's plan, which would effectively\npostpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for several\nmonths, is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52\nmembers of the loan syndicate.\n    The pipeline that carries all Ecuador's oil exports was\nruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take some five months\nto repair at a cost of about 150 mln dlrs to repair.\n    President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated total\ndamages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said that\nEcuador as a result would maintain January's suspension of\ninterest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt.\n    Payments were halted in January because of the drop in the\nprice of oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador's\nexport earnings and 60 pct of government revenue.\n    Although sympathetic to Ecuador's plight, many banks in the\nParibas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a job\nfor international financial organizations and not for\ncommercial banks, bankers said.\n    The 18-month oil-financing facility, which was signed last\nOctober 28, is one of the few purely voluntary credits for a\nLatin American nation since the region's debt crisis erupted in\nAugust 1982.\n    Because it was a voluntary deal, many bankers feel strongly\nthat the orginal terms must be adhered to. Otherwise, they\nfear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditions\nfor Latin borrowers will be set back.\n    \"There's a lot of reluctance by the other banks. They feel\nit's a different facility, and so any kind of suggestion of a\nrestructuring would look bad,\" one banker commented.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
