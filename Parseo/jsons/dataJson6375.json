        "BODY": "A leading Soviet economist said the\npractice of padding figures was significantly inflating the\ncountry's industrial production data.\n    \"According to the information of state monitoring organs,\nthe padding of figures makes up one-and-a-half to three per\ncent of the volume of production,\" Alexei Sergeyev told the\nofficial newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya.\n    \"In my opinion, it is significantly higher,\" Sergeyev, who\nworks at the Economics Institute of the Soviet Union's Academy\nof Sciences, said.\n    Most Western economists have for years allowed for a\ncertain padding of figures when analysing Soviet statistics for\nindustrial production.\n    Sergeyev said about 600 mln roubles was lost annually in\nraw material industries by paying wages and bonuses for work\nwhich was not in fact performed.\n    He said the elimination of figure-padding and other\nmalpractices would save billions of roubles and would pay for\nthe Soviet Union's social development program up to the year\n2000.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
