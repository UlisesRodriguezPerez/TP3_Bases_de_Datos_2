        "BODY": "Swedish mining and metals group\nBoliden AB <BLDS ST> forecast a return to profitability during\n1987 after recording a 1.08 billion crown 1986 loss burdened by\na massive write-off.\n    The company, which consolidated the Swedish wholesale and\ninvestment conglomerate <Ahlsell AB> this year, said the result\nincluded restructuring costs and write-offs of 802 mln crowns.\n    \"These costs have arisen as a results of a change of\ndirection for the group. They are mainly one-off but they have\nburdened the annual accounts,\" the company said in a statement.\n    Boliden said the company's liquid assets were 1.36 billion\ncrowns at year-end which together with an investment portfolio\nof 1.60 billion made it one of the most liquid Swedish\ncompanies.\n    As a result of the 1986 losses, the board proposed\ncancelling dividend for the year although it predicted a return\nto profitability during 1987, the statement added.\n    Swedish tyres, process equipment and components firm\n<Trelleborg AB> has taken a majority stake in Boliden since the\nbeginning of this year. Trelleborg then said it had no plans\nfor consolidating Boliden.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
