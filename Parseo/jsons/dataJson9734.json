        "TITLE": "HOECHST RAISES PROFITS ON LOWER SALES",
        "DATELINE": "    FRANKFURT, March 26 - ",
        "BODY": "Hoechst AG <HFAG.F> said in a\nstatement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite a\nfall in turnover due to lower foreign sales.\n    The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and\nother currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressure\non selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices of\ncrude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale of\npolystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands.\n    World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in\n1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01\nbillion from 42.72 billion.\n    Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billion\nmarks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct.\n    The statement made no mention of net profit figures.\nHoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23.\n    In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by the\ncold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continues\nat present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below the\nprevious year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from\n1986, Hoechst said.\n    Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and information\ntechnology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell.\n    Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance of\nthe parent company, other units in West Germany, and to\n<American Hoechst Corp>.\n    Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected the\nrestructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities.\n    Roussel Uclaf <RUCF.PA> and most domestic non-consolidated\npartners did not perform as well as in 1985.\n    Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretax\nprofits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earnings\nfrom interest and holdings in other companies, and a fall in\nextraordinary costs.\n    The fall in raw material prices was not enough to\ncompensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices and\ncurrencies, Hoechst said.\n    The bulk of the 2.53 billion marks investment in new\nprojects, up from 294 mln marks in 1985, went on the capital\nincrease of Hoechst Capital Corp in connection with the\nacquisition of <Celanese Corp>.\n    Celanese was merged with American Hoechst in February to\nform <Hoechst Celanese Corp>.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
