Moisture\nfor early rice planting is adequate to abundant in most areas,\nand inundative rain in Guangdong and southern Jiangxi may have\nwashed out some rice fields requiring replanting.\n     Light showers in southern Sichuan increased topsoil\nmoisture for corn planting, which likely is off to a slow start\ndue to earlier dryness, it said.\n    In the North China Plain, dry weather covered winter wheat\nin the vegetative stage, and rain is needed to meet increasing\ncrop moisture requirements, it said.\n    Weekly temperatures in the North China Plain were near\nnormal, the agency noted.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
