        "BODY": "The proposed European Community (EC) tax\non vegetable oils and fats is no longer a major issue on the\nagenda and the EC Commission merely used it as a threat, the\nWest German Feed Stuffs Industry Association (MFI) said.\n    Association chairman Ulrich Wagner told a news conference\nthe West German feed industry believes the EC does not\nseriously contemplate the introduction of such a tax because it\nwould end in another transatlantic trade war.\n    \"We have just avoided a trade conflict with the U.S. And the\nCommission used the tax threat to calm national farm lobbies.\"\n    American Soybean Association (ASA) president-elect Wayne\nBennett said yesterday in The Hague that U.S. Soybean producers\nwere confident the tax would be rejected.\n    Bennett, who is leading one of three soybean delegations on\na lobbying tour of EC capitals, will also visit Bonn on\nThursday and Friday.\n    There are indications the Bonn government will also reject\nthe proposed tax, Wagner said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
