        "DATELINE": "    New York, March 2 - ",
        "BODY": "Several analysts said they do not\nbelieve another suitor will top the 265 mln dlr bid for\nPurolator Courier Corp by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and a management\ngroup from Purolator's courier division.\n    There had been speculation another offer might be\nforthcoming, but analysts mostly believe the 35 dlrs per share\nprice being paid by Hutton and the managers' PC Acquisition Inc\nis fully valued.\n    Analysts and some Wall Street sources said they doubted\nanother bidder would emerge since Purolator had been for sale\nfor sometime before a deal was struck with Hutton Friday.\n    Purolator's stock slipped 3/8 today to close at 34-3/4. It\nhad been trading slightly higher than the 35 dlr offer on\nFriday. At least one analyst Friday speculated the company\nmight fetch 38 to 42 dlrs per share.\n    analysts and wall street sources doubted a competitive\noffer would emerge since the company has been for sale for\nsometime before the deal with Hutton was struck Friday.\n    Hutton had been in talks with Purolator's adviser, Dillon,\nRead and Co since late December, a Hutton spokesman said.\n    Hutton is offering 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of the\nshares. If all shares are tendered, shareholders would receive\n29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and warrants for stock in\na subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the Purolator U.S.\ncourier operation. Hutton values the warrants at two to three\ndlrs per share.\n    Wall Street sources also said today that a rival bidder\nmight be discouraged by a breakup fee Purolator would have to\npay if it ends its agreement with Hutton. The sources would not\nreveal the amount of the fee, which will be noted in documents\non the transaction to be made public later this week.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
