        "BODY": "Delegates from the National Pork\nProducers Council, NPPC, yesterday approved programs for\ncontrol and eradication of pseudorabies and establishment of a\nnational safe drug use program.\n    The delegate body, attending the American Pork Congress in\nIndianapolis, approved a pseudorabies control and eradication\nprogram at the state level after a recommendation from NPPC's\nPRV (pseudorabies virus) oversight committee.\n    The PRV committee received results of a three year, five\nstate pilot project which had a 97.5 pct success rate in\neradication of the disease within 116 hog herds. The project\nwas jointly funded by the USDA and NPPC.\n    \"Primarily it (the program) allows individual states to\ndeal with their own problems according to a timetable that\nsuits them best,\" Mike Wehler, member of the NPPC's PRV\noversight committee said.\n    In regards to safe drug use, the delegates approved a plan\nasking that NPPC be active in establishing a national safe drug\nuse program.\n    The program would establish better relationships between\nproducers and veterinarians and eventually lead to a quality\nassurance program in pork production, according to the plan.\n    \"This program basically communicates to the FDA that we are\nconcerned about safe drug use and will do our part to use drugs\nsafely, if FDA will allow the same policy to continue in\neffect,\" Wehler said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
