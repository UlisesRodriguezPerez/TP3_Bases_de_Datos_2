        "TITLE": "UK SUGAR FACTORY CLOSES DUE TO SHORTAGE OF BEET",
        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, Oct 19 - ",
        "BODY": "British Sugar Plc was forced to shut its\nIpswich sugar factory on Sunday afternoon due to an acute\nshortage of beet supplies, a spokesman said, responding to a\nReuter inquiry\n    Beet supplies have dried up at Ipswich due to a combination\nof very wet weather, which has prevented most farmers in the\nfactory's catchment area from harvesting, and last week's\nhurricane which blocked roads.\n    The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads are\ncleared and supplies of beet build up again.\n    This is the first time in many years that a factory has\nbeen closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added.\n    Other factories are continuing to process beet normally,\nbut harvesting remains very difficult in most areas.\n    Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by British\nSugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a year\nout of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes.\n    Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvesting\nproblems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintaining\nits estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2\nmln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, the\nspokesman said.\n    British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K.\n    The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month,\nis expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factories\nnormally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the\ncampaign.\n    As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had been\nharvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13\npct had been lifted. Since then, however, very wet weather has\nseverely restricted beet lifting.\n    Harvesting figures for the week to October 18 are not yet\navailable.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
