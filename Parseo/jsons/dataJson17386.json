        "TITLE": "EC FARM MINISTERS END PRICES MEETING STILL DIVIDED",
        "AUTHOR": "    By Gerrard Raven, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    LUXEMBOURG, April 29 - ",
        "BODY": "European Community (EC) agriculture\nministers ended a three-day meeting in Luxembourg still deeply\ndivided over plans by the EC Commission to curb the cost of the\nEC's farm policy through sharp cuts in farm returns.\n    Their chairman, Belgium's Paul de Keersmaeker, told a news\nconference after the meeting he would work on a paper setting\nout possible compromise solutions in the next two weeks, with\nthe hope that the ministers can get down to detailed\nnegotiations at a meeting in Brussels on May 18.\n    But diplomats said the talks this week had served little\nmore than to clarify member states' positions on the complex\npackage of measures proposed by the commission.\n    The executive body has proposed measures which would result\nin price cuts this year for many crops of upwards of 10 pct.\n    Other controversial plans include a tax on EC-produced and\nimported oilseeds and fats to bring in two billion European\ncurrency units, to help the EC's cash crisis, and changes in\nthe conversion of EC common farm prices into national\ncurrencies which would inflict extra burdens on West German and\nDutch farmers.\n    De Keersmaeker attempted yesterday to narrow differences\nbetween EC states on the oils tax proposal, the currency\nmeasures and the key question of cereals prices and associated\nmeasures.\n    But he told journalists, \"We have used this meeting to reach\nthe point at which real negotiations can start at the next\nmeeting. Ideally they should have started now but our\nprocedures took much longer than planned.\"\n    Ministers are in theory supposed to agree a price package\nby April 1 each year, although this target is seldom reached in\npractice.\n    Diplomats said on all the points there were widely\ndiverging views, with Britain and the Netherlands, the\ncountries most supportive of commission proposals for cereals\nprice cuts, strongly opposed to the oils tax.\n    However, de Keersmaeker said West German objections to the\nmonetary proposals could prove the most difficult issue to\nresolve. \"This is a very tough political nut, and because of the\nvery nature of the problem there is no technical solution,\" he\nsaid. Commission sources said farm commissioner Frans\nAndriessen was prepared to alter some technical aspects of his\nproposals to make an agreement easier.\n    However, because of the EC's budgetary crisis, he had\nlittle room for concessions to pleas for a cut in the impact of\nhis proposals on farmers' incomes as several ministers, led by\nGermany's Ignaz Kiechle, are demanding.\n    EC Commission president Jacques Delors has warned that the\nEC will have an accumulated budgetary deficit of over five\nbillion Ecus by the end of this year, even if the commission\nfarm price package is adopted in its entirety.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
