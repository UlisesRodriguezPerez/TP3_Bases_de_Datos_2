        "TITLE": "U.S. MARKETS OFFER GLIMPSE OF VOLCKER NIGHTMARE",
        "AUTHOR": "    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, April 9 - ",
        "BODY": "Today's turmoil in the U.S. Financial\nmarkets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar's\nwake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that\nis likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said.\n    For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's decline\nas the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fell\nsharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.\n    But that confidence is now cracking as the financial\nmarkets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker's\noften-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.\n    \"Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar\nfreefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it,\" said\nDavid Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.\n    The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in\n40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington\nfailed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a\ncredible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short\nof further depreciation of the dollar.\n    Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid\nworries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare\naway foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.\n    The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12\ndlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike\nin interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down\nby 33 points to 2339.\n    Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the\nmarkets' instability frightening. He believes economic\nfundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that \"once\nyou start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop.\"\n    \"There's a stark possibility that you could get a\ndestabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates\nand drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.\"\n    Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics\nin Washington, has been warning for a long time that the\ncontrolled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and\n264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.\n    \"We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But\nthe agony may be fairly drawn out,\" Marris told Reuters.\n    Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this\nyear, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it\nwould take very little to touch off what he calls the second\nphase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the\ndollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.\n    The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on\nMarch 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.\n    The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with\nhistorical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are\nnot affected until a currency is in the final stages of its\ndecline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.\n    Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest\nweakness was the loss of credibility that central banks\nsuffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling\nbelow 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as\npart of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.\n    Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of\nconfidence was triggered last week when Washington announced\nplans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic\nimports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.\n    Many economists believe that long-run stability will not\nreturn to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is\naddressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the\nmassive budget deficit.\n    But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of\ncentral bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no\nchoice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.\n    \"The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a\nsubstantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding\ncut abroad, at least by Japan,\" said Lanston's Jones.\n    Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest\nrates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for\nAmerican farmers, Latin American governments and others.\n    But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and\nCo, scoffed at the notion. \"It's ridiculous to think the Federal\nReserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak\nagainst just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar\nweakness,\" he said.\n    Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being\nmade toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.\n    \"We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the\nbudget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody\ncares,\" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69\nwill have been greater.\n    He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and\nthinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.\n    But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that\na further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. \"Put on\nyour helmets,\" Giordano said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
