        "DATELINE": "    Chicago, March 16 - ",
        "BODY": "Members of the United Food and\nCommercial Workers union, UFCW, local 222 voted Sunday to go on\nstrike against Iowa Beef Processors Inc Dakota City, Nebraska,\nplant, effective Tuesday.\n    The company submitted their latest offer to the union at\nthe same time announcing that they would end the lockout as of\ntomorrow that started December 14.\n    Members unanimously rejected the latest company offer that\nwas submitted to the union late last week. An overwhelming\nmajority of the approximately 2,500 members attending the\nmeeting then voted to go on strike, UFCW union spokesman Allen\nZack said.\n    Zack said the company's offer for a cut in wages was\nunacceptable and said IBP was refusing to bargain in good\nfaith.\n    IBP's latest offer included wage cuts of 60 cents an hour\nfor slaughter operations and a 45 cents an hour cut in pay for\nprocessing workers. The cut follows the 1.07 dlr cut in pay\nworkers received in 1982 and the wage freeze that has lasted\nsince then, Zack said.\n    The offer also eliminated overtime after eight hours\nfollowing the normal 40 hour work week, he added.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
