        "BODY": "South Korean Trade Minister Rha\nWoong Bae said his nation would maintain a trading surplus for\nthree to five years as a way to cut its foreign debt.\n    He said in an interview with Reuters that after a few years\nit was likely South Korea would drop barriers to foreign goods\nand move toward a more balanced trade position.\n    He said the present trade surplus was vital if his nation\nwas to reduce its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.\n    Rha said that 1986 was the first year South Korea had a\ntrade surplus - 4.5 billion dlrs, against a 1985 deficit of 900\nmln dlrs.\n    Asked if South Korea would drop its trade barriers once its\nforeign debt was substantially reduced, he said \"yes, I think\nso.\"\n    Rha made his remarks at the end of a two-week trade mission\nhere during which a team he led agreed to buy U.S. products\nvalued at 1.8 billion dlrs.\n    About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases are in goods of the\ntype South Korea normally bought from Japan.\n    Rha was to leave later today for Ottawa for trade talks\nwith Canadian officials and businessmen.\n    He said in the interview the U.S. purchases were to reduce\nhis country's 7.1 billion dlr surplus with the United States\nand also to cut its 5.6 billion dlr shortfall with Japan.\n    Rha said it was also due to a shift in exchange rates\nbetween the U.S. dollar and the yen that made it cheaper to buy\nU.S. goods than Japanese goods.\n    He said South Korea heavily relied on foreign trade and he\nhoped the leaders of major trading nations could find a way to\nresolve the growing trend toward protectionist legislation.\n    Rha said \"I hope the leaders can get together to find a\nsolution by making some mutually satisfactory concessions.\"\n    But he added \"the leaders seem hesitant to make concessions\nbecause of domestic political reasons.\"\n    Speaking of his own country, he said \"We have made a lot of\nconcessions already.\"\n    He cited regulations permitting foreign investment in\nindustrial firms, allowing increased foreign banking activity\nand cracking down on piracy of intellectual property by\nstrengthening protection of copyrights and patents.\n    Rha said South Korea had also lowered many of its tariffs.\n    Asked if South Korea would retaliate against U.S. goods if\nCongress closed U.S. markets to its products, he said \"at this\nmoment, we have no thought of retaliation.\"\n    South Korea is a major exporter to the United States of\ntextiles and apparel and electronic goods, such as television\nsets, video cassette records and personal computers.\n    Its puchases from the United States include electronic\ntesting equipment and grains and cotton.\n    The trade mission's purchases here included three Boeing\npassenger planes for 400 mln dlrs, four McDonnell Douglas\nplanes for 300 mln dlrs; and machinery worth 725 mln dlrs.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
