        "AUTHOR": "    By Martin Cherrin, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, March 31 - ",
        "BODY": "Quarter-point prime rate increases to\n7-3/4 pct by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank today will be\nfollowed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of\nthe Federal Reserve's policy intentions, economists said.\n    \"Based on the spread between banks' cost of funds and the\nprime rate, it probably makes sense for others to follow, but\nno rush is likely,\" said Paul McCulley of E.F. Hutton and Co.\n    Citibank's surprise base rate increase, quickly followed by\nChase, sent U.S. bond prices lower and the dollar higher.\n    McCulley said that once the spread between three-month\ncertificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than\n1-1/2 percentage points, there is a strong chance of a prime\nrate increase. It has been under 1-1/4 points recently.\n    However, banks are likely to hold rate increases until they\nsee what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the near\nterm, analysts said. They noted that banks historically like to\nfollow Fed rate movements, rather than lead them. For example,\nthe last prime rate increase occurred in June 1984 when banks\nlifted the rate to 13 pct from 12-1/2 pct after a Fed discount\nrate increase in April of that year.\n    Major banks had been posting a 7-1/2 pct prime rate since\nlast August 26/27, when they lowered the rate from eight pct\nshortly after the Fed's half-point discount rate cut to the\ncurrent 5-1/2 pct level on August 20.\n    \"The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates. There\nshould be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7-1/2\npct rate and others 7-3/4 pct,\" said David Jones of Aubrey G.\nLanston and Co.\n    Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at today's\nmeeting voted no change in Fed policy. But he said the Fed may\nwell foster higher interest rates soon.\n    Jones said that, while the FOMC probably voted no policy\nchange today, it may have decided to apply slight upward rate\npressure later if the dollar weakens, inflation pressures heat\nup or the economy shows sign of strong recovery.\n    \"The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to\ntighten policy when they did today's coupon pass,\" said Joseph\nLiro of S.G. Warburg and Co.\n    In a move that came a day earlier than most expected, the\nFed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by\noffering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds for\nits own account. This seasonal reserve add is called a \"pass.\"\n    \"The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policy\nchange,\" said Elizabeth Reiners, economist at Dean Witter\nReynolds Inc. \n    She said the spread between banks' cost of funds and the\nprime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153\nbasis point average in 1986. Reiners said the spread is not\nreally narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate\nincrease.\n    The Dean Witter economist said that today's prime rate rise\n\"may have been less a response to interest rates than an\nattempt to enhance the (balance sheet) bottom line.\"\n    Reiners said that, given recent problems with loans to\ndeveloping countries, large money center banks with heavy\nexposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in\nan effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans.\n    The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money\nto one another could help determine how many banks match the\nhigher prime rate and also how quickly they move.\n    In raising their prime rates, banks cited a higher cost of\nfunds. In the three business days through Monday, the Federal\nfunds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly\n6-1/4 pct. But quarter end pressures helped push up funds.  \n    The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today, reflecting\ndemand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the\nclose of the Japanese fiscal year. Funds traded between five\nand 6-3/4 pct.\n    Once the special distortions end, analysts said the funds\nrate probably will return to its recent trading level in the\n6-1/8 pct area. They said that, if it stabilizes near there,\nbanks may not quickly boost their prime rates.\n    But a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many\nthat the Fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to\nhelp the dollar. Then banks would lift prime rates quickly.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
