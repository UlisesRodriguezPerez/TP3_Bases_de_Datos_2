        "BODY": "There is little chance Soviet exports\nto the United States will rise in 1987, but Moscow's current\ntrade reforms should result in more trade in manufactured goods\nin future, a Soviet economist said.\n    Sergey Frolov, chief economist at Amtorg Trading Corp, an\nagent for Soviet trade organisations and industries, told a\nU.S.-USSR business meeting the Soviet Union produces few items\nthat western nations want.\n    But reforms, including upgrading the quality of goods and\nallowing joint ventures with foreign firms, will encourage\nmodest export gains in future.\n    Frolov said the Soviet Union exported 500 mln dlrs worth of\ngoods to the United States in 1986 and imported 1.5 billion\ndlrs worth. He gave no trade forecast for 1987.\n    But he said that even if all obstacles were removed, total\ntrade between the two countries would remain between two and\nthree billion dlrs a year.\n    \"The post-detente embargoes have taught the USSR to limit\nits trading with the U.S.,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
