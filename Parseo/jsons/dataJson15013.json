        "BODY": "Roughly half of this year's expected\n130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground,\na spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the\nNetherlands, told Reuters.\n    Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date\nfor the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April\n23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman\nadded.\n    \"It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can\nexpect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the\ncrop is off to a very good start,\" he said.\n    Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600\nhectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of\nwhite sugar, substantially more than the country's combined \"A\"\nand \"B\" quota of 872,000 tonnes.\n    This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been\nintroduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000\nhectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000\ntonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota \"C\" sugar produced.\n    Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been\nallotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being\nboosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
