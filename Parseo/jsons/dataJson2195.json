        "BODY": "The National Farmers Union, NFU, remains\nconcerned about the future ownership of British Sugar despite\nlast week's decision by the government to block bids from\nItaly's Gruppo Ferruzzi and Britain's Tate & Lyle Plc.\n    The union's sugar beet committee met yesterday to consider\nthe implications of a government Monopolies and Merger\nCommission, MMC, report issued last week. \"We are still\nconcerned about S and W Berisford being long-term owners of\nBritish Sugar,\" a spokesman said. \"We do not view Berisford as\nproviding the long-term stability we want.\"\n    The Trade and Industry Secretary accepted a recommendation\nlast week by the MMC that it block a bid by Tate and Lyle for S\nand W Berisford Plc and stop Gruppo Ferruzzi buying a majority\nof British Sugar, owned by Berisford.\n    Union officials believe a new bid for the monopoly beet\nprocessor is now likely. \"We are looking again at the\nundertakings that we have demanded of existing bidders and\nwhich we would seek of any future bidders,\" the spokesman said.\nThe NFU, which represents Britain's 11,500 sugar beet growers,\nis also taking legal advice on particular paragraphs in the MMC\nreport which it says need further explanation.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
