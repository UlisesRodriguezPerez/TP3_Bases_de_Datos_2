        "BODY": "The International Cocoa Organization,\nICCO, buffer stock working group began examining a draft\nproposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon, delegates said.\n    The plan, presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena\nErbynn, represented a compromise between producer, European\nCommunity, EC, and other consumer views on how the buffer stock\nshould operate, they said.\n    The proposal involved three key principles. First, the\nbuffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather\nthan using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said.\n    Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would be\nfree to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said.\n    The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa could\ncomprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the third\nlaid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager\nwould pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to be\nset by a formula, the delegates said.\n    After the plan was presented, working group delegates met\nbriefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and all\nconsumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reaction\nto the scheme and will respond to it when the working group\nmeets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said.\n    Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to\nwork from, one consumer delegate said.\n    Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for\nnegotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
