        "BODY": "Geonex Corp <GEOX> said\nBellSouth Corp <BLS> unit Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph\nCo's decision to postpone the start up of new conversion\nassignments at Geonex's Chicago Aerial Survey unit could\nnegatively affect its fiscal 1987 revenues.\n    The company said it had expected higher revenues from the\nrecords conversion work, but it now foresees revenues from\nSouthern Bell work at about eight mln dlrs, the same level as\nlast fiscal year.\n    Geonex said Southern Bell will let CAS continue work in\nprogress and it expects to perform mechanized posting and\nrecords conversion for Southern Bell through 1989.\n    But, it added that the Southern Bell decision has forced it\nto pursue opportunities with other telephone companies and\nmunicipalities to replace the Southern Bell work.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
