        "DATELINE": "    ROTTERDAM, April 8 - ",
        "BODY": "The two sides in the Rotterdam port\ngeneral cargo dispute have agreed to appoint an independent\nchairman, Han Lammers, to preside over future meetings,\nemployers' spokesman Gerard Zeebregts said.\n    Lammers, Queen's Commissioner for the province of\nFlevoland, will not act as a mediator but will draw up an\nagenda and procedures for meetings between the employers and\nunions on a work-practice agreement and proposed redundancies.\n    Two months of strikes in the sector began on January 19 in\nprotest at employers' proposals for 350 redundancies from the\n4,000-strong workforce this year.\n    The strikes were called off by the main port union FNV on\nMarch 13 following an Amsterdam court's interim injunction\nagainst the redundancies on procedural grounds.\n    The court is due to make a final ruling on May 7 but\nZeebregts said he expected the judgment to go against the\nemployers and they were therefore very likely to restart the\ncomplicated legal redundancy procedures in the near future.\n    Meanwhile, the dispute over a new work-practice agreement\nin the port's grain sector continued, with 30 maintenance\nworkers on strike, although loading was not affected, a\nspokesman for Graan Elevator Mij, the largest employer in the\nsector, said.\n    The employers have written to the union asking it to\nreconsider its position and a meeting of union members has been\ncalled for tomorrow.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
