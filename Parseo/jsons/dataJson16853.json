        "DATELINE": "    PARIS, April 17 - ",
        "BODY": "The Bank of France said in its latest\nmonthly report on the French economy it expected a pickup in\nindustrial production registered in March to gather steam over\nthe next few months.\n    Without giving figures, the report said last month's rise,\npartly linked to efforts to catch up with production lost\nearlier this year through industrial action, was due mainly to\na firming of domestic demand.\n    \"New progress is expected in all main sectors except capital\ngoods where production will remain at its present level,\" the\nreport added.\n    The upbeat report comes in the wake of grim March trade\nbalance figures which showed a deficit in industrial trade for\nthe first time since June 1982.\n    While the automobile industry remained unchanged from\npreviously boosted levels, consumer goods production grew and\nwas expected to accelerate except in the area of domestic\nappliances. Semi-finished goods showed a clear increase in all\nsectors. Construction and civil engineering, boosted by a rise\nin public works, also improved, while retail trade sales in all\nsectors continued to slow.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
