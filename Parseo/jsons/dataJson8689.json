        "BODY": "Merrill Lynch and Co Inc is holding\ntalks on acquiring Canadian brokerage firms, a company\nspokesman told Reuters.\n    He said one of the firms with which Merrill Lynch is\nnegotiating is <Burns Fry Corp> of Toronto, which has already\nreceived an offer from Security Pacific Corp's <SPC> 83 pct\nowned <Hoare Govett Ltd> London-based brokerage unit.  The\nHoare Govett bid is valued at about 210.4 mln U.S. dlrs.\n    The spokesman said the talks are the result of a change in\nOntario securities laws that takes effect June 30.\n    Currently, companies outside the Canadian securities\nindustry are prohibited from owning more than 10 pct of a\nCanadian broker.  On June 30, 1987, foreign brokers will be\nallowed to own up to 50 pct of Canadian brokers, and the\npercentage will rise to 100 pct a year later.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
