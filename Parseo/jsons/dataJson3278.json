        "BODY": "The London Meat Futures Exchange, LMFE,\nwill cease trading in its deliverable pigmeat contract from\nApril 3, the LMFE said.\n    The move will enable the exchange to concentrate on the\ncash settled contracts introduced last year.\n    \"This allows the exchange and its members to concentrate our\nmarketing on the pig and live cattle contracts,\" LMFE official\nPeter Freeman said. \"These two have already shown their\neffectiveness for hedging, and the trade in both contracts is\nincreasing,\" he added.\n    \"Using the futures market allows better planning and forward\nprice fixing that our industry needs,\" chairman Pat Elmer said.\n    Some 131 pig contracts were settled against the Meat and\nLivestock Commission's Average All Pigs Price in February,\nwhich represents hedging for over 13,000 pigs, more than twice\nthe number cash-settled in January, the LMFE said.\n    Cash settlement on the new cattle and pig contracts was\nintroduced last June in the expectation that the appeal of the\nfutures market to farmers, abattoirs and users of meat would\nincrease because of the absence of a delivery requirement.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
