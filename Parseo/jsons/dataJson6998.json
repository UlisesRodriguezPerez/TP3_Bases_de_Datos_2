        "BODY": "The rebate granted at yesterday's EC\nsugar tender represents some concession to producers'\ncomplaints that they are losing money on exports outside the\nbloc, EC Commission officials said.\n    The maximum rebate of 44.819 European currency units (Ecus)\nper 100 kilos was 1.3 Ecus below what producers say is needed\nto obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales into\nintervention.\n    The rebate at last week's tender was 2.5 Ecus per 100 kilos\nshort of the level producers said was needed, the officials\nsaid.\n    The officials said the Commission is not negotiating with\nproducers who have offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar\nfor sale into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade\nit to offer higher rebates.\n    They said the French and German producers involved are now\nunable to withdraw this offer before April 1 when the sugar\nwill officially enter intervention stores.\n    Payment for it is due five weeks later, and it will be open\nto them to withdraw their offers at any time between April 1\nand the official payment date when the Commission officially\ntakes ownership of the sugar, the officials said.\n    The officials said if the Commission has to buy the sugar,\nit is determined to immediately resell it, a move which would\ndrive down market prices further.\n    They expressed some hope that the operators would not\neventually go through with their plan for intervention sales.\n    \"We think they realise they have gone too far,\" one official\nsaid.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
