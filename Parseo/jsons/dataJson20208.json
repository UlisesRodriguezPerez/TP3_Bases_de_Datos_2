        "DATELINE": "    HAMBURG, Oct 20 - ",
        "BODY": "Oilmeal demand remained strong in the\nUnited States in July and August and six pct up on levels seen\nin the same months last year, with most of the rise coming in\nsoymeal, the Hamburg based publication Oil World said.\n    Total U.S domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose to\na record 19 mln tonnes in October 1986/August 1987, up 4.2 pct\non the same year-ago period, with the increase in soymeal at\nseven pct, it said.\n    Soviet soymeal demand rose by 310,000 tonnes in July and\n330,000 tonnes in August over the respective year-ago months\nfollowing a huge increase in soymeal imports.\n    Oil World presumed some imports were not used immediately\nbut went into stocks. With imports again large in September, it\nestimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800,000 tonnes by\nOctober 1 from around 130,000 at the same time last year.\n    EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a year\nearlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed,\nsunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due to\nbumper EC crops. It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record\n5.9 mln tonnes, up from 3.7 mln last year. Rapeseed disposals\nwere reported at 2.1 mln tonnes by September 20 against 1.4 mln\nat that time last year.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
