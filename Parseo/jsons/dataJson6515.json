        "BODY": "Silver looks \"unlikely to break out of\ngold and platinum's shadow\" in the near future, although this\nyear is likely to see demand increasing at a faster rate than\nsupply, a study by Credit Suisse said.\n    The study predicted demand rising by 300 tonnes to 13,200\ntonnes this year, against a 50 tonne increase in supply to\n14,050 tonnes. This should cut the global oversupply to 850\ntonnes from last year's provisional 1,100 tonnes.\n    The study noted that the effects of last year's lower\nprices were having a dampening effect on total supply, which\nwas now back down to around levels of a decade ago.\n    However, the study said that primary production, likely to\nreach 10,000 tonnes this year against a provisional 9,950 in\n1986, is relatively insensitive to price falls.\n    Around a third of silver production comes from heavily\nindebted Mexico and Peru.\n    Price-sensitivity is also reduced by the fact that the\nmajority of silver is a by-product of other mining activity.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
