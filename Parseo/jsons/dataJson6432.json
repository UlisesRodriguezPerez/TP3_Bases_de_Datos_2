        "BODY": "Malaysia's state oil company Petronas\nwill cut oil production to 420,000 barrels per day (bpd) from\nMay 1, trade sources said.\n    Malaysia cut its 510,000 bpd target output by 10 pct last\nSeptember to support Opec moves to boost prices, and the latest\ncut would reduce output by 17.5 pct from 1986's target level.\n    Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its\n10 pct production cutback until mid-1987.\n    However, the Finance Ministry said in its annual report\nthat Malaysia's crude oil output was expected to rise to an\naverage 510,000 bpd in 1987.\n    The ministry's forecast assumed average 1987 crude prices\nat 13 dlrs/barrel (bbl), but prices have risen enough to permit\nfurther production cutbacks, the sources said.\n    Malaysia's benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs/bbl\nthis year against a low of 10.50 dlrs/bbl in July, they said.\n    Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add to\nthe tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reduced\nIndonesian and Chinese crude output.\n    The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices, as\nthere is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases due\nto the availability of cheaper alternatives, the sources said.\n    In addition to term sales, Petronas has been offering two\nto three 400,000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each month\nfor sale through tender, the sources said.\n    However, this practice is likely to dwindle given the\nreduced scale of production, they said.\n\u0003"
