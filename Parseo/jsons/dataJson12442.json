        "BODY": "About 8,000 black miners returned\nto work after a week-long industrial action at South Africa's\nlargest gold mine, mine owner Anglo American Corp of South\nAfrica Ltd <ANGL.J> said.\n    A spokesman for the mining house said the action started on\nWednesday last week when thousands of miners staged a go-slow\nat One underground shaft of the Free State Geduld division of\nFree State Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd <FSCN.J>.\n    The action later escalated into an underground sit-in at\nthe mine over the weekend, prompting management to close the\naffected shaft because of what the company described as \"the\ncreation of unsafe working conditions.\"\n    Anglo American spokesman John Kingsley-Jones said the\ncompany held talks with the National Union of Mineworkers\n(NUM), South Africa's biggest trade union which claims a\nmembership of 360,000 black workers, but failed to establish\nthe cause of worker dissatisfaction. He acknowledged that the\nmine suffered a loss of production, but declined to give\nestimates.\n    Free State Consolidated last year produced 104 tonnes of\ngold from 28 underground shafts.\n    The NUM was not immediately available for comment on the\naction. But a spokesman for the union earlier told the South\nAfrican Press Association that miners had been locked out of\nthe mine at the weekend after staging a strike in protest\nagainst being ordered to carry bags containing explosives as\nwell as food for white miners.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
