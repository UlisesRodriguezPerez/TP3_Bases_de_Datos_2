        "BODY": "Arvin Industries Inc said higher\ninterest costs from borrowings to make acquisitions will\nproduce earnings flat with last year's 59 cts a share results.\n    Arvin said it might earn 57 cts to 60 cts a share in the\nquarter.\n    These results also reflect the seasonally low sales pattern\nof automotive replacement parts in that period.\n    Arvin forecast about 85 cts a share net in the second\nquarter compared with 68 cts in last year's period.\n    The company said revenues for full year 1987 it will exceed\n1.4 billion dlrs, net earnings will increase more than 30 pct,\nwhile per share earnings should increase 12 to 18 pct.\n    Arvin's 1986 revenues were 995.6 mln, net reached 41.2 mln\nand earnings per share 2.46 dlrs.\n    It based these forecasts due to the addition of Schrader\nAutomotive Inc and Maremont Corp, both acquired last year.\n    Chairman James Baker said 1987 quarterly comparisons will\nnot conform to historical patterns for the year because the\nacquisitions of Schrader and Maremond occurred in different\nquarters.\n    He said Arvin will complete the purchase of Systems\nResearch Laboratories in the second quarter of 1987. This will\nalso increase revenues.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
