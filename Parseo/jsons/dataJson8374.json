        "BODY": "The European Community (EC) cereals\ntrade lobby organisation Coceral said it has written to EC Farm\nCommissioner Frans Andriessen to propose a new system for sales\ninto intervention, which it claims could save the EC budget\nmoney.\n    It proposes that applications for intervention be made\nthrough a certificate valid for execution three months later.\nIf during the three months the trader found a market elsewhere,\nhe could buy back the certificate on payment of a one pct\npremium.\n    Coceral argues that this would restore the original\nfunction of intervention as a safety net and would end the\npresent situation in which produce is often sold into\nintervention as a precaution.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
