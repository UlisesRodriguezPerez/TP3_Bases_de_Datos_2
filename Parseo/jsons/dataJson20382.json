The spokesman could not say when this might be\nbut trade sources said an announcement could come at the end of\nthe week, opening registraions from Monday.\n    A meeting has been set for tomorrow in Brasilia of the\nCNPC's export marketing committee to establish a system for\nallocating the 25 pct of export quotas based on stock levels,\nthe spokesman added.\n    A system of individual export quotas is being reestablished\nin Brazil - a previous system was abandoned in 1985 - to ensure\nshipments are kept in line with the country's ICO quota.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
