        "BODY": "Italy's gross domestic product (GDP) will\ngrow three pct in real terms this year and 2.7 pct in 1988,\nsaid economic information company Data Resources Europe Inc\n(DRI).\n    Michel Girardin, DRI Europe's senior economist, said at a\nconference that Italian GDP growth this year \"will be mainly\ndriven by consumption and especially investment.\"\n    Girardin said the driving force behind GDP growth next year\nwill shift from domestic demand to exports as a result of\nexpected depreciation of the lira against the major currencies.\n    Italy's budget ministry said yesterday that GDP rose 2.7\npct in real terms in 1986.\n    DRI forecast that inflation, which was an average 6.3 pct\nin 1986, will be under five pct this year and that interest\nrates should drop two pct.\n    Girardin said the lira is expected to appreciate 14 pct\nagainst the dollar this year following last year's 22 pct\nappreciation. An expected German mark appreciation against the\ndollar means that the lira should lose about six pct of its\nvalue relative to the German currency, he said.\n    DRI estimates that foreign demand for Italian products\nshould grow by a 3.2 pct this year following last year's 6.2\npct increase.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
