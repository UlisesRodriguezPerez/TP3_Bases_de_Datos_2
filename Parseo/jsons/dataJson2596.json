        "BODY": "Dome Petroleum Ltd's 23.2 pct stake of\ngold producer Dome Mines Ltd continues to be for sale \"at the\nright price,\" spokesman David Annesley said in response to an\ninquiry.\n    Reaffirming remarks made last year by chairman Howard\nMacdonald, Annesley said the company is considering selling its\nstake in Dome Mines.\n    Concerning Dome Petroleum's 42 pct stake in <Encor Energy\nCorp Ltd>, Annesley said \"Encor is a strategic investment for\nDome, and we have no intention of selling it.\"\n    Dome spokesman Annesley said in answer to a question that\nhe was not aware of any negotiations now under way toward the\nsale of Dome Petroleum's 20.9 mln Dome Mines shares.\n    He also declined to specify at what price the company would\nconsider selling it shares.\n    \"Clearly today's prices of more than 15 dlrs a share (of\nDome Mines stock) are very attractive,\" Annesley commented.\n    \"We were considering the sale 'at the right price' at a time\nwhen the shares were priced around nine to 10 dlrs,\" he added. A\nprice of around 15 dlrs a share would be considered \"fairly\nattractive,\" Annesley said.\n    Annesley also Dome Petroleum may be able to sell its Dome\nMines' shares at a premium to market prices. \"There might be an\nopportunity to pick up a premium on that because it would be\nvirtually a control block in Dome Mines,\" he said.\n    Dome Mines shares traded earlier at 15-1/4 dlrs, off 1/4 on\nthe Toronto Stock Exchange.\n    Dome Petroleum is now negotiating a plan to restructure\ndebt of more than 6.1 billion Canadian dlrs with a group of 56\nmajor creditors, which includes Dome Mines and Encor Energy.\n    The company previously said it expects to detail the plan\nto lenders early next week.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
