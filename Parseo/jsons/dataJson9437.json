        "BODY": "Todd Shipyards Corp said it\nomitted payment of the quarterly dividend on its common stock\nand lowered the dividend on its series A preferred stock to 75\ncts from 77 cts a share.\n    Todd said the 75 ct preferred dividend will be paid May one\nto shareholders of record April 15.\n    The company said it omitted the common dividend to cover\nboth losses from a commercial ship conversion contract and\nincreased reserves for previously announced discontinued\nshipyard operations.\n    In addition, the company said its lenders agreed to\ntemporarily reduce the net worth requirement of its revolving\ncredit and term-loan pact to 140 mln dlrs from 130 mln.\n    The reduction will hold through May 15, it said.\n    Todd said the reduction in the net worth requirement\nallowed for the payment of the preferred dividend and prevented\nit from violating covenants of its credit agreement.\n    The company said it is also negotiating with its lenders to\nextend the reduced net worth terms beyond May 15.\n    Todd added that it has suffered financially because of the\nU.S. Navy's unwillingness to release certain retentions under\ncompleted ship construction contracts and a general decrease in\nU.S. military spending.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
