        "BODY": "Citibank A/S <CCI.N>, the Norwegian\nsubsidiary of the U.S.-based bank, said it made a net loss of\njust over six mln crowns in 1986 -- although foreign bankers\nsaid they expect it to show 1987 profits after two lean years.\n    Citibank's Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad told\nReuters, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries\noperating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring for\ninvestment banking away from commercial banking and an economic\nslump in Norway following last year's plunge in oil prices.\n    Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in\nNorway since 1985.\n    Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway's\nsecond-hand securities and equities markets, to be approved\nlater this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements would\nmake profit this year.\n    Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, but\nSejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of planned\nliberalisation and better economic performance, helped by a\nsteadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel.\n    Earlier this year, Chase Manhattan Bank's <CMB.N>\nsubsidiary decided to stop foreign exchange trading after heavy\nlosses and focus instead on fee-based merchant banking.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
