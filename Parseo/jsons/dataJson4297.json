        "BODY": "Uncertainty is growing about the prospects\nfor the economy as orders for industry fall and companies scale\nback investment plans, the German Savings Banks and Giro\nAssociation said.\n    Exporters expect foreign demand to remain weak, while\nindustry is less optimistic than it was, the association said\nin a report.\n    However, last month's agreement among the six leading\nwestern industrialized countries to keep currencies around\npresent levels was expected to be a stabilizing influence for\nexporters, it added.\n    The banking association said the possibility of using\nmonetary policy to stimulate the economy should not be\noverestimated.\n    Another small drop in already low interest rates could not\nbe expected to cause any significant rise in purchases of\nconsumer or capital goods, it said.\n    The Bundesbank's half-point cuts in the discount and\nLombard rates in January have largely exhausted the scope for\nany further monetary moves, the association added.\n    On Tuesday the Federal Statistics Office said gross\nnational product stagnated in real, seasonally and calendar\nadjusted terms in the fourth quarter of 1986 compared with the\nthird quarter.\n    The Economics Ministry, commenting on the figures, said GNP\nin the 1987 first quarter was also expected to be relatively\nweak.\n    Bank economists have forecast the economy will either\nstagnate or contract slightly in the first quarter. Official\nfirst-quarter figures are due in early June.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
