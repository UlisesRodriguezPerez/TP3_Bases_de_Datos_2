        "BODY": "The Bank of Spain raised overnight call\nmoney rates by 1/4 to 14 pct on demand for 746 billion pesetas\nin today's auction, which a bank spokesman termed \"heavy.\"\n    Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of the year and have\nbeen increased to drain liquidity on rising demands for funds,\nthe spokesman said.\n    He said in reply to Reuters inquiries that rates could rise\nfurther if money supply growth rose above this year's eight pct\ntarget for M-4, defined as liquid assets in public hands.\n    Money supply rose at an annualised rate of 16.7 pct last\nmonth against 8.1 pct in January. Growth was 11.4 pct in 1986.\n    A leading Spanish broker said the central bank was applying\na more restrictive policy to keep the lid on inflation.\n    The consumer price index rose 8.3 pct last year.\n    \"Money supply control is the government's chief weapon\nagainst inflation,\" he said. \"The problem is higher rates are\nattracting liquidity from abroad.\"\n    He said this was why the central bank enacted specific\nmeasures to control the inflow of foreign capital. The Bank of\nSpain earlier this month imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement\non new convertible peseta funds held by banks to curb\nshort-term speculative capital from abroad.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
