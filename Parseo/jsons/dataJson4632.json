        "BODY": "Japan denied breaking a pact with the\nU.S. On semiconductor trade but said prices set out in the pact\nwere too high and acknowledged difficulties in implementing the\naccord.\n    \"We are faithfully abiding by the ... Agreement but of\ncourse there are some problems,\" a spokesman for the\nInternational Trade and Industry Ministry told Reuters.\n    He said the high semiconductor prices recommended by the\nagreement were leaving Japanese manufacturers piling up stocks\nof unsellable products. \"We are aiming to reduce production in\nJapan but of course this takes time,\" he said.\n    The spokesman said some Japanese companies were selling\nchips in Europe and Asia below stipulated prices, but added: \"It\nis only a matter of time before we solve this problem.\"\n    The eight month old pact aims to stop Japan selling large\nquantities of chips at knock-down prices to the United States\nand other countries and to increase U.S. Semiconductor sales in\nJapan.\n    The U.S. Senate Finance Committee this week called on\nPresident Reagan in a non-binding resolution to retaliate\nagainst Japan for violating the agreement.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
