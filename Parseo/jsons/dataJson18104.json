        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, June 2 - ",
        "BODY": "The White House has completed a new\nreview of Japanese semiconductor trading practices but has not\nyet decided whether trade sanctions levied against Japan last\nApril should be lifted, U.S. officials said.\n    They said the president's Economic Policy Council looked at\nJapan's adherence to the 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact\nyesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly.\n    But there was no hint what the announcement might be.\n    Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs of\nJapanese exports could be modified if Japan was found to be\nhonoring a portion of its semiconductor pact.\n    But they also noted that the White House has said it was\nunlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of the\nworld's seven major economic powers in Venice on June 8-10.\n    The officials added that while the curbs complicated\nU.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt \nCongressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was not\ntaking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit.\n    Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation for\nJapan's failure to honor commitments to end dumping\nsemiconductors in world markets at less than production costs\nand to open its own market to U.S. goods.\n    The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese television\nsets, personal computers and hand-held power tools.\n    Reagan, in imposing the curbs, said they would be lifted as\nsoon as there was evidence of a pattern that Japan was adhering\nto the pact.\n reuter\n\u0003"
