That tender originally\nonly sought two to three cargoes but resulted in the sale of\neight. India also granted the sellers options to sell twice\nthat amount at the same price but for April/May shipment.\n    Depending on prices, traders said it would be likely for\nIndia again to buy more than the tonnage formally sought.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
