        "BODY": "Federal Reserve Board Vice-Chairman\nManuel Johnson cautioned against seeking \"quick-fix solutions\" to\npersistent U.S. trade and federal budget deficits.\n    In particular, he told an American Stock Exchange\nconference, a decline in the dollar below current levels would\nexacerbate financial market conditions.\n    \"Trying to artificially depress the dollar severely below\ncurrent levels ... would exacerbate financial market conditions\nand lead to further potential for financial problems.\"\n    Nowhere, Johnson said, are Fed officials hearing that U.S.\nbusinesses cannot compete at current exchange rates.\n    He acknowledged the U.S. trade deficit was persisting\ndespite a decline in the dollar's value of 40 to 50 pct in the\npast two years.\n    But the deficit is improving in volume terms and will soon\nbegin showing improvement.\n    \"The stage I think is being set for a healthy, constructive\nexpansion without inflationary instability,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
