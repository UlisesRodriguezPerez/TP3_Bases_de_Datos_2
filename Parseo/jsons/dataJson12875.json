        "BODY": "The Bundesbank's gross currency\nreserves rose 300 mln marks in the last week of March to 104.9\nbillion marks, the Bundesbank said in a statement.\n    At the same time its foreign liabilities rose 100 mln to\n22.8 billion, producing a rise in net reserves of 200 mln to\n82.2 billion on March 31.\n    The Bundesbank provided banks with liquidity in the fourth\nMarch week by disbursing funds in the money market via\ngovernment-owned banks. Banks took up the Bundesbank's standing\noffer of treasury bills to place excess liquidity.\n    Banks received more liquidity through routine month-end\npayments by public authorities as well as expansionary market\nfactors than was lost through the 2.3 billion mark rise in cash\nin circulation to 122.3 billion, the Bundesbank said.\n    But banks had to draw heavily on the Lombard emergency\nfinancing facility due to month-end tightness, borrowing 5.3\nbillion marks.\n    Overall, banks' holdings at the Bundesbank rose 10.2\nbillion marks to 58.5 billion at the end of the month,\naveraging 50.9 billion in the whole of March.\n    The minimum reserve requirement for March, before deduction\nof banks' cash holdings, was set at 61 billion marks.\n    Public authorities' net holdings at the Bundesbank fell to\n2.2 billion marks in the last March week from 4.4 billion the\nweek before. The federal states' holdings fell 2.6 billion to\n2.4 billion.\n    The federal government's holdings rose 700 mln marks to 5.1\nbillion.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
