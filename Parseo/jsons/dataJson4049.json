        "BODY": "International efforts to redirect Japan's\nexport-driven economy toward domestic consumption face heavy\ngoing if the country's largest defence contractor and world's\nbiggest shipbuilder is anything to go by.\n    Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd <MITH.T> (MHI), which began\nmaking ships and iron goods for Japan's military rulers 130\nyears ago, is responding to the strong yen by redoubling its\nefforts to maintain its share of export markets.\n    \"If we sell the best quality and the cheapest products,\neveryone will buy them,\" MHI president Yotaro Iida said.\n    Although two of MHI's main businesses, shipbuilding and\npower plant construction, have been hit hard by the yen's 40\npct rise against the dollar, the company has no plans to\nabandon them, Iida told Reuters in an interview.\n    Its other big activity, aircraft component manufacture, has\nperformed so well that MHI now accounts for half of the money\nTokyo spends on defence procurement each year.\n    \"We have made the utmost efforts among the world's\nmanufacturers to improve productivity,\" he said. \"You may be\nsurprised if you come to see our plants. The outside is old but\nthe inside is ultra-modern, with robots and computers.\"\n    Securities analysts at major securities houses agreed that\nMHI has pared costs more quickly than its competitors. The\ncompany has slashed its workforce to 47,000 from 86,000 in\n1976.\n    Despite its cost-cutting, MHI expects profits to drop 40\npct to 30 billion yen in the current fiscal year ending March\n31, from 1985/86's record 50.14 billion.\n    And that includes gains from the sale of MHI's stake in\nMitsubishi Motors Corp <MIMT.T> for 49 billion yen.\n    Iida is optimistic about the future, however. He said a\nresurgence of demand from the Middle East following the recent\nrecovery in oil prices coupled with persistent demand for power\nplants in developing countries will help MHI restore its\nexports-to-sales ratio to the past decade's average of 30 pct.\n    MHI's exports-to-sales ratio fell to 25.9 pct in the\nhalf-year ended last September, from 35 to 36 pct five years\nago.\n    China is the most promising market, although MHI also\nconsiders other non-oil-producing developing countries as major\ncustomers.\n    \"Our customers are all seen as being in trouble due to a\nlack of foreign currency,\" Iida said. But he added that he felt\nMHI could sell to those markets with Japanese government\nfinancial support.\n    It can also finance the plants itself and recover its\ninvestment through product sales, a strategy Iida said could\nprove popular in the future.\n    In shipping, MHI is fighting back against low-priced South\nKorean competition by building more technologically advanced\ncarriers to carry liquefied natural gas and other products\ndifficult to transport.\n    Shipbuilders Association officials told Reuters MHI is the\nworld's largest shipbuilder in terms of orders and capacity.\n    Domestically, MHI is involved in 12 national projects,\nincluding development of nuclear fusion reactors and launch\nvehicles for man-made satellites.\n    It has been the biggest contractor for the Japan Defence\nAgency's F-15 and F-14 jet fighters and missiles, although all\nof these have been built under licence from U.S. Firms.\n    MHI is now heading up five Japanese companies seeking to\ndevelop the country's own fighter plane to replace the\ncurrently used F-1 support fighters in the late 1990s.\n    Military experts said Washington is putting strong pressure\non Tokyo to buy a U.S. Plane, either the McDonnell Douglas Corp\nF-18 or General Dynamics Corp F-16, to reduce Japan's huge\ntrade surplus with the U.S.\n    \"It might be a good idea to jointly produce planes with U.S.\nMakers as Japan is supported by the U.S. Defence umbrella,\" Iida\nsaid.\n    MHI also plans to cooperate with the U.S. In its Strategic\nDefence Initiative space defence program by participating in\nthe project when it moves from the research stage, he said.\n    The U.S. Has been seeking Japan's technological support.\n    In fiscal 1985/86, aircraft accounted for 17.1 pct of MHI's\nsales, shipbuilding 17 pct and power plants 27.9 pct. Iida said\nthe ideal ratio is power plants 30 pct, aircraft and special\nvehicles 25 pct and shipbuilding 15 pct.\n    As for the remaining 30 pct, Iida said he wanted to shift\nthe domestic focus away from heavy machinery sold to\nmanufacturers and towards household goods, but he declined to\nspecify which products.\n    \"By the end of this year, you may find our brand name on\nyour daily products, although this does not mean we will run\naway from our mainstream business,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
