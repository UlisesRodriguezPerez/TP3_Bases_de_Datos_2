        "DATELINE": "    BRUSSELS, March 2 - ",
        "BODY": "The European Community Commission said\nit has opened an enquiry into allegations that the Soviet Union\nis dumping mercury on the European market at below-cost prices.\n    The Commission said its decision follows a complaint from\nEC non-ferrous metals producers that the sales of Soviet\nmercury were harming their business and threatening jobs in the\nEuropean industry.\n    According to the complaint, Soviet mercury sales in the EC\nhad risen from zero in recent years to 100 tonnes between\nAugust and October last year and threaten to capture 25 pct of\nthe EC market if they continue at the same pace.\n    The industry said the mercury was being sold at more than\n40 pct below prices charged by EC producers, forcing them to\ncut their prices to levels that no longer covered costs. The\nimports had caused producers heavy financial losses, it said.\n    The Commission said the industry would probably be unable\nto hold prices at current levels and that any increase would\nresult in loss of sales and jobs.\n    The so-called anti-dumping procedure opened by the\nCommission will allow all interested parties to state their\ncases to the authority.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
