        "TITLE": "TAIWAN CURBS INFLOWS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE",
        "DATELINE": "    TAIPEI, June 2 - ",
        "BODY": "Taiwan's central bank announced that as\nfrom today the overseas foreign exchange borrowings of local\nand foreign banks would be frozen at the level they reached at\nthe end of May.\n    The central bank's statement added that the measure would\nbe effective until the end of July.\n    Bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow of\nforeign exchange and slow the growth of money supply. They\nadded that the move, which sparked a record single day plunge\nof the local stock market, would limit their ability to lend\nforeign exchange to importers and exporters.\n    Foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banks\nreached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April,\naccording to official statistics.\n    Last week the central bank said that from today it would\nreduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40\npct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the move\nwas needed because of \"distortions\" in the foreign exchange\nmarket.\n    Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar,\nhave been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbank\nmarket to avoid exchange rate losses.\n    Official figures show that forward U.S. Dollar sales in May\nreached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs against 5.9\nbillion in April.\n    All Taiwan's foreign exchange earnings must be converted\ninto local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of booming\nexports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct in\nthe year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation.\n    In March the central bank clamped tight restrictions on\nremittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals to\nTaiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money.\n    Economists and bankers estimate that the rising value of\nthe local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S. Dlrs of\nspeculative money into Taiwan since early last year. It has\nflowed in mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S..\n    Since September 1985 the Taiwan dollar has risen by about\n22 pct against the U.S. Dollar.\n    Bankers said the government's efforts to stabilise the\nforeign exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs on\ncapital outflows. The central bank has said the controls will\nbe dropped by the end of July or early August.\n    Foreign exchange dealers said today's announcement caused\njitters in the market with foreign and local banks making heavy\npurchases of U.S. Dollars. They said the central bank sold\nabout 30 mln U.S. Dlrs.\n    Taiwan's stock market plunged a record 75.53 points to\nclose at 1,803.08.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
