        "BODY": "Pigmeat and beef futures, which have\nbeen thinly traded on the London Meat Futures Exchange, LMFE,\ndespite lower physical prices and the introduction of new\ncontracts, need more effective marketing, LMFE chairman Pat\nElmer said in his annual report.\n    In 1986 the Exchange introduced live cattle and pig cash\nsettlement contracts, representing a move away from the\nproblems of cash distortions and squeezes, which initial\ndeliverable \"buyers option\" contracts created, he said.\n    Although the physical industry is aware of the market and\nfollows its prices keenly, this has not been reflected in\nmarket volume, Elmer said.\n    \"If we are to achieve our true potential the floor members\nmust give the market much more time and attention,\" he added.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
