The investment was mainly in\nelectronics, trading, food and service industries.\n    Lee Ming-Yi, deputy director of the ministry's Industrial\nDevelopment and Investment Centre, said the forecast rise is\ndue to planned government incentives and growing willingness\namong Taiwanese to invest abroad.\n    Lee told Reuters the incentives, to be introduced in May or\nJune, include bank loans and a reduction in capitalisation\nrequirements for businesses seeking to invest in the U.S. To 10\nmln Taiwan dlrs from 20 mln.\n    He said the moves to encourage investment in the U.S. Are\npart of Taiwan's efforts to cut its trade surplus with\nWashington, which rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in\n1986 from 1985's 10.2 billion.\n    Taiwanese manufacturers can create jobs for Americans and\navoid import quotas if they set up plants in the U.S., He\nadded.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
