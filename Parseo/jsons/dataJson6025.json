        "BODY": "Minister of Mines Patrick Chitambala\nconfirmed that Zambia had ended copper shipments through South\nAfrica and announced that its state-run mining company had\nclosed down its liaison office in the white-ruled republic.\n    He told the official Times of Zambia newspaper in an\ninterview the government was diverting all mineral exports\nalong rail routes to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and Beira in\nMozambique. Chitambala declined to say what volume of copper\nand other minerals were being shipped through these two ports,\nbut he said there had not been any problem with the new\narrangements.\n    \"So far our copper has been reaching its destinations\nwithout hindrance,\" he told the Times.\n    The Times of Zambia quoted unnamed sources as saying Zambia\nexported 100,000 tonnes of copper through Dar es Salaam and\n17,000 through Beira in the last quarter of 1986. Diplomatic\nsources in Lusaka had earlier expressed doubts over Zambia's\nability to ship all its copper through Beira and Dar es Salaam\nwithout causing massive bottlenecks at the ports.\n    Chitambala also said that the state-run Zambia Consolidated\nCopper Mines (ZCCM) had closed its liaison office in\nJohannesburg, since it was now redundant.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
