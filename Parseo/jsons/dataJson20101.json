        "BODY": "Iran is preparing lawsuits to file for\ncompensation from the U.S. Over the American raid on its Gulf\noil platforms, Tehran radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister\nGholamreza Aqazadeh as saying.\n    The lawsuits would be filed with competent international\nbodies once the exact damage was calculated, he was quoted\ntelling a news conference in Tehran. He earlier estimated the\ndamage from the U.S. Raid at about 500 mln dlrs.\n    The rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four American\ndestroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after\nthe attack, he said.\n    Aqazadeh said the half-billion-dollar damage estimate was\npreliminary. Washington has said the attack was in response to\na missile strike against the American-flag tanker the Sea Isle\nCity in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.\n    He denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs\n\"except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence.\" Reacting to\nWeinberger's remark that Washington considered the case closed,\nAqazadeh said: \"Iran will also consider the case closed after\nits retaliatory measure.\" Iranian officials have said their\nresponse would not be limited to the Gulf and U.S. Interests\naround the world might come under attack.\n    Aqazadeh said the U.S. Military presence in the Gulf\naggravated the regional crisis and made access to the region's\noil more difficult, but he did not see the U.S. Attack\nsignificantly affecting oil prices.\n    IRNA said he gave no explicit reply when asked if the\nattack would prompt Iran to block the Hormuz Strait at the\nentrance to the Gulf.\n    \"If Iran cannot use the Hormuz Strait, no other country can\neither, and this would be to everyone's harm,\" the radio quoted\nhim as saying.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
