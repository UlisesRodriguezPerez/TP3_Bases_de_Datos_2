        "BODY": "Kuwait may re-register part of its\ntanker fleet with foreign flag jurisdictions, including the\nU.S. And USSR, in an attempt to protect them from Iranian\nmissile attacks in the Gulf war zone, U.S. Officials were\nquoted by the New York Times as saying.\n    The transfers would allow the country of registration to\nescort Kuwaiti-owned ships in the Gulf. Kuwait had earlier\ndeclined an offer of U.S. Naval escorts as too public an\nadmission of its need for protection, they said.\n    Kuwait is also looking at flagging-out to European\nregistries, the officials said.\n    Soviet flag tankers transporting Kuwaiti oil through the\nGulf may get Soviet escorts, the officials said.\n    Kuwait had earlier considered having both USSR and U.S.\nEscorts, but the U.S. Was unwilling to give the Soviet Union a\nnaval role in the region, the newspaper quoted the officials as\nsaying.\n    Kuwait has backed Iraq in the seven-year war against Iran\nand its ships have increasingly been the target of Iranian\nattacks.\n    The U.S. And Kuwait have been negotiating for over a month\non methods of protecting Kuwaiti ships.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
