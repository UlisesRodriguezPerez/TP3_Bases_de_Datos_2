        "BODY": "Thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5\nbillion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion a\nyear ago, the Business Economics Department said.\n    It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht\nfrom 58.7 billion. Thailand's improved business climate this\nyear resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials\nand semi-finished products.\n    The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the\nfirst quarter due to lower oil prices.\n    The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6\nbillion baht from 56.6 billion.\n    Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower\nearnings from many key commodities including rice whose\nearnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26\npct and canned pineapples seven pct.\n    Products registering high export growth were jewellery up\n64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
