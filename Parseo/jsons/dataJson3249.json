        "BODY": "The Dutch current account surplus fell\n5.4 billion guilders last year to a provisional 12.1 billion\nguilders, the Finance Ministry said in a statement.\n    The surplus is expected to fall further in 1987, the\nstatement said, but gave no details. Earlier today, the\nofficial planning agency CPB said it expected the surplus to\nfall to six billion guilders during 1987.\n    The visible goods surplus excluding energy fell by 5.6\nbillion guilders in 1986 to 11.4 billion due to declining terms\nof exchange, while more goods were imported as consumer\nspending and investment increased.\n    While the energy trade balance surplus rose by 5.4 billion\nguilders, 4.7 billion of this gain was caused by temporary\nimprovements of terms of exchange and was aided by the delay\nbetween the fall in oil and gas prices.\n    The current account showed a 5.2 billion guilder deficit on\ninvisibles, compared with a balance in 1985, the Finance\nMinistry said, noting the surplus on transport services was\nreduced substantially due to the lower dollar and oil price\nfalls.\n    The fourth quarter current account showed a deficit, for\nthe first time since 1980, of 700 mln guilders, it said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
