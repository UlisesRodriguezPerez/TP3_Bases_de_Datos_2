Under the new\nagreement, Venezula was also able to extend the term from 12 to\n14 years and to lower debt payments in the 1987-89 period by 64\npct.\n    Azpurua said that according to the agreement, the new\ninterest rate will be retroactive to April 1, provided the\naccord is approved before October 1.\n    He told reporters the term sheet detailing the changes in\nthe rescheduling has already been endorsed by the 13-member\ndebt steering committee and is now being sent to the country's\n460 creditor banks for their approval.\n    The new agreement replaces a rescheduling accord signed in\nFebruary 1986, which Venezuela asked to revise to reflect a 45\npct drop in oil revenues.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
