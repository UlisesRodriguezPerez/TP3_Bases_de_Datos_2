        "DATELINE": "    MELBOURNE, March 3 - ",
        "BODY": "Comalco Ltd <CMAC.S> said its return\nto profit reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium\nprices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture.\n    It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the\nyear ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was\nalso aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and\ngreater sales of bauxite and aluminium.\n    Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per\nshare final, dividend delayed until July 1 to take advantage of\nproposed dividend imputation laws.\n    This would make five cents for the year against a first and\nfinal of one cent in 1985.\n    Comalco said the aluminium industry continued to suffer\nfrom low prices and excess capacity, though the weak Australian\ndollar had helped earnings.\n    Withdrawal from the <Showa Aluminium Industries KK> joint\nventure had been recapitalised in expansion by the <New Zealand\nAluminium Smelters Ltd> project with Japan's <Sumitomo\nAluminium Smelting Co Ltd>, permitting repayments and increases\nin liquid funds totalling 165 mln dlrs, it said.\n    As previously reported Comalco's <Commonwealth Aluminium\nCorp> unit has conditionally agreed to sell its smelter at\nGoldendale, Washington, and port facilities at Portland, Oregon\nto <Columbia Aluminium Corp>.\n    Comalco said it had made a 27.3 mln dlr extraordinary\nprovision for Goldendale losses and closure costs but that if\nthe sales agreement were completed it would reduce the\nprovision made in the 1986 accounts.\n    The other items in the total extraordinary loss of 140.5\nmln dlrs were a 102.9 mln write-off of unrealised exchange\nlosses and 10.3 mln for an increase in future tax provision.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
