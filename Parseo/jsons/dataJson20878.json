        "BODY": "Venezuela will back Ecuador's bid to\nraise its OPEC quota above 221,000 barrels per day (bpd)\nbecause it is a justifiable demand, Venezuelan Energy Minister\nArturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday.\n    He told reporters the country deserved a higher quota in\ncompensation for the five months it was forced to suspend oil\nproduction when its main pipeline was destroyed by an\nearthquake last March.\n    \"For this five-month period, Ecuador did not exercise its\nright to produce 221,000 bpd,\" he said. \"We should recognize\nEcuador's right to increase its quota ... There is a basis of\njustice in that country's petition.\"\n    He added however, the quota increase should be gradual to\navoid harming the market, he added.\n    Hernandez Grisanti said he understood Ecuador would\nformally submit the request for a higher quota at the next\nministerial conference of the Organization of Petroleum\nExporting Countries (OPEC) opening December 9 in Vienna.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
