        "BODY": "Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson\ncriticised media coverage of comments he made yesterday, when\nhe was reported as saying he wanted sterling to stay roughly\nwhere it was, specifying a rate of around 2.90 marks and 1.60\ndlrs to the pound.\n    Holding up a newspaper report on his comments headed\n\"Exchange Rate Targets Set\" Lawson told journalists \"This story is\na complete non-event.\"\n    He criticised the report, which said he was now targetting\nsterling against the dollar and mark. \"Nothing of the sort\noccurred,\" Lawson said.\n    Lawson said he had only told National Economic Development\nCouncil panel members what the pound's current dollar/mark\nrates were that day, after saying he was happy with current\nsterling levels. He said he had told the NEDC, a tripartite\nforum of government, unions and industry, that the pound would\nbe kept near its present level by a mixture of interest rates\nand intervention on foreign exchange markets.\n    He then repeated to the panel that he remained satisfed\nwith sterling at around its current levels following the Paris\naccord in February on currency stabilisation.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
