        "BODY": "Kenya's economy will continue to expand\nthis year and the government will do more to encourage\ninvestment by foreign firms and the local private sector,\nPlanning Minister Robert Ouko said.\n    He told a news conference that the government would soon\ncreate a special bureau to expedite processing of investment\napplications by local and foreign investors.\n    Praising the role of multinational companies and local\nentrepreneurs in Kenya's economy, the minister promised to\nmaintain a close working contact with the private sector.\n    The economy grew by 5.3 pct last year, up from 4.1 pct in\n1985, Ouko said. This was owing to high prices for the\ncountry's coffee exports, low oil prices, low inflation and\nrising real incomes, he added.\n    \"Despite rising petroleum prices and falling coffee prices,\nKenya's economy is still expected to improve in 1987,\" the\nplanning minister said.\n    Agriculture would expand significantly if favourable\nweather continued and farmers responded to producer price rises\nannounced in February, the minister added.\n    Kenyan farmers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the\nlong rainy season, which is due to start about now.\n    Ouko said the production of Kenya's main cash crops\nincreased during the second half of last year.\n    Coffee deliveries to the state-run Coffee Board of Kenya\nrose 17 pct and tea deliveries rose four pct during the period,\nhe said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
