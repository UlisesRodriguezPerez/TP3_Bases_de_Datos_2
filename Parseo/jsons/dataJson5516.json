Lerner owns Clevebaco Corp, which is the\ngeneral partner of Clevebaco L.P.\n    The Lerner group said it filed with the Federal Reserve\nBoard on March 13 notice of its intent to buy more than 10 pct\nof the common stock of AmeriTrust, a Cleveland bank holding\ncompany.\n    If the Fed approves, Lerner, whose Equitable Bancorp is\nalso in Cleveland, said he intends to buy more AmeriTrust\nstock, subject to market conditions and other factors.\n    Since Lerner heads a bank holding company with assets\ngreater than one billion dlrs, he said he is barred by law from\nserving as a director or officer of AmeriTrust or of having his\nrepresentatives on its board.\n    Lerner said he has no intention of influencing AmeriTrust\nmanagement or its policies.\n    The group said Clevebaco L.P. bought one mln of its shares\nfrom Bear, Stearns and Co Inc on March 9 at 41 dlrs a share.\n    Lerner said he accumulated the other one mln shares through\nMarch 3 and sold them to Clevebaco L.P., which he controls, on\nMarch 10 for 40.10 dlrs a share.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
