        "TITLE": "REAGAN WARNS CONGRESS ON PROTECTIONISM",
        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, April 26 - ",
        "BODY": "President Reagan warned the U.S.\nCongress in his weekly radio address against passing what he\ncalled dangerous, protectionist trade legislation that would\ntie his hands in trade negotiations with Japan and other\ncountries.\n    Reagan, who will hold talks with Japanese Prime Minister\nYasuhiro Nakasone here this week, said he would lift tariffs\nimposed last week against some Japanese products as soon as\nTokyo complied with a U.S.-Japanese pact on semiconductors.\n    U.S. Officials gave the same message to former Japanese\nForeign Minister Shintaro Abe in meetings in Washington last\nweek.\n    In his weekly radio address on Saturday, Reagan said he\nwould tell Nakasone: \"We want to continue to work cooperatively\non trade problems and want very much to lift these trade\nrestrictions as soon as evidence permits.\n    Reagan said the 100 pct tariffs he imposed on some 300 mln\ndlrs worth of Japanese goods was a special case of trade\nretaliation and did not signal a shift in what he called his\nstaunch anti-protectionist policies.\n    \"In imposing these tariffs we were just trying to deal with\na particular problem, not begin a trade war,\" he said.\n    But Congress is ready to approve tough trade legislation to\ntry to turn round the record U.S. Trade deficit, which has cost\nmillions of U.S. Jobs and closed thousands of factories.\n    A vote on a trade bill sponsored by Congressman Richard\nGephardt is expected to come during Nakasone\"s visit. It would\npenalise nations with large trade surpluses and which are\nalleged to use unfair trade practices.\n    Reagan warned Congress that such action would undercut his\nability to negotiate on trade issues with Nakasone and others.\n    \"With my meeting with Prime Minister Nakasone and the Venice\neconomic summit coming up, it\"s terribly important not to\nrestrict a president\"s options in such trade dealings with\nforeign governments,\" he said.\n    \"Unfortunately, some in the Congress are trying to do\nexactly that,\" he said.\n    Reagan said he would keep the American people \"informed on\nthis dangerous legislation because it\"s just another form of\nprotectionism and I may need your help to stop it.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003"
