        "DATELINE": "    PARIS, March 23 - ",
        "BODY": "A settlement could soon be reached in the\ndispute between European sugar producers and the European\nCommunity over EC export licencing policies, Jean-Marc Vernes,\npresident of French sugar producer Beghin-Say, which is leading\nthe protest, told journalists today.\n    \"Our contacts with the EC authorities over the past few days\nindicate that we are moving towards a solution,\" he said, adding\nthat if this happened the producers would withdraw the 854,000\ntonnes of sugar they have offered into intervention.\n    Vernes said that the protest, involving 770,000 tonnes of\nsugar from French producers alone, was prompted by the EC's\npolicy since mid-1986 of offering export rebates which failed\nto give producers an equivalent price to that they would obtain\nby offering sugar into EC intervention.\n    At last week's tender the EC Commission made an apparent\nconcession by offering a maximum rebate only 1.3 European\ncurrency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos below the level producers\nsay is needed, compared with the previous week's rebate which\nwas 2.5 Ecus below the necessary level.\n    Vernes would not say what form any compromise between the\nproducers and the EC would take, but he reaffirmed the\nlong-term desire of producers to export to the world market,\nproviding they were not losing money by doing so.\n    Producers can withdraw their intervention offer after April\n1, when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores, or\nat any time over the following five weeks before the official\npayment date.\n    The EC has threatened to put the sugar back on the internal\nmarket if the producers refuse to withdraw their offers.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
