        "BODY": "Turkey pulled warships back from close\nescort of its Sismik 1 survey ship as the threat of conflict\nwith Greece over oil rights in the Aegean Sea abated.\n    The semi-official Anatolian Agency said naval vessels ended\ntheir close protection of the ship as it continued work in\nTurkish waters but were following it at a distance.\n    Popular newspapers headlined what they saw as Turkish\nresolve and international pressure forcing Greece to pull back\nfrom planned exploration in disputed international waters.\n    \"Intense United States and NATO efforts bore fruit: Greece\nwill stay in its national waters,\" said the daily Gunes. The\ntop-selling Hurriyet topped its front page with: \"Our resolute\nstand made Greece see reason.\"\n    But two newspapers, Cumhuriyet and Milliyet, noted in\nidentical headlines -- \"Crisis Frozen\" -- that the basic\ndisagreement over exploration rights remained unsolved.\n    The confrontation eased after the Turkish government said\nit had been assured Athens would not begin prospecting in\ndisputed waters.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
