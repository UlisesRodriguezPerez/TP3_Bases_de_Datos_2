        "BODY": "The United States and Japan will\nsoon settle their trade dispute over semiconductors, U.S.\nCommerce secretary Malcolm Baldrige said on television.\n    Baldrige, referring to the U.S.-Japan trade agreement on\nsemiconductors, said: \"Their government wants to live up to it.\nTheir industries haven't been doing it, and I think we'll have\na good settlement to spare both sides.\"\n    \"I think the Japanese understand full well that they haven't\nlived up to this commitment,\" he said.\n    He added: \"I do not think there will be a trade war at all.\"\n    On Friday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300\nmln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods from April 17,\nbecause of Tokyo's failure to observe the agreement.\n    The officials said the tariffs would be ended as soon as\nJapan started adhering to the agreement. But they said there\nwas little chance Japan could react quickly enough to avert the\nhigher tariffs.\n    Baldrige said the Reagan administration hoped the strong\nU.S. Action against Japan would convince Congress to tone down\nprotectionist trade legislation now being drafted.\n    He denied the action had been taken for that reason.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
