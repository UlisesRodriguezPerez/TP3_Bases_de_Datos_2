Dlrs.\n    Renouf managing director Mike Cashin said in a statement it\nhad been Renouf's intention to build up a long-term strategic\nposition in NZI. \"But it became clear to us that it was in the\nbest interests of both NZI and ourselves for Brierley\nInvestments to acquire our holding,\" he said.\n    He said Renouf built up its NZI holding over the past six\nmonths. The sale comprised 74.9 mln shares at 2.725 N.Z. Dlrs a\nshare and 2,095 warrants at 1,709 dlrs each.\n    The warrants are attached to a 150 mln Swiss franc note\nissue. Each bond of 5,000 francs carries a detachable warrant\nentitling the bearer to 2,486 NZI shares.\n    In its 1986 annual report BIL reported that it held a 19\npct stake in NZI.\n    NZI has 673.4 mln ordinary shares on issue. Total capital\nincluding shares attached to warrants is 678.8 mln shares.\n    Cashin said the sale will result in a significant profit\nand places Renouf in a good position to consolidate on recent\ntransactions and pursue other opportunities.\n    NZI shares were at 2.18 N.Z. Dlrs, BIL at 4.08 and Renouf\nat 6.15 at the close of trading.\n    BIL executives were unavailable for comment.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
