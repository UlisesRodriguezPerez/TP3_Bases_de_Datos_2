        "BODY": "Grain trade representatives continued\nto speculate that the Reagan administration will offer\nsubsidized wheat to the Soviet Union, while U.S. Agriculture\nDepartment officials said there was no substance to the\nreports.\n    \"It's pure fiction,\" said one senior official at USDA's\nForeign Agricultural Service, referring to the rumor that the\nadministration would make an export enhancement offer to Moscow\nin the next two to three weeks.\n    An aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who asked not\nto be identified said there was nothing to substantiate the\nspeculation, which he said was started by \"somebody fanning the\n(wheat) market.\" Wheat futures strengthened today, partly on the\nbasis of the speculation.\n    One lobbyist with close connections to the Reagan\nadministration said a Soviet trade team told private grain\ntrade officials in New York last week that Moscow would buy as\nmuch as four mln tonnes of U.S. wheat, much of it before\nmid-year, if it was \"competitively priced.\"\n    Alexander Ivlev, an official with Amtorg, a Soviet trading\norganization, told Reuters he had no information to\nsubstantiate the rumors of an imminent wheat subsidy offer, but\nsaid that Moscow \"would consider\" buying U.S. wheat if it was\ncompetitively priced.\n    \"We don't care if it is EEP, what we (the Soviets) are\nlooking for is competitive prices,\" Ivlev said. \"If they (the\nadministration) are interested in selling it (wheat), they\nshould find ways to do it.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
