        "BODY": "Seven major U.S. farm groups took\nthe unusual step of releasing a joint statement urging\ncongressional leaders not to tinker with existing farm law.\n    Following meetings with House Agriculture Committee\nChairman Kika de la Garza (D-Tex.) and Senate Agriculture\nCommittee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the groups issued a\nstatement saying lawmakers should \"resist efforts to overhaul\nthe 15-month-old law, which is operating in its first crop\nmarketing year.\"\n    The farm groups included the American Farm Bureau\nFederation, American Soybean Association, National Cattlemen's\nAssociation, National Corn Growers Association, National Cotton\nCouncil, National Pork Producers Council and the U.S. Rice\nProducers Legislative Group.\n    The statement said Congress should not modify the 1985 farm\nbill \"so the law might have its intended impact of making\nagriculture more competitive in export markets while at the\nsame time maintaining farm income.\"\n    \"We strongly believe American farmers now need\npredictability and certainty in farm legislation in order to\nhave any opportunity of making proper production and marketing\ndecisions,\" the groups said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
