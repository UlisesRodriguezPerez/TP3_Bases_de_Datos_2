        "BODY": "Time Inc said the acquisition of Scott,\nForesman and Co last year will dilute earnings per share by\nabout 17 cts a share for the full year in 1987.\n    For the first quarter the acquisition will have a negative\nimpact of about 20 cts per share, chief financial officer\nThayer Bigelow told security analysts.\n    He said Scott, Foresman, a textbook publisher, will\ncontribute more than 50 mln dlrs in operating income before\ndepreciation and amortization for the full year.\n    N.J. Nicholas, president and chief operating officer, said\nSoctt Foresman will have over 200 mln dlrs in revenue in 1987.\n    Bigelow said the textbook business, which normally has its\nhighest profit in the third quarter and incurs a loss in the\nfirst quarter, will have an \"adverse impact of 15 mln dlrs' on\nbook publishing income for the first quarter.\n    \"First quarter performance for the rest of Time Inc will be\nbetter than last year,\" Bigelow said.\n    The dilution of 17 cts per share for 1987 includes the\neffects of financing the acquisition. Bigelow also said the\ncompany is \"comfortable\" with estimates that earnings will be\nbetween 3.75 dlrs and 4.25 dlrs per share for the year.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
