        "BODY": "International Coffee Organization, ICO,\nproducers will meet at 1500 GMT (0900 est) for a general\ndiscussion of the market situation, producer spokesman\nLindenberg Sette said.\n    The Brazilian delegate said several producers requested the\nmeeting but Brazil was not among them. The ICO executive\nboard's regular session this week has so far been confined to\nroutine matters, with no attempt by producers or consumers to\nrevive export quota negotiations, delegates said.\n    Talks to restore quotas collapsed early last month when\nproducers and consumers failed to resolve differences on how\nquotas should be allocated.\n    Producer delegates said there was no sense of urgency among\nproducers to reopen quota talks with consumers, with most\ncountries now prepared to wait for the ICO's annual September\ncouncil session to restart negotiations.\n    Members of the Inter-African Coffee Organization called for\ntoday's producer meeting to exchange views on the market\nsituation, the producer delegates said.\n    The lack of a new debate on export quotas here this week\nwas cited as the reason for renewed weakness in coffee prices\nin London and New York futures, traders said.\n    Near May in London hit a five-year low this morning at\n1,220 stg, about 50 stg below last night's close, they said.\n    The executive board session looks set to end today,\nfollowing a final session at 1600 GMT (1000 est) when a\nconsultancy report of the operation of the ICO will be\npresented to producers and consumers, delegates added.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
