        "BODY": "Former Treasury official C. Fred\nBergsten said a new exchange rate system is needed to replace\nthe fixed and flexible exchange rate systems which he said had\nnot worked.\n    \"I prefer a move to 'target zones' in which the major\ncountries would determine ranges of 15-20 pct within which they\nwould pledge to hold their exchange rates by direct\nintervention and, as necessary, by changes in monetary and\nother policies,\" Bergsten, now the director of the Institute\nfor International Economics, said in a statement to a House\nBanking subcommittee.\n    \"The substantial correction of the exchange rate that has\noccurred since early 1985 is enormously welcome, and should\nproduce a sizeable reduction in the U.S. trade deficit this\nyear and next, but the imbalance will not fall much below 100\nbillion dlrs on present policies, so much more is needed,\" he\nsaid.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
