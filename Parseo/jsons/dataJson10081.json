        "BODY": "Federal Reserve Board governor Robert\nHeller said that the dollar's current level is appropriate but\ndeclined to comment on widespread market reports of concerted\ncentral bank intervention this week.\n    \"The dollar is stable again... The current level is the\nappropriate level,\" Heller told reporters after a speech to a\nmeeting of financial services analysts.\n    He said last month's six-nation currency accord in Paris\ndid not include target ranges for the dollar in an \"academic\nway.\"\n    Heller also said that it was too early to determine whether\nthe parties to the six-nation accord were taking appropriate\nsteps to carry out the longer-term economic adjustments agreed\nto in Paris.\n    \"Clearly, they've not been implemented yet... No one\nexpects implementation within a week or two,\" he said.\n    Earlier today, U.S. Treasury assistant secretary told a\nSenate banking subcommittee that he did not believe that West\nGermany and Japan have yet carried out their international\nresponsibilities.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
