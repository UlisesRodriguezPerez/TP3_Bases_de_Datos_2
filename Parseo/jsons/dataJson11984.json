        "BODY": "U.S. Trade Representative Clayton\nYeutter said the United States and Argentina have settled a \ncase brought by the U.S. soybean crushing industry alleging\nunfair subsidies to Argentina's crushing industry.\n    Speaking to an Agribusiness Education forum here late\nyesterday, Yeutter said the case was resolved at a meeting with\nArgentine Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figuerras during a\ntrade ministers' meeting in New Zealand last week.\n    Under a verbal understanding between the two ministers,\nArgentina will soon abolish export taxes on soybeans and\nproducts, U.S. and Argentine officials said.\n    The U.S. case brought by the U.S. National Soybean\nProcessors Association alleged Argentina, through differential\nexport taxes, implicitly subsidized domestic soybean crushers.\n    The U.S. crushing industry, in its complaint under Section\n301 of trade law, said higher Argentine export taxes on\nsoybeans than on products encourage the export of products and\nrepresented an unfair trade practice.\n    Yeutter told Figuerras that all agencies of the U.S.\ngovernment supported the U.S. complaint and unless Argentina\ntook steps to eliminate the taxes, the United States would\nconsider taking further action in the case, U.S. and Argentine\nofficials said.\n    An Argentine official here said no timetable was given for\nremoval of the Argentine export taxes.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
