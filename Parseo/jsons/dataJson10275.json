        "BODY": "Four major Japanese steelmakers plan to\nform a seamless pipe export cartel for markets other than the\nU.S. And the European Community for a year from April to keep\nprices above output costs, company officials involved said.\n    The companies are Nippon steel Corp <NSTC.T>, Sumitomo\nMetal Industries Ltd <SMIT.T>, Nippon Kokan KK <NKKT.T> and\nKawasaki Steel Corp <KAWS.T>, which together account for some\n95 pct of Japan's total seamless pipe exports.\n    The firms will apply to form the cartel to the Ministry of\nInternational Trade and Industry today and approval is expected\nlater this month, the officials said.\n    Under the plan, the four companies will set floor prices\nfor exports as prices have fallen sharply due to the yen's\nappreciation against the dollar, reduced world demand caused by\nlower oil prices and excess domestic capacity which resulted in\nprice-cutting competition, the officials said.\n    In calendar 1986, seamless pipe exports fell to 2.34 mln\ntonnes from 2.99 mln in 1985 and 3.12 mln in 1981.\n    The officials declined to give any idea of floor prices,\nsaying it depends partly on volume, but industry sources\nestimate average export prices would rise by around 20 pct to\nsome 800 dlrs a tonne.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
