        "BODY": "The official Soviet news agency Tass\ndenounced a U.S. Attack on an Iranian oil-drilling platform in\nthe Gulf on Monday as military adventurism and said it would\nbring no dividends to the Reagan administration.\n    Tass commentator Mikhail Krutikhin said the administration\nhad embarked on an adventurist path in order to deflect\nattention from the scandal in which the United States sold arms\nto Iran and the profits were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels.\n    \"The confrontation is a fact now. What is obvious is that\nthe latest military adventure will not bring political\ndividends to the American administration,\" Krutikhin said.\n    Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard\nShevardnadze abruptly left a parliamentary session earlier on\nMonday, sparking diplomatic speculation that they were\nconcerned with an urgent matter of foreign affairs.\n    Soviet officials have previously criticized the United\nStates for sending naval forces into the Gulf, saying their\npresence serves to increase tension.\n    Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran and\nIraq. It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also sought\nbroader contacts with Iran in the last year.\n    Krutikhin said: \"The United States has undertaken an act of\narmed aggression against Iran, the probability of which has\nlong been spoken of by Washington officials.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
