        "BODY": "Ministry of International Trade and\nIndustry (MITI) Vice Minister Makoto Kuroda leaves for\nWashington today with data he hopes will refute U.S. Charges\nJapan has violated a pact on microchip trade.\n    A three-man Japanese trade team is already in Washington\nlaying the groundwork for talks between Kuroda and Deputy U.S.\nTrade Representative Michael Smith aimed at persuading the U.S.\nNot to impose tariffs on certain Japanese products.\n    But Kuroda said he is taking no new proposals. \"I have\nnothing in my briefcase except an explanation of the current\nsituation,\" Kuroda told the daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun.\n    Kuroda said the U.S. Decision was based on incorrect data\nand an exaggerated sense of MITI's power to control market\nforces. \"The U.S. Has excessive expectations. To stabilise\nsupply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess\ninventories since 1985 will take some time,\" he said.\n    Kuroda also laid part of the blame for low U.S. Chip sales\nin Japan on a lack of effort by American firms here.\n    He said if he fails in talks tomorrow and Friday to\nforestall sanctions, he will seek further talks with U.S. Trade\nRepresentative Clayton Yeutter. U.S. Officials said this week's\ntalks are unlikely to delay imposition of tariffs.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
