        "BODY": "Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger has\nordered the U.S. Navy to increase its presence near the Gulf in\nan effort to fulfil President Reagan's pledge to keep oil\nflowing to Europe and Japan, The New York Times reported.\n    The newspaper quoted Pentagon officials as saying the Navy\nwould keep the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk on station in the\nArabian Sea and the rest of the Indian Ocean until May, three\nmonths longer than planned.\n    The Navy would then have a carrier battle group of six to\neight warships in the area at all times rather than part of the\ntime, as happens now, the paper said.\n    The paper said that last month U.S. Intelligence sources\nsaid they had spotted land-based anti-ship missiles of a\nChinese design known in the West as the HY-2 near the Strait of\nHormuz.\n    It said their purpose was seen as a signal Iran was ready\nto continue and perhaps step up the Gulf shipping war against\nIraq.\n    U.S. Carriers or battleships would sail out of range of\nthose missiles, but within striking distance, the paper quoted\nofficials as saying.\n    From several hundred miles at sea, carriers could launch\naircraft bombing runs or missile strikes, and battleships could\nfire long-range missiles, the paper said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
