        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, MARCH 20 - ",
        "BODY": "The stock of McDonald's Corp rose\nsharply this morning after analyst Daniel Lee of Drexel Burnham\nLambert Inc reiterated his recommendation of the stock, traders\nsaid.\n    McDonald's, an operator of fast food restaurants, rose\n1-5/8 to 77-3/8.\n    \"Comparable store sales are up 5.6 pct in 1986 vs 1985,\"\nLee said, \"and the stock is trading below the market multiple.\"\nHe said \"not many companies have a consistent 15 pct annual\nearnings growth rate, return on equity above 20 pct, but trade\nat less than the market multiple.\"\n    Analyst Lee said \"the introduction of a new line of salads\nthis spring, at about the time we are all trying to squeeze\ninto bathing suits, should boost sales.\"\n    He also noted that \"the average McDonald's does about 1.369\nmln dlrs in revenues a year. That compares with 1.1 mln dlrs a\nyear for the average Burger King and 800,000 dlrs a year for\nthe average Wendy's.\" Since it cost about the same to build a\nsingle store for any one of these chains, he said, \"McDonald's\ncan well justify their expansion.\"\n    Lee expects McDonald's to earn 4.40 dlrs a share in 1986\nand 5.15 dlrs in 1988. Last year it earned 3.72 dlrs a share.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
