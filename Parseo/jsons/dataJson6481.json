        "TITLE": "VW'S AUDI SAYS PROFIT FELL AROUND 50 PCT IN 1986",
        "DATELINE": "    MUNICH, March 18 - ",
        "BODY": "Audi AG <NSUG.F>, the 99 pct owned\nsubsidiary of Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, said profit in 1986 fell\nby around half compared with 1985, when it achieved a record\n221 mln marks net profit, a rise of 19.5 pct on the previous\nyear.\n    Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a news\nconference he expected both profit and turnover to rise this\nyear compared with 1986, but he said it was questionable\nwhether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels.\n    He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted last\nyear that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecified\namount from 1985's record levels.\n    Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from\n9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10\nbillion this year.\n    Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help the\nparent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audi\nwould ensure VW got a share of profits.\n    Audi's entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own free\nreserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 years\nVW had received 80 pct of Audi's earnings as a dividend.\n    Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to output\ncaused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, on\ncurrency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. About\nalleged \"sudden acceleration\" of some of its Audi 5000 models.\n    As reported, Audi's sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pct\nto 59,800 last year.\n    Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottom\nout in 1987.\n    Audi's worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000.\n    Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000,\nbut domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180\nin 1985.\n    Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in the\nfirst two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overall\nmarket share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in the\nsame months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Sales\nfell further, he said without giving details. Worldwide\ndeliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to\n57,000.\n    Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise to\nover 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallen\ncompared with 1985's 392,000.\n    Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead to\nfurther new hiring of employees.\n    At the end of 1986 Audi's workforce stood at a record\n39,800, a rise of 3,400 over 1985.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
