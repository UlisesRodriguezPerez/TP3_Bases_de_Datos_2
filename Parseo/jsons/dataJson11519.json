        "BODY": "U.S. Agriculture Undersecretary\nDaniel Amstutz said he was \"totally sympathetic\" with U.S. wood\nproducers' desire to have their exports eligible for government\ncredit guarantees.\n    But he told the Senate Appropriations Agriculture\nsubcommittee that including wood products in the department's\nshort- or intermediate-term export guarantee programs would\nconflict with U.S. multilateral trade obligations.\n    Currently, U.S. wood products are not eligible for\ngovernment export credit guarantee because they are considered\n\"manufactured products,\" Amstutz said.\n    He said USDA had devoted an \"enormous amount\" of time to\nconsidering making wood products eligible for the guarantees\nand that Congress was considering a measure to do so.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
