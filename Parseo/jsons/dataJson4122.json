        "DATELINE": "    KUALA LUMPUR, March 12 - ",
        "BODY": "The tin price is likely to rise to\n20 ringgit a kilo this year because of the producers' accord on\nexport quotas and the reluctance of brokers and banks to sell\nthe metal at lower prices, a Malaysian government bulletin\nsaid.\n    The Malaysian Tin bulletin said it is in producers'\ninterest to keep to their quotas to limit total exports to\n90,000 tonnes and to gradually deplete the 80,000 tonnes\noverhang.\n    It said consumption by industrialised countries should stay\nat 160,000 tonnes and that International Tin Council creditors\nand brokers are not likely to dump their stocks excessively\nunless there is a large and abrupt price jump.\n    The continued depreciation of the dollar could also help\npush up the price of tin, the bulletin said.\n    A depreciation of the dollar means the depreciation of the\nringgit which is closely pegged to it, making the price of tin\ncheaper in sterling terms, it added.\n    \"Even in the absence of economic rationale in the tin\nmarket, psychological optimism alone is sufficient to secure a\nprice recovery of up to 20 ringgit per kilo,\" the bulletin said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
