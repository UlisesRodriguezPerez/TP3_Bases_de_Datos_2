        "BODY": "Energy Secretary John Herrington told\nCongress that a federally chartered corporation would be the\nbest way to manage and operate the government's uranium\nenrichment program.\n    He said in a letter to Congressmen that unless the program,\nnow run by the Energy Department, is improved, sales worth five\nbillion dlrs could be lost between 1990 and 2000.\n    The program now has annual commercial sales of about one\nbillion dlrs and holds 50 pct of the free world market for\nenrichment services.\n    A department official said the world market for enriched\nuranium for reactors for power utilities is increasingly\ncompetitive and private entity could better tap it.\n    The Administration's plan to spin off the department's \nuranium enrichment operation is in line with it effort to\nreduce the federal government's role in areas where it feels\nprivate enterprise could be more efficient.\n reuter\n\u0003"
