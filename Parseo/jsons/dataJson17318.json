        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, April 27 - ",
        "BODY": "The Zeebrugge ferry disaster, in which\naround 200 people drowned seven weeks ago, was almost certainly\ncaused by the ship leaving port with its bow doors wide open, a\nBritish government inquiry was told.\n    Lawyer David Steel, representing the government, told the\nopening session of a public inquiry into the March 6 tragedy\nthat this was \"the only tenable explanation.\"\n    The ferry, the Herald of Free Enterprise, is owned by\nTownsend Thoresen, part of P and O's <PORL.L> subsidiary\nEuropean Ferries Group.\n    Steel, commissioner of wrecks for England and Wales, said\nthe inquiry would probably conclude that the ferry capsized in\ncalm seas and fair weather a mile outside the Belgian port when\nwater poured into the car deck.\n    \"We think you will also conclude that the immediate cause of\nthat was that the doors were open, he said.\n    Steel told the tribunal it appeared no attempt was made to\nclose either the inner or outer bow doors prior to what should\nhave been a routine voyage to the English port of Dover,\ndespite a provision in the ship's \"Stability Booklet\" that the\ndoors were to be closed and kept closed.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
