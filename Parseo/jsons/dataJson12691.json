        "BODY": "The Environmental Protection Agency\nproposed rules to shield water supplies from potential leaks\nfrom 1.4 mln underground storage tanks, nearly half of which\nare used to store gasoline at service stations.\n    It said the rules would require owners and operators of the\ntanks containing petroleum products or certain hazardous\nchemicals to monitor the tanks for leaks and, in case of leaks,\nto notify appropriate authorities.\n    The owners and operators of petroleum tanks would also be\nfinancially responsible for any contamination, the EPA said.\n    It said financial requirements for chemical tanks will be\nproposed later.\n    Hazardous tanks are regulated separately.\n    EPA Administrator Lee Thomas said \"Thousands of underground\nstorage tanks are currently leaking and, without adequate\ncontrols, many more can be expected to leak in the future,\nendangering our nation's drinking-water supplies.\"\n    He added in a statement \"We intend to ensure that each\nunderground tank is either upgraded or closed down and that\nsafe operating and cleanup procedures are following to provide\nmaximum protection from any future leaks.\"\n reuter\n\u0003"
