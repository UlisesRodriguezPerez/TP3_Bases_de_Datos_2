        "BODY": "<Spar Aerospace Ltd>, reporting a\nsharply lower 1986 profit, said it anticipated solid profit and\nrevenue growth during the next five years.\n    \"Looking to the longer term, Spar is confident that its\ncontinuing concentration on advanced robotics, satellite-based\ncommunications and electro-optical defense systems will lead to\nsignificant growth in revenues and earnings over the next five\nyears,\" the company said.\n    It also forecast higher 1987 sales due to an increased\norder backlog. Revenues last year fell to 191 mln dlrs from\n223.3 mln while profit fell to 4.4 mln dlrs from 13.1 mln.\n    Spar added that lower development costs in the\ncommunications group and a return to normal operations in gears\nand transmissions and aviation services \"will remove a serious\ndrain on profits\" this year.\n    It attributed its reduced 1986 earnings to communications\ngroup losses resulting from continued heavy investment in new\nproducts and market development, a four-month strike at its\nToronto plants and delays in receipt of authorization from\ncustomers to start work on new programs.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
