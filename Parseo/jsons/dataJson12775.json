        "BODY": "A Swedish Finance Ministry committee\nforecast that British Petroleum Plc <BP.L> may have to close\nits refinery in Gothenburg because of an anticipated worsening\nof the Swedish petroleum industry's competitiveness.\n    It said in a report that the future of the Swedish refining\nbusiness was bleak due to the steady drop in domestic oil\nconsumption since the mid-1970s, a possible tightening of rules\non sulphur content and competition from Norway's Mongstad\nfacility of <Den Norske Stats Olieselskab> (Statoil) <STAT.OL>\nwhen its expansion is completed in the 1990s.\n    The committee said the BP refinery, which lacks a\nde-sulphurisation plant, was likely to be closed or sold unless\ncostly investments were made to enhance the facility's capacity\nto refine a broader range of products.\n    But the committee noted that capacity utilisation had in\nrecent years been above that of the European refining industry\non average. The BP plant, in which Sweden's state-owned <OK\nPetroleum AB> has a 22 pct, started up in 1967 and has an\nannual capacity of 4.7 mln tonnes.\n    There was nobody at British Petroleum immediately available\nfor comment.\n\u0003"
