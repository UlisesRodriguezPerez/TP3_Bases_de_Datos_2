        "BODY": "Ohio Edison Co said it has\ncompleted the sale and leaseback of 30 pct of its 30 pct\ninterest in Unit One of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant,\nreceiving 509 mln dlrs for the interest.\n    The utility said the share of its interest in the 1,205\nmegawatt generating plant was sold to a group of institutional\ninvestors which leased it back to the company for a period of\nabout 29 years at a negotiated lease payment rate.\n    Ohio Edison said the proceeds will be used to finance the\nrest of its 1987 construction program and repay bank loans\nincurred for the retirement of high-interest long-term debt.\n    Ohio Edison did not detail the lease payments, but it said\nthe \"payments will reduce the amount of revenue the company\nwill need to cover our investment in Perry, which translates\ninto savings for our customers.\"\n    The utility said it projects the financing could reduce the\namount of annual revenue needed by about 20 mln dlrs. It plans\non filing a rate application with the Public Utilities\nCommission of Ohio to recover the Perry costs later this year.\n    It said the sale and leaseback was attractive to the\ninvestors because they could take quicker advantage of tax\nbenefits than the utility could.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
