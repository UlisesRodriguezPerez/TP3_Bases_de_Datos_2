        "BODY": "Federal Reserve Board\nChairman Paul Volcker said the U.S. Trade deficit is a\nchallenge for the U.S. Equal to the Soviet Union launching of\nSputnik.\n    \"The international challenge implicit in our huge trade\ndeficit has become the 1980s equivalent to the launch of\nSputnik by the Russians in the 1950s, when we suddenly feared\nwe were to be left in the wake of Soviet technological\nachievement,\" he said in an address to Florida educators.\n     He said the trade problem underscored the need to reform\nthe U.S. Educational system to improve economic performance.\n    The Commerce Department reported last week that the\nnation's trade gap, calculated on a balance-of-payments basis,\nswelled to a record 38.37 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter,\nbringing the 1986 deficit to a record 147.71 billion dlrs.\n    Volcker called on educators to stress the development of\nbasic reading, writing and mathematics skills and urged them to\nhelp students adapt to the fast-changing economic climate.\n    Volcker said the challenge was greatest in the education of\nlow-income minority groups such as blacks and Hispanics.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
