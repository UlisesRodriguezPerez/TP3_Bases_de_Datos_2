        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 4 - ",
        "BODY": "Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said he\nintended to offer legislation that would allow 1987 producers\nof wheat, feedgrains, cotton and rice to receive at least 92\npct of their deficiency payments, regardless of how much they\nplanted.\n    Boschwitz told the Senate Agriculture Committee that\napplying the so-called 0/92 provision to 1987 crops was\nsupported by the Reagan administration and would save\napproximately 500 mln dlrs, including 266 mln dlrs in corn\npayments, 90 mln dlrs in wheat and 30 mln dlrs in cotton.\n    The Minnesota senator said he might offer the bill on the\nSenate floor or in a conference committee with the House of\nRepresentatives in the event a similar bill before the House\nAgriculture Committee is approved by that body.\n    Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the U.S.\nAgriculture Department had decided whether or how deficiency\npayments should be guaranteed to farmers who might choose not\nto plant under the decoupling scheme.\n    If payments are not set in advance under decoupling, market\nprices conceivably could rise, thereby leading to diminished\ndeficiency payments.\n    Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,\nsaid he wanted to go to conference with the House as soon as\npossible on the issue, but would have to study the matter\nfurther before deciding how he would vote on it.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
