        "BODY": "Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corp\nLtd said it expects 1987 earnings will be lower than last\nyear's previously reported 85 cts a share.\n    But profits \"will be at a satisfactory level,\" the company\nsaid in the annual report without giving a specific estimate.\n    Highveld said it expects appreciation of the rand will be\noffset to some extent by increasing U.S. Dollar prices for its\nexports as the year progresses.\n    Highveld said measures taken last year by the European\nEconomic Community and the United States prohibiting all South\nAfrican steel products \"presents a challenge to management to\nplace the steel in other areas.\"\n    The company said overall world vanadium consumption in 1987\nis expected to be similar to last year although China's role is\nstill an unknown factor in the total supply-demand situation.\n    \"World vanadium production capacity is still believed to be\nadequate to cater for any foreseeable demand,\" it added.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
