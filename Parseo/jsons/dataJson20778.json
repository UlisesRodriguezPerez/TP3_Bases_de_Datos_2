No one was wounded and there were no losses.\"\n    Diplomats said shells from the nearby Iran-Iraq warfront\nhad in the past fallen in the northern Kuwaiti desert.\n    A senior Kuwait Petroleum Corporation official had earlier\ntold Reuters he was unaware of any attack against Kuwaiti oil\ninstallations.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
