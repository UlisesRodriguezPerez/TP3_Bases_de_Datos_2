        "DATELINE": "    DUESSELDORF, April 2 - ",
        "BODY": "Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale\n<WELG.F> said its wholly-owned Luxembourg subsidiary WestLB\nInternational SA posted a decline in 1986 net profit to 12.6\nmln marks from 48.5 mln a year earlier.\n    WestLB International will pay a 12.5 mln mark dividend to\nWestLB, down from 47.7 mln a year earlier.\n    The dividend was lower than in 1985 because the record\nprofit of the previous year could not be repeated, due to\nchanged market conditions, it said. Increased funds were also\nallocated for provisions. Business in the first three months of\n1987 developed positively, it added.\n    WestLB International set aside 115.3 mln marks for\ninternational credit risks in 1986, up from 97.4 mln marks in\n1985, bringing the total amount of provisions shown in the\nbalance sheet to 580.3 mln marks.\n    Operating profit fell to 122 mln marks in 1986 from 150 mln\nin 1985. Balance sheet total fell to 9.7 billion marks from\n10.8 billion, reflecting the lower dollar and the fact that\ncredit business redemptions were not fully offset by new\nlending.\n    The statement said WestLB International's business with\nprivate customers showed a pleasing expansion last year.\n    This development was aided by cooperation between the bank\nand the savings banks in the West German state of North\nRhine-Westphalia, where parent bank WestLB is based.\n    Deposits by non-banks rose more than 40 pct to a total of\n1.1 billion.\n    WestLB International said it plans to expand its range of\nservices for private clients.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
