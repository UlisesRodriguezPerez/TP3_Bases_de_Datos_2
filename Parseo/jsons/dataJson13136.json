        "BODY": "Scott Instruments Corp said its\nindependent public accountants qualified the report on Scott's\n1986 financial statements because of its weak financial\ncondition.\n    The report indicates the realization of the company's\nassets is dependent on it obtaining enough working capital to\nfinance operations and additional funds to meet other\nliabilities, among other things.\n    These factors indicate the company may be unable to\ncontinue its existence.\n    Earlier, Scott reported a 1986 loss of 1.9 mln dlrs\ncompared to a loss of almost 2.2 mln dlrs in 1985. Total assets\nwere nearly 1.1 mln dlrs at year end, down from 1.2 mln dlrs\nthe prior year.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
