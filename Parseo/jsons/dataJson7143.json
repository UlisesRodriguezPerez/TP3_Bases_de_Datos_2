        "BODY": "Madagascar's available coffee\noutput is estimated at 80,725 tonnes this year, down from\n82,210 in 1986, due to a rundown of government agricultural\nservices and the poor state of feeder roads in rural areas,\nAgriculture Ministry sources said.\n    This is after accounting for the loss of some 15,000 to\n20,000 tonnes due to the transport problems in the countryside,\nthey said.\n    The sources did not give an estimate for exports in 1987,\nbut they noted that shipments declined to 37,200 tonnes last\nyear from 41,662 in 1985.\n    Low yields from the country's ageing coffee plantations and\nprevalence of the fungal disease Hemileia Vastatrix also\ncontributed to the poor performance, the sources said.\n    They pointed out that 52 pct of Madagascar's coffee bushes\nwere planted before 1930.\n    The sources said Madagascar was still a long way from\nreaching the production target of 110,000 tonnes per year and\nthe export target of 63,000 tonnes outlined in the government's\n1986-1990 five-year plan.\n    In order to reverse the decline in coffee production, the\ngovernment has decided to plant 20,000 hectares with\nhigh-yielding arabica and canephora varieties, the sources\nsaid.\n    The planting programme will begin this year and is aimed at\nproducing 300 to 360 kilos per hectare of beans with a low\ncaffeine content.\n    The sources added that Madagascar's plan to export roasted\ncoffee has failed to take off due to packaging problems. Only\n650 tonnes of roasted coffee were exported last year.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
