        "BODY": "Kuwait\"s Oil Minister, in remarks\npublished today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC\nmeeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world\noil prices.\n    Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local\ndaily al-Qabas as saying: \"None of the OPEC members has asked\nfor such a meeting.\"\n    He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000\nbarrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production\nlimits of the 13-nation organisation.\n    Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate\nOPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln\nbpd agreed in Geneva last December.\n    They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with\nthe much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above\nquota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.\n    \"This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said\nKuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that\nbecause Kuwait has the ability, it will do so,\" the minister\nsaid.\n    Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to\nproduce up to 4.0 mln bpd.\n    \"If we can sell more than our quota at official prices,\nwhile some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their\nshare, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever,\" he said.\n    He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar,\nwhich industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd\nof its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting\nofficial prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker\nof 18 dlrs per barrel.\n    Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels\nthis year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of\n19 dollars a barrel.\n    Sheikh Ali also delivered \"a challenge to any international\noil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices.\"\n    Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a\nbarrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate.\n    However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because\nof its local and international refining facilities and its own\ndistribution network abroad, he added.\n    He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC\"s\ndifferentials committee has been postponed until the start of\nApril at the request of certain of the body\"s members.\n    Ecuador\"s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said\nlast Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign\na lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at\ntalks this month of opec\"s pricing committee.\n    Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, in\napparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: \"We\nexpected such pressure. It will continue through March and\nApril.\" But he expected the situation would later improve.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
