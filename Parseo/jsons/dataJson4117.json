        "BODY": "Hungary is to grow sugar beet on\n105,000 hectares of land this year compared with some 95,000 in\n1986, the official MTI news agency said.\n    Diplomats said this reflected Hungary's policy of keeping\nthe sugar beet area stable under the current five-year plan\n(1985-89) and producing enough to cover only domestic demand\ndespite the recent rise of world prices to 10 month highs.\n    Drought cut the 1986 harvest to 3.58 mln tonnes from 4.07\nmln in 1985. But a record yield of 130 kilos per tonne of beet\nkept production at 454,000 tonnes, with 30,000 extra refined in\nYugoslavia from Hungarian beet. Output was 483,000 in 1985.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
