        "TITLE": "SHULTZ WELCOMES TOKYO ECONOMIC PACKAGE",
        "DATELINE": "    ROME, June 2 - ",
        "BODY": "U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said\nthe 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Tokyo last\nweek went further than the U.S. Had expected.\n    But he said the U.S. Would not lift the selective economic\nsanctions it imposed on Japanese imports in April until Tokyo\nchanged its sales policies concerning computer microchips.\n    Speaking in a televised news conference linking several\nEuropean capitals, Shultz said it was heartening that the\nJapanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and\nglobal demand.\n\n    \"There is an even greater amount of stimulus than was\noriginally thought,\" said Shultz, speaking from Washington.\n    \"It is a lot more than nothing. It is more than was talked\nabout when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here.\n    \"It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe\nthat getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the\neconomy,\" he added.\n    But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the news\nconference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Might\ndecide at next week's Venice summit to lift its sanctions on\nsome Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied:\n    \"These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an\nagreement that had been reached between the United States and\nJapan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip\nmarket.\n    \"They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to the\nagreement that it made become evident.\"\n    He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor the\nsituation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a\ntrend on only one month's data.\n    The U.S. Imposed 100 pct import duties on personal\ncomputers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging that\nJapan had violated last September's bilateral agreement by\nselling computer chips at below fair market value.\n    Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also do\nwell to look at what they could do to stimulate demand.\n    Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies to\ntake action to stimulate the world economy without a bold\nAmerican initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget\ndeficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the\nproblem.\n    He said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit\nwould probably be reduced by around 35 billion dlrs against\nlast year, and that the budget being worked on this year would\ncontain a major reduction.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
