        "TITLE": "BHP SEES STRONG FOURTH QUARTER BUT LOWER YEAR NET",
        "DATELINE": "    MELBOURNE, March 27 - ",
        "BODY": "The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S>\nsaid it expects a strong full year result, helped by sigificant\ninvestment allowance credits in the fourth quarter, but net\nwill fall short of the record 988.2 mln dlrs earned in 1985/86\nended May 31.\n    The group earlier reported its net earnings dropped to\n603.0 mln dlrs in the first three quarters ended February 28\nfrom 813.0 mln a year earlier.\n    Third quarter net fell to 206.0 mln dlrs from 238.6 mln a\nyear earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter ended November\n31, BHP said in a statement.\n    Earnings in the first nine months were at the lower end of\nshare analysts' forecasts yesterday of a range of 600 mln to\n620 mln dlrs.\n    BHP held its annual dividend unchanged at 37.5 cents after\ndeclaring a steady final dividend of 20 cents and announced a\none-for-five bonus issue to shareholders registered May 1.\n    The bonus is being made from reserves which will not\nqualify for tax-free distribution after the introduction of\ndividend imputation next July 1.\n    The bonus shares will not rank for the final dividend, BHP\nsaid.\n    BHP said it should not be expected that the present rate of\ndividend will be maintained on the increased capital.\n    The level of future dividends will be influenced by the\nimplications of the proposed dividend imputation legislation,\nit said.\n    As previously reported, dividends will become tax-free in\nshareholders' hands provided they are paid out of profits that\nhave borne the full 49 pct company tax rate.\n    BHP, which confined comment to the third quarter, said\npetroleum net earnings dropped to 98.8 mln dlrs from 139.6 mln\na year earlier, and steel profit to 27.0 mln from 48.8 mln.\n    BHP said the petroleum division earnings fall reflected\ngenerally lower oil prices and sales volumes from Bass Strait\nwhile the steel decline was due to a five pct fall in domestic\nsales and higher costs associated with the commissioning of new\nplant and some operational difficulties.\n    The rise in third quarter minerals net to 95.7 mln dlrs\nfrom 81.5 mln a year earlier largely reflected the increase in\nownership of the Mt Newman iron ore project, it said.\n    The 60.7 mln dlr extraordinary gain, all in the third term,\nreflected a 240.7 mln profit on the sale of <Blue Circle\nSouthern Cement Ltd> offset by a U.S. Oil acreage writedown.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
