        "BODY": "The Fried. Krupp GmbH\n<KRPG.D> steel and engineering group said it had a satisfactory\n1986 despite a provisional 12 pct fall in total group sales to\n18.1 billion marks from 20.7 billion the previous year.\n    Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5\nbillion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from\n16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement.\n    Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar's\nweakness against the mark and oil and raw materials price\nfalls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year.\n    The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery and\nplant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales.\n    Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineering\nbusiness achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions had\nunderpinned machinery and component activities.\n    An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, the\ntrading and services sectors, affected the group's total order\nfigures.\n    However, \"all business sectors contributed to the positive\nresults achieved in 1986,\" Krupp added, without giving details.\n    Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marks\nfrom the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9\nbillion, it said. Foreign business accounted for 38 pct of\norders against 40 pct in 1985.\n    Orders received by the machinery and plant sector, 11\nmember companies which comprise the core area of the group,\nrose by four mln marks last year to 6.9 billion, Krupp said.\n    The group's orders in hand amounted to 9.1 billion marks at\nend-December 1986 from 10.3 billion at the start of the year.\n    Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased by\nthree pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said.\n    The steel market weakened increasingly over the year,\nmainly because of exchange rate movements, the deterioration in\nforeign trade and a downturn in a number of customer\nindustries.\n    The difficult market for sections and flats of quality\nsteel depressed order tonnages by around seven pct, Krupp said.\nBut special steel boosted by strong demand for stainless\ncold-rolled flats, grew by five pct in tonnage terms.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
