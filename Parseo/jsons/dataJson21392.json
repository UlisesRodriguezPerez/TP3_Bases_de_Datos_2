        "BODY": "Turkey's current account deficit widened\nin July to 674 mln dlrs from 454 mln in June but fell from 1.22\nbillion in July last year, the State Statistics Institute said.\n    The cumulative trade position in July showed a 1.85 billion\ndlr deficit after 1.33 billion in June and 1.89 billion a year\nearlier, with exports at 4.91 billion and imports, both FOB, at\n6.76 billion.\n    The government aims to narrow the current account deficit\nfor the whole of 1987 to 975 mln dlrs, compared with 1.52\nbillion last year, up from 1.01 billion in 1985.\n    Bankers forecast the 1987 deficit will exceed one billion\ndlrs,  because a spurt in exports is expected to slow\nconsiderably in the last five months following a massive\ndrawdown of inventories.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
