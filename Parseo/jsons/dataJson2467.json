        "BODY": "The sharp fall in international coffee\nprices will not affect Colombia's external credit situation,\nfinance minister Cesar Gaviria told reuters.\n    He said the current depression on world coffee markets was\nnot totally unexpected and would have no immediate bearing on\nColombia's financial state which he described as sound.\n    \"Our foreign debt is high, but we can pay and I hope the\nforeign banking community will maintain its position toward us,\"\nhe said.\n    Colombia, the only major latin american country not to have\nrescheduled its external public debt, has a total foreign debt\nof 13.6 billion dlrs.\n    Calls for a rescheduling of the debt have come this week\nfrom the opposition conservative party and the biggest trade\nunion following the coffee price drop. Gaviria said lower\ncoffee prices this year could mean a loss of 1.5 billion dlrs\nin revenues for 1987.\n    Gaviria submitted to the world bank and the inter-american\nbank last week in new york a borrowing plan, for a total of\n3.054 billion dlrs to be disbursed over the next four years,\nwhich he said was approved.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
