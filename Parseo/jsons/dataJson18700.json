        "BODY": "Dutch consumers and food processors\nwould be hit hard by the proposed EC tax on oils and fats, Dick\nde Bruyn, chairman of the commodity board for margarine, fats\nand oils, MVO, said at the annual meeting.\n    The Dutch are the second largest consumers of margarine and\nfourth largest consumers of vegetable oils in the EC.\n    The fiercely contested tax would be a levy on consumers and\nsteeply increase the costs of industries such as potato\nprocessing and cake and biscuit manufacturing, de Bruyn said.\n    \"A move by these industries to countries outside the EC\ncannot be ruled out,\" he added.\n    De Bruyn said the tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats\nwould be wide open to fraud, difficult to police, and hugely\nexpensive administratively.\n    He also said the proposed tax contravened not only article\nthree of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the\nLome Convention, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture\nOrganization (FAO) guidelines, but also the EC's own Treaty.\n    The proposed tax would not only be inflationary but also\nhave consequences for employment and investment, he added.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
