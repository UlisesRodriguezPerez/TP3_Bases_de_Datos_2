        "BODY": "Venezuela has obtained more than 300 mln\ndlrs in financing for industrial projects and increased its\nlines of credit for import financing, finance minister Manuel\nAzpurua said.\n    'We can say that we are achieving the recuperation of\ncredit, but that cannot be done overnight,' Azpurua said in a\ntelevision interview.\n    He said a credit agreement for 100 mln marks will be signed\nthis week with the German state bank Kreditanstalt fur\nWiederaufbau (KFW), to finance an expansion of the state\naluminum company Venalum.\n    The credit will be divided into two separate agreements,\none for 85 mln marks with an interest rate of 6.13 pct, and\nanother for 15 mln marks, at 6.20 pct.\n    Azpurua said financing has also been obtained for expansion\nof Alcasa, another state aluminum company, and for projects in\nthe state steel and petrochemical industries.\n    Yesterday, he said Venezuela obtained two new credits of\n5.0 mln dlrs each for export financing, one from Credit du Nord\nof France and the other from Britain's Midland Bank.\n    The Venezuelan government has been criticised at home for\nfailing to obtain new credits, despite its insistence on\nrepaying foreign debt according to the terms of a rescheduling\naccord reached last February.\n    Azpurua recently visited Tokyo hoping to acquire new\ncredits for industrial expansions but clinched no agreements.\nJapanese officials refused to allow a new issue of Venezuelan\nbonds until the country regains its 'Triple A' credit rating.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
