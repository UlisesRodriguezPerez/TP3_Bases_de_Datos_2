        "BODY": "External risks for the economy have\nincreased, but growth of two to 2.5 pct this year is still\npossible, according to President of the West German Federation\nof Banks, Hanns Christian Schroeder-Hohenwarth.\n    Schroeder-Hohenwarth told a news conference the further\nfall of the dollar since the start of this year and the\nrevaluation of the mark against European currencies meant West\nGerman exporters were facing a \"rough wind.\"\n    However, domestic demand was continuing to rise and private\nconsumption in particular would support the economy, he said.\nHe saw good prospects for consumer industries.\n    Schroeder-Hohenwarth said economic policy now had to\nconcentrate on strengthening this domestic growth. In this\ncontext, he welcomed a decision by the government to increase\nthe scope of tax cuts due in 1988.\n    He added, a planned reform of the fiscal system scheduled\nfor 1990, which was worked out by coalition partners this\nmonth, was an \"important step in the right direction.\"\n    The government plans to cut corporation tax to 50 pct from\n56 pct. However, Schroeder-Hohenwarth said the decision to cut\nthe maximum rate of income tax to only 53 pct from 56 pct was\n\"rather half-hearted.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003"
