        "BODY": "Officials from Indonesia, Malaysia,\nSingapore and, perhaps, Thailand will meet here tomorrow to\ndiscuss increased regional cooperation on rubber marketing and\nways to raise rubber prices, industry sources said.\n    The officials will discuss linking rubber markets in the\nfour countries to improve price transparency, the sources said.\n    This is the first time Indonesia is attending such a\nmeeting, they said, but representatives from Thailand may not\nbe able to attend because of their tight schedule. Malaysia,\nIndonesia and Thailand account for 90 pct of world rubber\nexports and Singapore is a major regional rubber trading\ncentre.\n    The Malaysian Rubber Futures market, freighting and\ncontracts for rubber are among other issues expected to be\ndiscussed.\n    Last month, rubber importing and exporting countries\nadopted a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva.\nThe new pact is more responsive to market trends than its\npredecessor, the sources said, and earlier provisions allowing\nthe buffer stock to borrow from banks have been eliminated.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
