        "BODY": "The Federal Reserve is expected to\nenter the U.S. government securities market to add temporary\nreserves, economists said.\n    They said it is likely to supply the reserves indirectly by\narranging two to 2.5 billion dlrs of customer repurchase\nagreements. There is less chance of a direct reserve add\ninstead via System repurchase agreements.\n    Federal funds, which averaged 6.21 pct yesterday, opened at\n6-3/8 pct and traded between there and 6-7/16 pct.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
