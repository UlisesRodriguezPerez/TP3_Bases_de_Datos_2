        "BODY": "The Nigerian naira firmed  against the\ndollar, banking sources said, after the rules governing foreign\nexchange auctions at the central bank were changed.\n    The marginal rate set at today's auction, from which\nreporters were barred for the first time since the sessions\nbegan last September, was 3.7001 to the dollar compared with\n4.0002 at the last session on March 19, the sources said.\n    Under the new system unveiled on March 20 and in operation\nfor the first time today, bidding banks must pay for foreign\nexchange at the rate they bid, rather than as previously at the\nrate of the lowest successful bid.\n    The measure was aimed at discouraging banks from bidding\nhigh and thus driving down the naira's value. But banking\nsources and other analysts said demand for foreign exchange\nremained sharply higher than the available funds.\n    Henceforth the sessions will be held every fortnight,\ninstead of weekly, and today only 80 mln dlrs was on offer\ncompared with the 50 mln dlrs usually on sale each week.\n    The rule change appeared to have an immediate impact on\nbids. Today's highest bid was 4.06 to the dollar, compared with\na top bid of 4.25 two weeks ago.\n    Banks who bid higher than the marginal rate will be able to\npass on their rate to their customers, while the marginal rate\nwill only act as a marker for transactions.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
