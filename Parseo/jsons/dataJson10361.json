        "DATELINE": "    WELLINGTON, March 27 - ",
        "BODY": "<Brierley Investments Ltd> (BIL)\nlaunched a full takeover bid for the supermarket group\n<Progressive Enterprises Ltd> at 4.35 dlrs a share.\n    BIL said in a statement the offer is conditional on minimum\nacceptances totalling 30 mln shares, just under 25 pct of the\n120.4 mln Progressive shares on issue.\n    Progressive is currently involved in a proposed merger with\n<Rainbow Corp Ltd>. Rainbow earlier this week raised its stake\nin Progressive to 52 pct. BIL opposes the Rainbow merger and\nanalysts say BIL needs a 25 pct stake in Progressive to prevent\nit occurring.\n    The merger involves shareholders in Progressive and Rainbow\nboth receiving shares in a new company <Astral Pacific Corp\nLtd> on a one-for-one exchange basis.\n    The BIL bid is higher than the 4.20 dlrs BIL said it would\noffer when it first announced on Monday it would make a full\nbid for Progressive, and it follows much public debate between\nBIL and Rainbow.\n    BIL Chief Executive Paul Collins said last week that he\nopposes the Rainbow/Progressive merger because BIL sees\nProgressive shares as being worth twice as much as Rainbow's.\nBIL has not disclosed how many Progressive shares it holds.\n    Rainbow has said the merger is soundly based. Chairman\nAllan Hawkins said last week that BIL's actions were aimed only\nat dirsrupting the merger and were not in the interests of\nProgressive shareholders.\n    Both Rainbow's and Progressive's boards have approved the\nmerger proposal. It has also been approved by the Commerce\nCommission, but BIL's bid is still subject to the Commission's\nscrutiny.\n    Progressive shares ended at 4.35 dlrs, Rainbow at 3.42 and\nBIL at 4.17 at the close of New Zealand Stock Exchange trading\ntoday.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
