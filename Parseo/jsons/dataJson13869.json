        "BODY": "Shifts in domestic economic policy,\nnot a further fall in the dollar or trade restrictions, are the\nkey to reducing imbalances in trade and payments, Dutch Finance\nMiniister H. Onno Ruding said.\n    Ruding told a meeting of the World Trade Forum here that\nprotectionism would naturally lead to retaliation and aggravate\nthe problems of heavily indebted developing countries.\n    \"The main contribution towards resolving the still enourmous\nU.S. trade deficit is not repeat not a further fall in the\ndollar, is not still more protectionism in your country.\"\n    \"No, it is - like in other countries - changes in domestic\neconomic and financial policies,\" Ruding said.\n    Ruding said he was less worried about a crisis of the\nweakening dollar than he was in January before the Paris accord\nto stabilize foreign exchange rates.\n    He said the highest priority should be given to policy\nchanges in the United States, especially reducing the budget\ndeficit and encouraging domestic savings.\n    But he said other countries, such as Japan and West\nGermany, also needed to take greater steps toward reducing\ntheir trade surpluses.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
