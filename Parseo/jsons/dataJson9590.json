        "TITLE": "SOUTHWESTERN BELL <SBC> SEES EARNINGS DILUTION",
        "DATELINE": "    ST. LOUIS, Mo., March 25 - ",
        "BODY": "Southwestern Bell Corp said that\nits planned acquisitions of cellular telephone and paging\nsystems, including those of <Metromedia Inc>, will result in\nsome initial earnings dilution and an increase in debt ratio.\n    In a letter to shareholders in its 1986 annual report, the\nregional Bell company did not indicate the degree of earnings\ndilution it expects from the acquisitions, which total some\n1.38 billion dlrs. However, the company said the rise in its\ndebt ratio will be temporary and will leave its debt level\nwithin an acceptable range.\n    In its 1986 yearend financial statement, Southwestern Bell\nlisted a debt-to-equity ratio of 43.4 pct, down slightly from\n43.7 pct in 1985.\n    In 1986, the company earned 1.02 billion dlrs, or 10.26\ndlrs a share, compared with 996.2 mln dlrs, or 10 dlrs a share\nin 1985. Revenues dipped to 7.90 billion dlrs from 7.93 billion\ndlrs.\n    Southwestern Bell said it expects the new tax law to have a\nnegative impact on its cash flow, due mainly to the loss of\ninvestment tax credits.\n    By mid-year, however, the company said a reduced corporate\ntax rate should have a positive impact on its net income and\ncash flow.\n    In addition, the company said it is projecting a 1.7 pct\ngain in customer telephone lines and a three to four pct\nincrease in long distance calling volumes.\n    Southwestern Bell said 1987 capital expenditures will be\nlower that the 1.97 billion dlrs spent in 1986, a year in which\nexpenditures were held below budget.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
