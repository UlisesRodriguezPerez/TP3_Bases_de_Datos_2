        "TITLE": "BANK OF JAPAN DETERMINED TO KEEP EASY MONEY POLICY",
        "DATELINE": "    TOKYO, June 29 - ",
        "BODY": "The Bank of Japan bought 100 billion yen\nin certificates of deposit (CDs) via repurchase agreements\ntoday to show its determination to maintain an easy money\npolicy, central bank officials said.\n    \"Today's CD buying operation was designed to seek an\nannouncement effect, in which we would reassure the market of\nthe fact that we have not changed our policy stance,\" a senior\ncentral bank official told Reuters.\n    The bank also bought 400 billion yen in two-month\ncommercial bills to smooth out tight credit conditions in the\ninterbank market today, the officials said.\n    The central bank was concerned about growing market\nexpectations of higher interest rates, which were in part\nresponsible for the recent plunge in stock and yen bond prices,\nthe officials said.\n    But money traders said the market generally shrugged off\nthe bank's CD operation because it was small and at a rate far\nbelow prevailing market rates. The rate on the key three-month\nCDs in the primary market was 4.08/00 pct, while the bank's bid\nwas 3.75 pct, they said.\n    The bank's bill buying operation also had little impact\nbecause it was regarded as a routine operation, they said.\n    The money traders said they regarded the central bank's CD\nbuying operation as simply a gesture to live up to Japan's\npledge to guide interest rates lower and stimulate the economy.\n    \"We did not expect the central bank to ease its credit grip\nany further,\" a bank manager said, adding that the prevailing\nmarket expectation of higher rates will remain.\n    \"If this is the case, the three-month CD rate will stay\nabove four pct for the time being,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
