        "TITLE": "BRAZILIAN BANK WORKERS DECIDE ON NATIONAL STRIKE",
        "DATELINE": "    CAMPINAS, Brazil, March 15 - ",
        "BODY": "Brazilian bank workers voted\nto launch a nationwide strike this month, compounding labour\nunrest arising from the failure of the government's\nanti-inflation plan.\n    At a rally in this city, about 100 km northwest of Sao\nPaulo, about 5,000 bank workers voted to strike on March 24\nunless their demand for 100 pct pay rises is met.\n    Wilson Gomes de Moura, president of the national\nconfederation which groups the bank employees' 152 unions\nrepresenting 700,000 workers, told Reuters the indefinite\nstoppage would affect all banks.\n    The vote came as a stoppage by seamen entered its third\nweek and as 55,000 oil workers threatened action against the\nstate-owned petroleum company Petrobras.\n    The government ordered thousands of troops into the\nrefineries on Tuesday to forestall any occupation, but the\ntroops were removed yesterday.\n    Petrobras said it had requested their withdrawal because\nthe refineries were calm and oil workers had indicated their\nwillingess to negotiate next Wednesday. The government has also\nsent marines into the main ports.\n    A spokesman at strike headquarters for the seamen in Rio de\nJaneiro said unions were studying an offer by private\nshipowners for a 120 pct pay rise.\n    Seamen employed by two small companies have already\naccepted a 120 pct pay rise and returned to work, as have about\n5,000 seamen employed by Petrobras.\n    Last week also saw widespread protests by hundreds of\nthousands of farmers over what they see as unfairly high\ninterest rates charged by banks.\n    According to official estimates, prices rose by more than\n33 pct in the first two months of this year.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
