        "BODY": "The Bank of Japan intervened to stem\nstrong yen rises against the dollar during London trading this\nmorning, dealers said.\n    The Bank of Japan here declined comment.\n    The Bank of England was also rumored to be buying dollars\nagainst the yen this morning but it also declined comment.\n    Dealers said the intervention halted a sudden late morning\ndrop to a low of 148.65 yen, holding the dollar steady until\nmidsession at about 148.80.\n    The Bank of England was strongly rumored to have intervened\non behalf of the dollar against the yen yesterday, but it gave\nno confirmation.\n    Overnight reports from Tokyo said that the Bank of Japan\nwas aggressively supporting the dollar, but failed to push it\nback to the perceived target level of 150 yen.\n    Selling during the London trading morning was largely\nattributed to Japanese institutions.\n    Dealers here were loath to quantify the scale of Bank of\nJapan action this morning. One U.S. Bank trader said it could\nhave been up to 500 mln dlrs, but said this was largely a\nguess.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
