        "BODY": "Visible stocks of 17 oils and fats are\nprobably peaking now and are likely to fall sharply by October\n1 this year, the Oil World newsletter said.\n    Oil World forecast that stocks of oils and fats may be cut\nto only 9.8 mln tonnes at the end of this season, compared with\n10.6 mln a year earlier.\n    Its survey covered  13 oils -- soy, cotton, groundnut, sun,\nrape, sesame, corn, olive, coconut, palmkernel, palm, lin and\ncastor  -- and four animal oils and fats -- butter, fish oil,\nlard and tallow/greases.\n    Oil World's analysis predicted only a slight production\nincrease of 0.5 mln tonnes in the year to end-September 1987,\ncompared with increases of 3.6 mln and 4.0 mln tonnes in the\nprevious two seasons.\n    It said world consumption was continuing to rise. Unusually\nlow prices prevailing since early 1986 had stimulated demand\nfor both food and non-food purposes, it said.\n    World consumption  could increase by a record 2.8 mln\ntonnes to 71.8 mln tonnes this season and would be even higher\nif the Indian government did not artificially curb domestic\ndemand.\n    Oil World said it did not expect the European Community\n(EC) to introduce a vegetable oils tax, but if such a tax were\nintroduced it would have a negative impact on EC consumption.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
