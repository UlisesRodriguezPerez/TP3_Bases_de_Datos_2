        "BODY": "Maize deliveries to Zimbabwe's\nstate-owned Grain Marketing Board (GMB) will fall by over 65\npct this year, following a prolonged dry spell, agricultural\nindustry sources said.\n    They said 1987 maize deliveries are expected to decline to\naround 520,000 tonnes from 1.6 mln tonnes last year. About 60\npct of the maize will be delivered by large-scale commercial\nfarmers and the balance by small-scale peasant producers.\n    Although this will be the lowest level of maize deliveries\nsince 1980, the sources said there is no danger of a food\nshortage in Zimbabwe.\n    While annual maize consumption is estimated at 750,000\ntonnes, the GMB stockpile is currently around 1.8 mln tonnes,\nwhich means that even with the sharply reduced production this\nyear Zimbabwe has enough maize for the next three years.\n    The sources said the lower maize crop would be offset by a\n25 pct increase in cotton production to 315,000 tonnes from\n248,000 tonnes last year, and by a rise of 20 pct in soybean\ndeliveries to 100,000 tonnes from 84,000 tonnes in 1986.\n  REUTER\n\u0003"
