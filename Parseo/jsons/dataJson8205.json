        "BODY": "USAir Group Inc said it has amended\nits 69 dlr per share tender offer for shares of Piedmont\nAviation Inc to reduce the maximum number it will accept to\n9,309,394. Previously it had sought all shares.\n    In a newspaper advertisement, USAir said the offer and\nwithdrawal rights have not been extended and will still expire\nApril 3, along with the new proration period.\n    On Friday, the U.S. Department of Transportation approved\nUSAir's acquisition of 51 pct of Piedmont. If USAir were to\nacquire more than 51 pct in the tender, it would be required to\nsell the excess within one week.\n    USAir said receipt of the 9,309,394 shares -- which is also\nthe minimum amount it will accept -- would give it a total of\nabout 61 pct of Piedmont shares currently outstanding and 50.1\npct on a fully diluted basis.\n    The company said even if the purchase of the 9,309,394\nPiedmont shares caused it to exceed the 51 pct limit, USAir\nwould waive the condition to the offer that the Transportation\nDepartment approve a voting trust agreement permitting USAir to\nbuy and hold shares under the offer pending review of USAir's\napplication to gain control of Piedmont, subject to the order\nnot being rescinded or modified in an adverse way.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
