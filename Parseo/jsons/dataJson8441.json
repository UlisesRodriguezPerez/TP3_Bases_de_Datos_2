        "BODY": "Takeover speculation buoyed Wendy's\nInternational Inc's stock, even after Coca Cola Co took the\nfizz out of market rumors by denying it was an interested\nsuitor.\n    Wendy's retreated from an earlier high of 13-3/8, and lost\na point when Coca Cola <KO> said the rumors were untrue.\nHowever, Wendy's remained up 5/8 at 12-3/8 on volume of more\nthan three mln shares.\n    Several analysts were skeptical of the rumors, yet they\nsaid they could not conclude a takeover of the fast food\nrestaurant chain was impossible.\n    Wendy's declined comment on takeover rumors of all kinds.\nYet, a Wendy's spokesman said the company was aware of a\nBusiness Week article, which named Coke as a potential suitor\nand which market sources said helped ignite the rumor mill.\n    Market sources mentioned Anheuser-Busch Inc <BUD> and\nPepsico Inc <PEP> as alternatives to Coke as acquirers. Neither\nof those companies would comment, nor would the Wendy's\nofficial.\n    \"It doesn't happen every day, every week, every month, but\nits not unusual for us to be linked with those companies,\" said\nDenny Lynch, Wendy's vice president of communications.\n    However, Lynch would not comment specifically on the\ncurrent market rumors.\n    Even before Coke denied the rumors, analysts had been\nskeptical of a takeover since Atlanta-based Coke has stated it\nviews fast food chains as customers and does not want to become\na competitor to them.\n    \"I can't put another name on it,\" said Kidder peabody\nanalyst Jay Freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold up\nWendy's stock. \"It very well could be someone's interested.\"\n    But Freedman said he doesn't believe now is the right time\nfor Wendy's to be sold.\n    \"They're obviously having operational difficulties. I've\nalways believed at the right price Wendy's would consider (an\noffer), but I can't believe this is the right price at the\nright time,\" Freedman said.\n    \"If a transaction takes place, the buyer's going to control\nthe situation,\" Freedman said.\n    \"I just don't think there's anything going on. I don't\nthink it's worth much more than where it is,\" said Joseph Doyle\nof Smith Barney.\n    Analysts said Wendy's has suffered largely from the \"burger\nwars\" between itself, McDonald's Corp <MCD> and Pillsbury Co's\n<PSY> Burger King chain. Wendy's, the third largest fast food\nhamburger chain in the U.S., lost about 11 pct in same store\nsales last year, analysts said.\n    Wendy's also fumbled when it introduced a high-priced\nbreakfast, which it has since withdrawn, analysts said. Some\nanalysts said the company should be bringing in new products,\nbut it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround.\n    There are analysts, however, who believe Wendy's may be\nvulnerable to a takeover.\n    James Murren of C.J. Lawrence said Wendy's could be worth\n14 to 15 dlrs on a break-up basis. He said the company has\nimproved its debt-to-equity ratio and Wendy's owns a high\npercent of its own restaurants - 38 pct of 3,500.\n    \"They also have some attractive leaseholds on their\nrestaurants,\" Murren said.\n    Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year,\nWendy's real sales, store for store, turned upwards in the\nfourth quarter. \"That was about the first time in seven\nquarters,\" he said.\n    Caroline Levy of E.F. Hutton also believes something could\nbe going on with Wendy's. \"My gut feeling is something's going\nto happen. I don't know what,\" she said.\n    She estimated a takeover price would be at least 15 dlrs\nper share.\n    One analyst speculated that Coke became the rumored suitor\nbecause Wendy's decided to sell Coke at its fountains instead\nof Pepsi.\n    Wendy's is currently embroiled in litigation brought by\nPepsi, which holds a contract with the company, analysts said.\nPepsi's soda is still sold in the Wendy's restaurants.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
