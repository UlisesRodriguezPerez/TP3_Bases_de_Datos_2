        "BODY": "France's growth rate is expected to\nstrengthen in the second half of this year after a poor first\nhalf, but unemployment will worsen, the Organisation for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.\n    In its semi-annual review of the world economy, the OECD\nforecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\nwould run at about two pct in the next six months. It said the\nrate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantly\nhigher than in the first half of this year.\n    The OECD said France's economic situation has deteriorated\nsomewhat during the early months of 1987. \n    Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventory\nadjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation\nhas reaccelerated, the OECD said. Unemployment is likely to\nreach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.\n    The report said inflation should slow and domestic demand\npick up in the second half of this year. But both data are\nlikely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.\n    The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices for\nthe second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first six\nmonths. The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pct\nfor the whole year, sharply up from last year's 2.2 pct.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
