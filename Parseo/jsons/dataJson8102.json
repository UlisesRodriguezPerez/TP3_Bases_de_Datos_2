        "BODY": "Long term pressure by trade\nministers is necessary if the current Uruguay round of talks on\nthe General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) is to\nsucceed, New Zealand's Overseas Trade minister Mike Moore said.\n    Moore told the opening meeting of trade ministers from 22\nnations gathered for informal talks on the GATT that ministers\n\"need opportunities to keep in touch and to consider how the\npolitical problems inherent in an exercise like this one can be\nfaced and resolved.\"\n    Moore said the Taupo meeting is one of a series of such\ninternational gatherings, which includes the OECD ministerial\nmeeting in May and the G-7 meeting in Venice in June, enabling\nministers to maintain contact.\n    World trade conditions are getting better not worse, he\nsaid.\n    He said New Zealand is \"moving rapidly and of our own\ninitiative in the direction of liberalisation, and I warn you\nwe shall be looking for partners.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003"
