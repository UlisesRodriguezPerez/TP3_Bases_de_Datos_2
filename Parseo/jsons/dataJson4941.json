        "BODY": "The U.S. Has dropped its insistence that\nthe floor price in a new International Natural Rubber\nAgreement, INRA, be revised downward under certain\ncircumstances, conference sources said.\n    The surprise conciliatory move by the U.S. Meets one of the\nproducers' main concerns -- that the floor price, or \"lower\nindicative price,\" remain unchanged, they said.\n    It is not clear, however, whether all consuming countries\nwill follow suit, as a number of them, in particular Britain,\nWest Germany and Belgium, appeared to have strong reservations,\nthe sources added.\n    The group of consumers has been seeking an adjustment of\nthe \"lower indicative price\" (set at 150 Malaysian/Singapore\ncents a kilo in the present pact) if the buffer stock,\ncurrently 360,000 tonnes, rises to 450,000 tonnes.\n    The sources said the question of to what extent price\nadjustments should be automatic remains a problem.\n    Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand has been\nholding consultations with producers and consumers throughout\nthe day.\n    The consumers' group is now holding a separate meeting\nahead of further consultations within the \"president's group\"\ntonight.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
