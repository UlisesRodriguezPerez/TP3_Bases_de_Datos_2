        "BODY": "The Australia based <Ariadne\nAustralia Ltd>, plans to set up a branch in the Philippines to\nfulfill a prerequisite for the takeover of the Philippine\nbrewing firm, <San Miguel Corp>, a Hong Kong newspaper said.\n    The Hong Kong Economic Journal quoted a spokesman of\nAustralian stock broker Jacksons Ltd as saying that <Barwon\nFarmlands Ltd>, a listed Australian firm of which Ariadne owns\na 30 pct stake, is planning a branch in the Philippines.\n    He added Jacksons is arranging an offer by Barwon to pay a\ntotal 3.8 billion pesos in cash for 38 mln San Miguel shares.\n    Barwon is offering 100 pesos each for 24 mln class A San\nMiguel shares and 14 mln class B stock. But the Jacksons\nspokesman noted that the more valuable A stock would only be\nsold to Filipinos or companies registered in the Philippines.\n    He said Barwon has approached the Philippine government\nwhich seized the block of shares from the United Coconut\nPlanters Bank, which is believed to be linked with the\ncountry's deposed President Ferdinand Marcos.\n    He added he expects a deal to be concluded between Barwon\nand the Philippine Government in 14 days as it is the only\noffer in cash, the newspaper reported.\n    Hong Kong Economic Journal also noted stock market rumours\nthat <Neptunia Corp>, a Hong Kong registered company which\ncontrolled by San Miguel's president Andres Soriano, is the\nother party keen on the block of San Miguel shares.\n    The Philippine's Commission on Good Government ruled last\nMay against a move of Neptunia to acquire 33 mln San Miguel\nshares controlled by the brewery firm's former chairman Eduardo\nCojuangco, who is also chairman of United Coconut.\n    Commissioner Ramon Diaz said at the time the government\nwould not allow a subsidiary to buy into a parent firm, adding\nSan Miguel could have offered the shares to other parties.\n    The Manila newspaper Sunday Times published a letter sent\nyesterday to President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne's chairman,\nNew Zealander Bruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalent\nto five pct of the nation's yearly budget to buy the shares\nfrom the government.\n    \"Judge's offer of 3.8 billion pesos is about five pct of the\nPhilippines' yearly budget,\" Ariadne's Philippine agent Domingo\nPanganiban was quoted as telling reporters yesterday.\n    Spokesmen of Ariadne, Jacksons and Neptunia were not\navailable for comment, nor any officials of the Philippines.\n    <San Miguel Brewery Ltd>, a Hong Kong listed company which\nis 69.65 pct held by Neptunia on behalf of San Miguel Corp,\nclosed 40 cents higher at 15.50 H.K. Dlrs on Friday.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
