        "BODY": "The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)\nis reviewing whether Trans World Airlines Inc <TWA> and\nChairman Carl Icahn violated federal antitrust law by failing\nto seek advance clearance from the DOJ or the Federal Trade\nCommission for his extensive open-market purchases of USAir\nGroup Inc <U> stock, a DOJ official told a Senate panel.\n    \"This is a matter that is being looked into,\" Charles Rule,\nacting assistant attorney general-antitrust, told the Senate\nJudiciary Committee's Antitrust Subcommittee.\n    Rule declined further comment while the review was\ncontinuing.\n    Rule was responding to panel Chairman Howard Metzenbaum\n(D-Ohio), who had asked why the department was not acting\nagainst \"what appears to be a clear violation of the law.\"\n    Metzenbaum said Icahn had failed to file a pre-merger\nnotification form with the FTC prior to purchasing more than 15\nmln dlrs' worth of USAir stock.\n    But Rule said that, for airline companies, a purchaser\nwould be exempt from the requirement if it instead had filed a\nmerger application with the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n    Icahn filed such an application with the DOT, but the\nfiling was thrown out by the DOT on Friday.\n    The DOT threw out the application late Friday on grounds it\nlacked the necessary data for the government to review the\nproposed USAir takeover bid.\n    Icahn refiled a more complete application form Monday.\n    Rule pledged to act against Icahn and TWA if a violation\nwere found.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
