        "BODY": "Rising demand for U.S. rice may\ngradually reduce surpluses while a marketing loan should help\nincrease the U.S. share of the world rice market despite\nsluggish trade this year, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.\n    In its quarterly rice outlook and situation summary, the\ndepartment said U.S. rice use may surpass production during the\n1986/87 marketing year, causing stocks to fall about 10 mln\nhundredweight from a year earlier to an estimated 67 mln cwt on\nJuly 31.\n    Long grain acreage as a percentage of total acreage is\nexpected to decline this year, the report said.\n    USDA said factors once supportive of increased long grain\nacreage have turned around. Domestic prices of medium grain\nrelative to long grain have increased, the loan differential\nhas been greatly reduced and increases in long grain yields\nrelative to those of other classes have leveled off.\n    With the drop in domestic prices resulting from the\nmarketing loan, domestic rice use is expected to grow at a\nfaster rate, USDA said.\n    \"Development of new products and increased promotion have\nhelped make rice more available and visible to a wider range of\nconsumers,\" USDA said.\n    USDA said world trade is expected to fall in 1987 because\nof large production and stocks but a weaker market should\naffect competing exporters more than the U.S.\n    \"The United States has already recovered a substantial share\nof the European Community market and made inroads into markets\nin the Middle East and Africa,\" the report said.\n    World rice consumption is projected to reach record levels\nin 1986/87, the report said, as higher per capita incomes,\nincreased domestic production and low import prices have\nallowed people in many countries to substitute rice for coarse\ngrains.\n    China, India and South Korea have increased output, while\nthe Middle East and Africa have doubled imports since the\nmid-1970s, the report said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
