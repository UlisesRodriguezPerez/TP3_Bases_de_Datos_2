        "BODY": "Venezuela will lend Ecuador 50,000\nbarrels per day of crude oil over the next few months to help\nit meet its export commitments, Energy and Mines Minister\nArturo Hernandez Grisanti said today.\n    He said that under the terms of this loan, agreed during a\nvisit here this week by Ecuador's Deputy Energy Minister\nFernando Santos Alvite, Ecuador will begin repaying the loan in\nAugust.\n    Hernandez Grisanti said the loan will go part way to\noffsetting the loss of Ecuador's 140,000 in exports caused by\nearthquake damage to 25 miles of pipeline last week.\n    Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline\nconnecting its jungle oil fields with the pacific port of Balao\nwas put out of action.\n    Venezuela has an output quota of 1.495 bpd, while Ecuador's\nis 210,000 bpd. Santos Alvite said Ecuador will ask OPEC to\nallow it to produce 100,000 bpd above its quota when the\npipeline is repaired to offset present production losses.\n    Hernandez Grisanti said also a first 300,000 barrels\nshipment of Venezuelan crude oil will leave for Ecuador this\nweekend to help meet domestic consumption needs.\n    The oil, part of a five mln additional crude oil loan by\nVenezuela, will be processed at Guayaquil refineries.\n    \"If we had not supplied oil to Ecuador the life of this\ncountry would have ground to a halt,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
