        "BODY": "Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul\nVolcker said that debtor nations have made much progress in\nlaying the groundwork for economic growth, but a solution to\nworld debt difficulties was endangered by inaction on new\nfinancing.\n    \"There is clearly a danger that adequate financing\narrangements are not being negotiated and put in place in a\ntimely way,\" Volcker told the Senate Banking Committee.\n    The borrowing countries need to be able to proceed with\nconfidence that the necessary funds will be available to them,\nhe said.\n    Brazil has the potential for becoming a leading world\neconomic power, but it is in a difficult position today,\nVolcker said.\n    He said it will take a concerted effort to regularize\nBrazil's external payments.\n    \"The key prerequisite is clearly in the hands of Brazilian\nauthorities,\" he said.\n    Both Brazil and its creditors have a strong incentive to\nwork together, Volcker said.\n    Regarding trade imbalances, Volcker said that it was\ncritically important that markets be kept open by the\nindustrial nations.\n    In addition, the United States must reduce its budget\ndeficit and foreign nations need to provide stimulus to their\ndomestic economies, Volcker said.\n    \"We need time for those actions and the earlier\ndepreciation to work their effects,\" he said.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003"
