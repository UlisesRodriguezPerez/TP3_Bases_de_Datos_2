        "DATELINE": "    AKRON, Ohio, April 13 - ",
        "BODY": "Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co said it\nexpects to sell its Celeron Corp oil and gas subsidiary for\nabout two billion dlrs in about two months.\n    After the company's annual meeting, Rober Mercer,\nGoodyear's chairman and chief executive officer, also said \nGoodyear expects to report a profit of more than one dlr a\nshare from continuing operations in the first quarter. In the\nsame year-ago period, Goodyear reported a loss of 64 cents a\nshare from continuing operations.\n    Mercer said about seven companies are interested in buying\nCeleron and they may form a consortium to buy the unit.\n    Celeron consists of oil and gas reserves and an almost\ncomplete pipeline linking drilling operations in Santa Barbara,\nCalif., to Texas refineries. Mercer said Celeron's reserves\nwould not be sold separately from the pipeline.\n    Concerning speculation that two billion dlr price tag for\nCeleron was too high, Mercer said \"There is no fire sale going\non here and we can continue to keep Celeron as a profitable\noperation throughout the year.\"\n    Mercer said the expected 1st quarter operating profit was\nbased on the new share total after Goodyear's share repurchase\nlast year to fend off Sir James Goldsmith's hostile takeover\nbid.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
