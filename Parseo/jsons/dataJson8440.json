        "BODY": "Iraq said today its warplnes had\nattacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to\nkeep up such raids until the Gulf war ends.\n    The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations\nbroke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action.\n    It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad\nhailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranian\nyear which ended on Saturday.\n    A high command communique said warplanes hit the western\njetty at Iran's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and\nstruck a supertanker nearby at the same time.\n    The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August\n1985, was last raided in January.\n    The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said\ncolumns of smoke were seen billowing from it.\n    In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian\ntanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier\nGulf attack.\n    But there has been no independent confirmation of today's\nsupertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by\nBaghdad in the past 24 hours.\n    The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March eight,\nwhen the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg.\n    Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran's offshore oilfields at\nNowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50\nmiles) west of Kharg island, today's communique said.\n    The three oilfields have been raided several times in the\npast three years. Oil sources said they were not crucially\nimportant to Iran's oil export trade.\n    A second high command communique today said Iraqi warplanes\nflew 94 sorties against Iranan targets and positions at the war\nfront.\n    It also reported a clash between Iraqi naval units and\nseveral Iranian boats carrying men to attack an Iraqi oil\nterminal at the northen tip of the Gulf.\n    Two Iranian boats wer destroyed and sunk with their\noccupants and the others fled, it said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
