        "BODY": "Buoyed by low fuel prices and\nfavourable currency factors, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd's\n<CAPH.HK> 1986 profits are expected to surpass the airline's\nforecast of one billion H.K. Dlrs, stock analysts said.\n    Analysts said they expect the airline to show net earnings\nof between 1.1 billion and 1.25 billion dlrs when it reports\nresults tomorrow for its first year as a public company.\n    Cathay, 51 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HK>, made\nits earnings forecast in the prospectus for its flotation in\nMay last year.\n    Cathay is expected to pay a 13-cent final dividend, making\na total of 19 cents for the year, as forecast in the\nprospectus, analysts polled by Reuters said.\n    They said the airline's performance improved in the second\nhalf of the year after it reported interim profits of 503 mln\ndlrs.\n    The weakness of the local currency, pegged at 7.80 to one\nU.S. Dollar, and low fuel prices moved further in the company's\nfavour from the assumptions made in the prospectus at the time\nof the flotation, James Capel (Far East) Ltd said.\n    James Capel estimates average fuel prices for the airline\nindustry in 1986 at 63 U.S. Cents per gallon, 27 pct below the\n1985 level. It said a one pct movement in fuel prices would\naffect Cathay's net profits by 10 mln dlrs and forecast profits\nof 1.25 billion dlrs.\n     Analysts said the company's estimates of fuel price and\ncurrency movements set out in its prospectus were conservative.\n    \"This is reflected in their interim results which showed\nthat profit margin has increased,\" said Frederick Tsang of\nMansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd.\n    Cathay's six-month turnover rose 19.8 pct from year-earlier\nlevels, but profits rose 69 pct.\n    The rise in oil prices in late 1986 had little impact on\nthe company's fuel oil bill last year, as aviation fuel prices\nusually lag behind crude price movements by several months,\nanalysts said.\n    By last September the yen had risen some 54 pct against the\nHong Kong dollar from the end of 1985, the mark 43 pct and\nsterling 12 pct.\n    \"Overall the weakness of the Hong Kong dollar against\nCathay's major trading currencies helped push passenger yields\nin the first half up 7.2 pct,\" said James Capel. \"This should\ncontinue through the second half to enable passenger yields to\nend the year up 7.6 pct.\"\n    A strong performance from the 2.9 billion dlrs in cash\nunder management also improved profits, James Capel said.\n    A general improvement in air traffic last year contributed\nto Cathay's revenue increase, but the company's load factor\ndeclined because of increased competition and an expansion of\nits fleet and services.\n    James Capel estimated Cathay's passenger-kilometres flown\nlast year rose six pct from 1985 and freight-kilometres flown\nclimbed 17 pct, though the airline's load factor probably fell\nto 68.8 pct from 70 pct.\n    \"Cathay added new planes, and was forced to fly some routes\nlast year because of the threat of competition from Dragon Air,\"\nsaid Tsang. \"This affected its load factor.\"\n    Fear of possible competition from fledgling carrier <Hong\nKong Dragon Airways Ltd> may have contributed to Cathay's\ndecision to resume service to New Zealand last year, analysts\nsaid.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
