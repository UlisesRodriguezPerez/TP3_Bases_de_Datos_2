        "BODY": "International Cocoa Organization (ICCO)\ntalks on buffer stock rules have slowed during a crucial phase\nof negotiations, delegates said, but they remained confident\nabout prospects for reaching agreement by Friday.\n    Cocoa producers, European Community (EC) consumers and all\nconsumers separately reviewed technical details of a buffer\nstock rules package distributed yesterday.\n    The buffer stock working group of consumers and producers\nwas set to meet later today to debate the proposal jointly for\nthe first time, they said.\n    Delegates said major sticking points were likely to be the\namount of non-member cocoa allowed to be bought for the buffer\nstock, and the fixed price differentials at which different\norigin cocoas will be offered to the buffer stock manager.\n    Producers would prefer that non-member cocoa not be\nincluded in the buffer stock because, if it is, countries such\nas Malaysia benefit from the cocoa agreement without joining\nit, the delegates said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
