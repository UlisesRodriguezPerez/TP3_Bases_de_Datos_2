        "BODY": "OPEC output for the second half of 1987,\nincluding that of Iraq, will be above the official 16.6 mln\nbarrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday,\nKuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said.\n    Iraq refused to sign the pact, by which OPEC maintained its\nceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters\nof 1987. In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter\nlevel of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quarter\ntarget.\n    Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, \"OPEC third\nquarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd while\nfourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd\"\n    Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production\nlevels would have on prices.\n    Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd,\nrising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused to\nadhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln\nbarrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia\nand Turkey. Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted when\na 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about\nSeptember.\n    Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War\nenemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369\nmln in the second half.\n    Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production from\nthe Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which has\nbeen supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. \"We will\nnot discuss it. There will not be any change,\" he said.\n    Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and ended\nSaturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problems\nto be adressed. \"We are overdoing it in holding too short a\nmeeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet,\" he said.\n    Ali said the problem of price differentials between the\nprices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly\nat the meeting.\n\n    Ali said \"The problem of differentials is a real one. I\nwould hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem\nhas not been dealt with properly. Light crudes are overpriced\nrelative to heavy crudes.\"\n    Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the\nnext OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said\n\"If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not do\nthe work of another minister.\"\n    Kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades.\n    OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1, with a spread\nof 2.65 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes.\n       \n Reuter\n\u0003"
