        "BODY": "Representatives of major U.K. Based banks\nare meeting here today to consider a new plan for reducing the\ncost of financing British exports guaranteed by the Export\nCredits Guarantee Department (ECGD), senior banking sources\nsaid.\n    The plan is being developed in conjunction with the ECGD\nand the Bank of England.\n    Neither the ECGD nor the Bank of England would comment on\nthe plan. However, bankers said one of the main points under\ndiscussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ECGD's medium\nterm credit portfolio in the international capital markets.\n\n    The proposals involve introducing a set of interest margins\non ECGD backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the size\nand maturity of the credit and the currency.\n    The banks are likely to push for a higher margin. Bankers\nsaid that while these rates would reduce a bank's return they\nwould still be more than those proposed about a year ago when\nthe government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate another\ncost reduction plan.\n    At the same time, the banks would be expected to allow the\nECGD to realise additional savings by refinancing existing\ngovernment backed credit in the capital markets.\n\n    On credits that are refinanced an original lender would\nreceive a residual margin of 7/16 pct for loans up to 10 mln\nstg and 3/16 pct on larger transactions.\n\n REUTER\n\u0003"
