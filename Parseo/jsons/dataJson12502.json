He said all types of\ntextiles, textile machinery and associated goods such as sewing\nthread, buttons and collar supports would be placed on the\nduty-free list, effective from April 1.\n    Official sources said the government was also planning to\nabolish import duties on fertiliser and agricultural equipment,\nwith the liberalisation measures would be extended to other\nareas of industry later.\n    The textiles industry dominates Mauritius's Export\nProcessing Zone, and the island has become a major exporter of\nwoollen knitwear.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
