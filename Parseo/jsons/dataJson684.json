        "BODY": "Cuba has told international sugar\noperators who have bought its sugar for shipment in March that\nthese contracts will take second place to Cuba's direct\nshipments to its export markets, dealers here said.\n    Some traders who have received telexes from Cuba said the\nlanguage of the message was not totally clear and some believed\nshipments would be honoured if the traders declare the Soviet\nUnion as the destination of their contracts.\n    The telexes have fueled rising world prices in the last\nweek and reflect a poor Cuban crop, worry over Brazil's export\navailability, and increasing Soviet demand, analysts said.\n    Traders said signs of Cuba's shortage of immediately\navailable raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets was\nprobably the factor behind Syria calling a snap buying tender\nlast month.\n    Normally Syria calls white sugar buying tenders for forward\ndelivery, and last month's spot requirement resulted in the\nsale of several cargoes.\n    Cuba in its telex told operators they would not receive\nMarch shipments as Cuba has to meet its contracts to export\nmarkets, traders said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
