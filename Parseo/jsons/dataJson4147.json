        "BODY": "Jacobs Suchard AG expects a world cocoa\nsurplus of around 100,000 tonnes in 1987 compared with a\n104,000 tonne surplus in 1986, Jens Sroka, head of commodity\nbuying, told a news conference.\n    The company expects prices to remain at around current\nlevels despite the likelihood of agreement on buffer stock\nrules at the forthcoming London cocoa talks, and believes\nmarket intervention by the buffer stock manager would stabilise\nprices.\n    Sroka said world coffee prices are expected to remain weak\nif any international coffee talks fail to produce agreement.\n    Sroka said stagnating consumption and slight overproduction\nwill continue to weigh on coffee prices and he forecast a\ncontinued build-up in stocks.\n    The recent failure of the London coffee talks had surprised\nmarket observers.\n    Unless reason prevails and the major producers return to\nthe conference table, the world coffee market will remain free\nand the consequences for some producers dependant on coffee for\ntheir foreign exchange earnings would be catastrophic, Sroka\nadded.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
