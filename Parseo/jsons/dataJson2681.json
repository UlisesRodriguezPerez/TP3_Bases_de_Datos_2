        "BODY": "The Mississippi River is now open for\nbarge traffic up to the Twin Cities in Minnesota after repairs\nwere completed and the first barges moved upstream through Lock\nand Dam 20 near Quincy, Ill at 0600 CST today, an Army Corps of\nEngineers spokesman said.\n    About 14 to 15 inches of ice were reported between locks\nthree and four on the upper Mississippi River, but other\nsections were generally free of ice, the spokesman said.\n    Midwestern weather has been so mild that barges probably\ncould have kept loading at Mid-Mississippi River terminals\nthrough the winter, if Lock and Dam 20 had not been scheduled\nfor repairs, he said.\n    The Peoria and La Grange locks on the Illinois River are\nstill scheduled to close July 13, for two months of repairs.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
