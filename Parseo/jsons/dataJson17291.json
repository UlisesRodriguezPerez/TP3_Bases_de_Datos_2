        "BODY": "Saudi Arabia will not seek to push OPEC\noil prices above the current benchmark of 18 dlrs per barrel\nunless oil demand grows strongly, the Middle East Economic\nSurvey (MEES) said.\n    The Cyprus-based weekly newsletter quoted authoritative\nSaudi sources as saying the Kingdom's oil price policy would\nnot change \"unless and until there is a strong revival in the\ngrowth of demand for oil.\"\n    MEES said this contradicted recent hints of new Saudi price\nhawkishness from U.S. Congressional and oil industry sources.\n    The Saudi sources said their policy was firmly based on the\nlong-term need to restore the competitive position of oil in\ngeneral and OPEC oil in particular against other energy\nsources.\n    \"Saudi Arabia is certainly committed to cooperating with its\nOPEC partners to exercise the necessary production restraint to\nmaintain the 18 dlr per barrel reference price level,\" MEES\nsaid.\n    The newsletter said Saudi output in the first three weeks\nof April averaged slightly above its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln\nbarrels per day (bpd). Output would fall in the last week,\ncausing the month's average to be below quota, MEES said.\n    MEES estimated overall OPEC production for April at around\n16.8-16.9 mln bpd -- two mln bpd more than both its figures for\nMarch and Reuter estimates for March.\n    It said Iranian production had risen by 500,000 bpd this\nmonth to 2.2-2.3 mln bpd, around its quota level. In Iraq, with\nan OPEC-assigned quota of 1.466 mln bpd, output rose this month\nto two mln bpd, not including \"war relief\" supplies from Kuwait\nand Saudi Arabia, the newsletter said.\n    Nigeria, which has had problems selling its full 1.238 mln\nbpd entitlement, increased its output to 1.2 mln bpd, it added.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
