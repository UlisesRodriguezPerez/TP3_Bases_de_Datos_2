        "BODY": "Bank of Canada Governor John Crow said he\nexpects the Canadian economy will grow moderately in the coming\nyear, despite the near flat growth in the final quarter of\n1986.\n    \"We see moderate growth,\" Crow told a news conference\nfollowing presentation of the central bank's annual report in\nthe House of Commons today.\n    He said there were positive signs of growth in the economy,\nparticularly the drawdown of business inventories in the fourth\nquarter. Yesterday, Statistics Canada reported gross domestic\nproduct expanded a slight 0.2 pct in the quarter.\n    Crow reiterated the bank's previous statements that\ninflation remains a major priority in setting monetary policy\nand said only zero inflation would be acceptable. Canada's\ninflation rate is currently hovering around the four pct mark.\n    The governor said Canada's banking system remains sound\ndespite recent concern about exposure by the country's banks in\ndebt plagued countries such as Brazil.\n    \"It (the debt problem) is not a happy development but I\nthink it can be overplayed in terms of its impact,\" Crow told\nreporters.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
