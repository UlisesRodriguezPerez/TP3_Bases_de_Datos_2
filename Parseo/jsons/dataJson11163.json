        "DATELINE": "    TOKYO, March 31 - ",
        "BODY": "Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said he\nregards a U.S. Dollar below 150 yen as counter to the agreement\nstruck by major nations in Paris last month.\n    He told the Upper House Budget Committee in Parliament that\nJapan intervened in the market when the dollar went below 150\nyen, as it considered the dollar's fall below that level\ncounter to the spirit of the Paris accord.\n    Commenting on current foreign exchange movements, Miyazawa\nsaid Japan would watch developments for another couple of days.\n    Institutional investors appeared to have sold dollars to\nhedge currency risks ahead of the end of the financial year\ntoday, Miyazawa said.\n    Behind the recent dollar fall lies the market perception\nthat major nations were not doing enough to implement their\npolicies under the Paris pact, he said, noting that passage of\nJapan's 1987/88 budget has been delayed.\n    He said that now was the time for major nations to act\nunder the Paris accord. The U.S., West Germany, France,\nSwitzerland and Britain have intervened on their own account to\nprop up the dollar, he said. This was a concerted action.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
