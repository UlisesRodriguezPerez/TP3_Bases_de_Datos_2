        "BODY": "A 10 percentage\npoint reduction in the Australian government's maximum crude\noil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output,\nresources analyst Ian Story said here.\n    A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Strait\noutput to be maintained at the current rate of 420,000 barrels\nper day (BPD) for the next year rather than falling to 380,000\nBPD in 1987/88, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration\nAssociation annual conference.\n    Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydney\nstockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd.\n    Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longer\nappropriate in the current economic climate, Story said.\n    The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discovered\nbefore September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty Co\nLtd <BRKN.S>/Exxon Corp <XON> partnership to shut-in\nproduction, accelerating the decline in output and reducing\ngovernment revenue, he said.\n    He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30\nAustralian dlrs a barrel would rise to 2.07 dlrs from 0.80 dlrs\nif the levy was cut to 70 pct.\n    \"The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractive\nat oil prices below 30 dlrs,\" Story said.\n    Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higher\nlevels of self-sufficiency, increase government revenue, boost\nexports and provide incentives for exploration and development,\nhe said.\n    The government is currently reviewing the oil tax\nstructure.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
