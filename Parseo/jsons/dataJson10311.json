        "BODY": "Japan has sought to assure the U.S. It is\nnot trying to keep foreign equity in a new Japanese\ninternational telecommunications company below the legal limit\nof 33 pct, a Post and Telecommunications ministry official\nsaid.\n    In a letter sent yesterday, Postal Minister Shunjiro\nKarasawa told U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige that the\nministry does not object to foreign participation by those U.S.\nFirms that have expressed interest.\n    But it does oppose any foreign international\ntelecommunications carrier having a management role, he said.\n    The move appears to be an effort to dampen U.S. Opposition\nto the planned merger of two rival firms seeking to compete\nwith the current monopoly <Kokusai Denwa Denshin Co Ltd>, and\nto reduce the share held in any KDD rival by U.K.'s Cable and\nWireless Plc <CAWL.L>, industry analysts and diplomats said.\n    One of the rival firms, <International Telecom Japan Inc>\n(ITJ) has offered a stake in the company to eight U.S. Firms\nincluding General Electric Co <GE>, Ford Motor Co <F> and\nCitibank NA <CCI), and two European companies, ITJ president\nNobuo Ito said yesterday.\n    Cable and Wireless holds a 20 pct share in a second\npotential KDD rival, <International Digital Communications\nPlanning Inc>, along with <C Itoh and Co>. Merrill Lynch and Co\nInc <MER> and Pacific Telesis International Inc <PAC>, both of\nthe U.S., Hold three and 10 pct shares respectively.\n    The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has urged the\nmerger of the two firms because it says the market can only\nsupport a single KDD competitor.\n    It has also rejected management participation by an\ninternational common carrier, such as Cable and Wireless,\narguing no international precedent for such a stake exists.\n    Cable and Wireless Director of Corporate Strategy, Jonathan\nSolomon, yesterday again told ministry officials he opposes a\nmerger proposal that would limit Cable and Wireless' share to\nless than three pct and total foreign participation to about 20\npct, the ministry official said.\n    Channeling the U.S. Firms into a single merged competitor\nwould most probably result in diluting Cable and Wireless'\nshare, industry analysts said.\n    \"Eventually the ministry will get what it wants -- one\ncombined competitor,\" Bache Securities (Japan) Ltd analyst\nDarrell Whitten said.\n    \"Political ... Leverage may get the total foreign share up\nto a certain amount, but you won't find any one company with an\nextraordinarily large holding,\" Whitten said.\n    Western diplomatic sources were more blunt.\n    \"They (the ministry) don't want to see Cable and Wireless\nwith a reasonable share and they think of all sorts of\nstrategies to reduce that share,\" one said.\n    Fumio Watanabe, a senior Keidanren (a leading business\norganization) official who has been trying to arrange the\nmerger, will present a new outline of his proposal on Thursday,\nthe ministry official said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
