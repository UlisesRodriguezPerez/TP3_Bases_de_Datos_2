        "BODY": "The outlook for the West\nGerman economy is relatively bright, with gross national\nproduct expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel\nUniversity's Institute for World Economy said.\n    The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading\neconomic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic\nthan that of the other institutes, some of which have recently\nreduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct.\n    In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export\noutlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's\nstrength against the dollar and other major currencies.\n    \"The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in\nall, limited,\" the report said. \"On the contrary, a slight rise\nin exports can be expected.\"\n    The institute said past experience has shown West German\nexporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by\ncutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting\ntheir product ranges.\n    They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in\neconomic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the\ndecline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow\nthis year.\n    West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed\nadvances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both\nof which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary\npolicy, the institute said.\n    However, it said the labour market would see only a slight\nimprovement because companies will be reluctant to hire\nadditional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by\nagreed reductions in working hours.\n    The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of\nmonetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked\nacceleration of inflation.\n    It also warned that what it called the worldwide\nsynchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new\nglobal recession. It said central banks in industrialized\ncountries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal\nReserve Board's expansionary course.\n    The institute said this in turn was bound to lead\neventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S.\nPolicy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks\nwere likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could\naggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as\nincrease protectionism around the world.\n    Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the\nnegative effects of the global synchronization of monetary\npolicy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of\ngrowth at home.\n    The institute said this could be done by ensuring that\nfiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes\nshould be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and\nwage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than\nin 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary\npressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply\nto about four pct.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
