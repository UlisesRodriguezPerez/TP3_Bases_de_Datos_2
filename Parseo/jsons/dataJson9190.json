        "BODY": "<Placer Pacific Ltd> said it will\nundertake a full feasibility study of Western Australia's Big\nBell gold prospect.\n    Results of an economic evaluation of the find, in which\nPlacer has an option with <Australian Consolidated Minerals\nLtd> (ACM) to earn a 50 pct interest, were encouraging enough\nto warrant a full study, Placer said in a statement.\n    Big Bell, in the Murchison goldfield 540 km north east of\nPerth, was founded in 1904. Between 1937 and 1955 it yielded\n22.8 tonnes of gold and 7.8 tonnes of silver while milling\nabout 30,000 tonnes of ore a month.\n    Placer has said the prospect has an estimated 14 mln tonnes\nof ore with a three-gram-per-tonne concentration accessible by\nopen-pit mining and a further 4.5 mln tonnes with a\n4.4-gram-a-tonne concentration between 300 and 600 meters\nunderground.\n    It said it was obliged to produce the feasibility study no\nlater than December 31 this year by which time it would have\nspent three mln dlrs on Big Bell.\n    If the results are positive and a commitment to develop\nmade then construction would take about 12 months, Placer said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
