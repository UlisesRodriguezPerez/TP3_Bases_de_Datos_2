        "TITLE": "\"BRITANNIA\" COIN TO SELL AT PREMIUM",
        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, March 12 - ",
        "BODY": "The new British one ounce gold coin, the\n\"Britannia,\" will be priced on the basis of the gold price on the\nday of purchase plus a \"competitive premium,\" Treasury officials\nsaid.\n    Value added tax will be levied on all purchases by members\nof the U.K. Public, as is currently the case with foreign\ncoins, although transactions between members of the London Gold\nMarket and all exports of the coins will be zero-rated. No\ndecision has yet been taken on the face value of the coins.\n    Although a number of gold coins, especially the Canadian\nMaple, have been issued elsewhere in an attempt to take the\nplace of the South African krugerrand, the British government\nstill feels that there is a gap in the market for a British one\nounce gold coin. The only British gold coin available at\npresent is the sovereign, which contains 0.2354 ounces of gold.\n    Gold from South Africa or the Soviet Union will not be used\nin the coin, officials said, adding that bullion would be\nbought on the world gold market. But analysts said it would be\ndifficult to ascertain the origins of such purchases.\n    No details are yet available on how many coins will be\nissued or how much gold will be bought, but traders said that\nthe amounts involved would be unlikely to move the gold price.\n    There were some enquiries on the \"Britannia\" from coin\ndealers today, but value added tax would prove a major factor\nin the success of the coin, with the 15 pct tax likely to put\noff many investors, traders said.\n    Some said that the \"Britannia\" had come too late, with the\nCanadian Maple Leaf, the American Eagle and other gold coins\nalready well established.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
