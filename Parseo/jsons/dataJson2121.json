        "BODY": "OPEC output in February was \"well below\"\nthe 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December and all countries\nare strictly adhering to their quotas, the OPEC news agency\nOpecna quoted an OPEC secretariat official as saying.\n    The official was quoted as saying that lower output was the\nresult \"of member countries' firm determination to defend the\norganisation's official price of 18 dlrs per barrel, and to\nrefrain from selling any quantity below that price.\"\n    The unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no\nOPEC meeting was foreseen before the next biannual OPEC session\nplanned to start on June 25.\n    The official gave no figure for February output. The\nstatement said only that \"the reduction in total supplies,\nnamely actual exports of crude oil and products, plus local\ndeliveries in member countries, is even more pronounced as\nthose supplies fell very noticeably during that month.\"\n    \"No matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters\nto align the official selling price to the ongoing market\nprice, member countries are, without exception, strictly\nadhering to the official selling price in spite of the\nfinancial hardship this may entail,\" the statement said.\n    \"The very recent improvement in the price structure is an\nindicator of such determination by the organization to stick to\nthe official selling price,\" the statement said.\n    Free spot market prices rose from around 14.50 dlrs a\nbarrel in early December last year to near OPEC's official\nlevels towards the end of the year, after the OPEC pact.\n    There has been oil industry speculation that OPEC might\nhave to hold an extraordinrary meeting prior to its scheduled\nJune session to discuss reports of overproduction by some\nstates and strains on the differential matrix, which prices\neach OPEC crude according to its quality and distance from main\nmarkets.\n    The official said in the statement that no such emergency\nsession was scheduled \"because of member countries' firm\ndetermination to defend the price (system)\" agreed in December.\n    Opec\"s differential committee was to have met in Vienna\nstarting April 2 but this session has been postponed, with no\nnew date set, according to an official of the United Arab\nEmirates, which chairs the seven-state body.\n    Other members are Algeria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Libya,\nNigeria and Qatar.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
