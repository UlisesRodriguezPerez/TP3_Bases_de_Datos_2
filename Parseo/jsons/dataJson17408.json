        "TITLE": "OIL IMPORT FEE BILL INTRODUCED IN U.S. HOUSE",
        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, April 29 - ",
        "BODY": "A bill that would impose an oil\nimport fee to support a world floor price for oil of 25 dlrs a\nbarrel was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by\n12 Congressmen from oil-producing states.\n    The variable import fee would be dropped if oil prices rise\nabove 25 dlrs a barrel, sponsors of the bill said.\n    Revenues from the fee would be used to buy domestic oil\nfrom stripper wells - those that produce 10 barrels a day or\nless - at a fixed price of 25 dlrs a barrel. Purchases would\nstop when prices rose above that level.\n    \"Time is running out on the domestic oil and gas industry,\"\nRep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said in a statement. \"An oil import\nfee is really just the premium for a national insurance\npolicy.\"\n    President Reagan opposes an oil import fee, but supporters\nof the bill said they hoped for action on it before the end of\nthe year.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
