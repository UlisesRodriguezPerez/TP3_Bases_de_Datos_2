        "BODY": "A new International Natural Rubber\nAgreement, INRA, was formally adopted by a United Nations\nConference today.\n    The new accord is due to replace the current one, which\nexpires in October.\n    Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said the\nformal adoption represented \"a historic moment.\"\n    The latest round of talks, which began March 9, represented\nthe fourth attempt to negotiate a new INRA in nearly two years.\nXuto described the negotiations as \"by no means easy, and we\noften faced problems.\"\n    The new pact is due to enter into force provisionally when\nratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world net\nexports and 75 pct of net imports.\n    The new INRA will enter into force definitively when\ngovernments accounting for at least 80 pct of net exports and\n80 pct of net imports have ratified it.\n    It will be open for signature from May 1 to December 31\nthis year.\n    It is expected that provisional entry into force will take\nat least 12 to 14 months from now, delegates said.\n    During the hiatus between the two agreements buffer stock\noperations will be suspended, but the International Natural\nRubber Council will remain in place.\n    Xuto told the conference both the 1979 agreement and its\nsuccessor were aimed at meeting the needs of producers and\nconsumers of natural rubber over the long term.\n    Both had interest in stabilising prices and supplies, Xuto\nadded. He also praised \"the spirit of 'give' and 'take' that\nprevailed throughout this session.\"\n    Ahmed Farouk of Malaysia, speaking on behalf of producers,\nsaid the conclusion of the new pact showed that the mutuality\nof interests between producers and consumers is now as valid as\nit was when negotiations of the first agreement began in the\n1970s.\n    Farouk said the ability to manage inventories on the basis\nof predictable stable prices is \"a vital consideration for\nmultinational tire companies, whether or not consuming\ncountries as a whole claimed to be no longer so seriously\nconcerned about security of the rubber supply.\"\n    He said producers considered that the 1979 agreement had\nserved the purpose for which it was created.\n    Farouk urged consuming countries to promote early accession\nto the new pact \"to avoid an undue gap between the old and the\nnew.\n    Gerard Guillonneau of France, speaking for consumers,\nagreed that the 1979 agreement had worked relatively well.\n    But as economic conditions had changed, he said, consumers\nhad been led to make proposals for improving its functioning.\n    He added that the adoption of the new agreement \"attests to\nthe importance of rubber and confidence in the rubber industry.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
