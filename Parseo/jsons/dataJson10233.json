        "TITLE": "GREAT AMERICAN <GTAM> SEES CHARGE, WRITEDOWN",
        "DATELINE": "    BATON ROUGE, LA., March 26 - ",
        "BODY": "Great American Corp said\npreliminary findings by regulatory examiners of its AMBANK\nsubsidiary will result in a first quarter charge of 14.1 mln\ndlrs and a writedown of 1.4 mln dlrs.\n    The charge will be made against the allowance for possible\nloan losses, and the writedown is of other real estate.\n    Great American said the examiners were conducting a regular\nexamination and a final report is not expected for several\nweeks. Management intends to include the charge and writedown\nin response to the preliminary findings.\n    Great American said regulatory authorities are not\nrequiring an adjustment of the previously reported financial\nresults for Great American for 1986.\n    However, Great American has revised its previous estimates\nof provisions for possible losses and has added 9.9 mln dlrs to\nthe allowance account as of December 31, 1986. It said it took\nthe action since the charge-offs will significantly deplete its\nallowance for possible loan losses and the economic environment\ndoes not show signs for significant improvement in the near\nfuture.\n    It said the additional provision increases the allowance to\n26.4 mln dlrs, representing 6.63 pct of the outstanding loan\nportfolio and 83.2 pct of non-performing loans at year-end.\n    Great American said its revised net loss for the fourth\nquarter is 14.1 mln dlrs, or 6.36 dlrs per share, compared to a\nnet loss of 2.4 mln dlrs or 1.06 dlrs per share the year\nearlier.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
