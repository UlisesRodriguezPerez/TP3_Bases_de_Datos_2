        "BODY": "The government daily Izvestia said a\nconsiderable amount of Soviet winter crops need to be reseeded\nand the state 1987 grain harvest target of 232 mln tonnes will\nnot be easy to fulfil.\n    Without giving figures, the newspaper said: \"A considerable\npart of the winter crops must be reseeded, but that creates\nextra effort in the fields in spring.\"\n    The Soviet Union has previously said nine mln hectares of\nwinter grain will have to be reseeded because of winterkill.\n    A U.S. Department of Agriculture analyst in Washington has\nsaid the figure of nine mln hectares would equal about 25 pct\nof the total winter crop and would be the second highest\nwinterkill in 10 years.\n    \"The planned task of bringing in no less than 232 mln tonnes\nof grain is not simple,\" Izvestia said.\n    This week's sudden fall in temperatures has affected large\nparts of the country and has caused fieldwork to stop in the\nUkraine, it said, adding that temperatures fell to as low as\nminus 30 centigrade in Byelorussia.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
