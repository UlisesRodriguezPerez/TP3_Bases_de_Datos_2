        "BODY": "U.S. trade representative Clayton\nYeutter said Canada's finding announced today that U.S. corn\nimports injure Canadian farmers is \"totally unjustified.\"\n    \"U.S. corn exports to Canada are so small that it is\ninconceivable that they injure Canadian corn farmers by any\nreasonable measure,\" Yeutter said in a statement.\n    He said if other countries follow Canada's lead it could\nresult in \"a rash of protectionist actions throughout the\nworld.\" French corn growers have recently indicated they will\nchallenge U.S. corn gluten feed shipments to Europe.\n    Yeutter said the U.S. will examine the Canadian decision\nclosely and if the U.S. believes the decision was not based on\nfacts, \"will carefully evaluate appropriate responses.\" Yeutter\ndid not say what steps the U.S. may take in response.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
