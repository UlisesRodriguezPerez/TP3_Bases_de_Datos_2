        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, April 5 - ",
        "BODY": "U.S. and Japanese officials meet\ntomorrow to try to settle a dispute over semiconductor trade\nand to cut short the 300 mln dlr penalty tariffs President\nReagan has ordered imposed on Japanese exports.\n    But U.S. officials held out little hope that any accord\ncould be reached before the tariffs of 100 per cent - up from\nabout five per cent - are to take effect on April 17.\n    The Customs Bureau last week started to levy a bond on the\nJapanese goods that Reagan ordered penalized. The penalties\nwould be retroactive to March 31.\n    Reagan said on March 27 when ordering the tariffs that he\nhoped the Japanese would soon end their unfair practices in\nsemiconductor trade and that sanctions could be lifted.\n    Technical meetings are to be held today and tomorrow, with\nmeetings at a more senior level scheduled for Thursday and\nFriday. Public hearings on the sanctions are set for April 13.\n    The Japanese aides here for the technical talks include\nShigeru Muraoka, director-general of international trade policy\nof the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), and\nMasashi Yamamoto, deputy director-general of the information\nand machinery bureau.\n    Meeting with them will Glen Fukushima, director of the\nJapan office of the U.S. Trade Representative's Office, and Jim\nGradoville, of trade representative's office of industry and\nservices.\n    The two sides in the Thursday and Friday talks will be\nheaded by Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and\nMITI vice minister Makoto Kuroda.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003"
