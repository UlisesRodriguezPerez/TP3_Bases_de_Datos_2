        "BODY": "Currency fluctuations may reassert their\ninfluence on the bullion market in the near future, bullion\nbankers Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd said in a market report.\n    But the firm said silver may lag behind gold in any\nreactions to movements on foreign exchanges.\n    \"OPEC's failure to address the recent decline in oil prices\nremains a worrying factor however, and on balance it appears\nthat the market should be approached cautiously,\" Montagu said.\n    The bank said the US economy has shown no noticeable\nlong-term improvement and that both Latin American debt and the\nIranian arms affair could undermine confidence in the dollar.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
