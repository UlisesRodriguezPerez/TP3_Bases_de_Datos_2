        "BODY": "The West German government today considered\ndemands for nearly 850 mln marks to lay off or retrain 20,000\nsteel workers.\n    Government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said Chancellor Helmut\nKohl reviewed a joint proposal by steel employers and trade\nunions at a special meeting with steel industry\nrepresentatives.\n    Companies like Fried Krupp <KRPG.D> and Hoesch Werke AG\n<HWKG.F>, which saw profits plunge last year, have taken the\nunusual step of aligning with the metalworkers' trade union, IG\nMetall, to press for government finance to slim staff levels\nstill further.\n    Government officials said Bonn was prepared to take part in\na common effort to find a solution for the steelworkers. But\nsince the government was struggling to finance tax cuts by\nreducing state subsidies, it could not pay for all the layoffs.\n    A spokesman for IG Metall said the joint proposal foresaw\nredundancy payments to 10,000 workers in Ruhr and Rhineland\nplants. Some 6,000 workers would be redeployed in non-steel\nmaking sectors of steel companies, while a further 4,000 would\nbe eligible for job-retraining schemes. Redundancies are\nestimated at 600 mln marks, while job retraining would cost a\nfurther 240 mln.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
