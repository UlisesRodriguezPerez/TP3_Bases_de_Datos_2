        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, March 26 - ",
        "BODY": "The release of U.K. February trade data\nshowing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376\nmln stg, up from a 73 mln surplus in January, has boosted hopes\nof an early cut in interest rates, analysts said.\n    Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome, with\nexpectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750\nmln stg, against the official figure of 224 mln stg, sharply\nnarrower than January's 527 mln deficit.\n    \"The figures are unreservedly good,\" Chase Manhattan\nSecurities economist Andrew Wroblewski said.\n    Sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weaker\nmorning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted index\nagainst a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged from\nyesterday's close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level.\n    The market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil trade\npattern would undermine international support for sterling,\nwhich has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K.\nInterest rates. Money market sources said the market had begun\nto doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates\nto 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.\n    But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.\n    There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the\nExchequer Nigel Lawson's forecast of a 1987 current account\ndeficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, said Wroblewski.\n    Seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in\nFebruary to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.\n    Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.\n    However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and\nDrew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would\nprove partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the\nChancellor's Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture\non imported goods.\n    However, Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, said\nhis firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit\nforecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion\nstg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.\n    He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods\nconfirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the\nConfederation of British Industry.\n    The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if\nJanuary's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas\ngoods and import-intensive stock building among manufactureres,\nHarwood said.\n    U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2\npoint on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries\nabout the figures evaporated.\n    Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling\nto a steady 1.6050 dlrs about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher\nthan the European low of 1.5960.\n    However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market\nsentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.\n    Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was\nlargely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the\nConservative government's support was slipping.\n    The Marplan poll, published in \"Today,\" showed Conservative\nsupport had fallen to 36 pct, from 38 pct last month, while the\nAlliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31\npct, from 21 pct, to run neck and neck with the Labour Party,\nwhose own support fell from 38 pct.\n    The poll was taken after the Budget, which was greeted\nenthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left\nthe voters indifferent, political observers said.\n    Another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warn\nthat today's improved sentiment could be dented if support for\nPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again.\n    This upsetting of the markets' political perceptions, which\nare all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcoming\ngeneral election, made them more sensitive to the trade data,\nHarwood said. \"The news did come as a very, very substantial\nrelief,\" he said.\n    However, on the interest rate front, economists caution\nthat Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by\nencouraging another base rate fall. They noted Lawson had\nalready got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in\nresponse to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons for\nlower rates have been curtailed.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
