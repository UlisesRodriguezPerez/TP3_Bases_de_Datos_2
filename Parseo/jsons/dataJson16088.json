        "BODY": "Japan warned the United States it may\ntake retaliatory measures if the United States imposes its\nplanned trade sanctions on April 17, a senior government\nofficial said.\n    Shinji Fukukawa, Vice Minister of the International Trade\nand Industry Ministry, said in a statement Japan would consider\nmeasures under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and\nother actions if the United States imposes 100 pct tariffs on\nsome Japanese exports as planned next week.\n    However, Fukukawa said Japan was ready to continue trade\ntalks with the United States despite its failure to convince\nAmerica to call off the threatened tariffs during two days of\nemergency talks which ended in Washington yesterday.\n    Last month President Reagan announced the sanctions in\nretaliation for what he called Japan's failure to honour a July\n1986 agreement to stop dumping computer microchips in markets\noutside the United States and to open its home market to\nAmerican goods.\n    Fukukawa said the United States had regrettably not\nlistened to Japan's explanation of its efforts to live up the\npact and said Washington had not given any detailed explanation\nof why it planned to impose the tariffs.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
