        "TITLE": "EC TO OFFER ARGENTINA GRAIN SALE COMPENSATION",
        "DATELINE": "    BRUSSELS, April 24 - ",
        "BODY": "The European Community is to offer\nArgentina compensation for its loss of maize and sorghum\nexports to Spain following Spain's accession to the EC, EC\nsources said.\n    They said the offer will be made next week in Geneva,\nheadquarters of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n(GATT), and will also involve products other than cereals. They\ngave no further details.\n    Argentine exports of sorghum to Spain fell to zero last\nyear from 300,000 tonnes in 1985, while maize sales fell to\n15,000 tonnes from 994,000, official EC statistics show.\n    The sources noted that an agreement between the EC and the\nU.S. guarantees special access to the Spanish market for two\nmln tonnes of non-EC maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum each\nyear for the next four years.\n    But they said various details of this accord will tend to\ninhibit imports from Argentina.\n    These include a provision for reduction of the amounts if\nSpain imports cereals substitutes, and the EC's plan to import\nthe special maize and sorghum on a regular monthly basis.\nArgentina tends to have exportable quantities only three or\nfour times a year.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
