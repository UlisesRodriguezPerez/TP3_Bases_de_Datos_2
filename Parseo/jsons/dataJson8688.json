        "BODY": "Iran has test-fired its newly acquired\nSilkworm anti-shipping missile in the Strait of Hormuz and has\nset up at least two land-based launching sites in the area, a\nBritish naval source in the Gulf said.\n    The source, who declined to be identified, said Iran had\nfired the Chinese-made missile at a hulk off its southern Gulf\nnaval port of Bandar Abbas and scored a hit.\n    \"These missiles pack a fairly big punch,\" he told Reuters.\n\"There is no doubt they could be used to target (shipping)\nacross the Strait of Hormuz.\"\n    Tension in the Gulf has risen since U.S. Officials last\nweek broke the news that Iran had acquired the Silkworm\nmissiles.\n    The U.S. Has said it will not allow Iran to use the\nmissiles to choke off oil shipments and has offered its\nwarships to escort Kuwaiti tankers past the missile batteries.\n    But Tehran denied last Sunday it intended to threaten Gulf\nshipping and warned the U.S. Any interference in the region\nwould meet a strong response.\n    The British naval source said the Silkworms were in place\nat at least two sites around the Strait of Hormuz, but would\nnot give the exact location.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
