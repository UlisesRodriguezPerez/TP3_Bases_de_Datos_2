        "TITLE": "U.S. BANKER PREDICTS FURTHER DOLLAR FALL THIS YEAR",
        "DATELINE": "    ABU DHABI, March 28 - ",
        "BODY": "A leading U.S. Banker said the dollar\nwas likely to fall another five to 10 pct this year and an\nimprovement in the huge American trade deficit would be only\ntemporary at current world exchange rate levels.\n    Kurt Viermetz, Worldwide Treasurer of <Morgan Guaranty\nTrust Co>, told Arab currency traders meeting here that the\nsteady depreciation of the dollar had not gone far enough to\nrein in U.S. Deficits on a lasting basis.\n    Speaking at the 14th annual congress of the Interarab\nCambist Association, Viermetz said an agreement reached last\nmonth among major industrial nations to steady the dollar\naround current levels left many questions unanswered.\n    \"I cannot see any chance for a real turnaround (rise) in the\ndollar,\" Viermetz said. \"I believe there is room for a further\nfall of five to 10 per cent in 1987.\"\n    The United States, West Germany, Japan, France, Great\nBritain and Canada -- G-6 -- agreed in Paris in late February\nto stabilise major currencies around current levels.\n    The accord came after months of transatlantic argument,\nwith Tokyo and Bonn claiming Washington's policy of talking the\ndollar lower had made life impossible for West German and\nJapanese exporters.\n    The Paris accord also brought a pause to the continued\nslide of the dollar engineered by a meeting in New York in\nSeptember 1985 when industrial nations agreed to depress the\nvalue of the currency to help redress global trade imbalances.\n    But Viermetz said Morgan Guaranty's economic models showed\nthat with no further change in exchange rates -- and continued\nsluggish growth in West Germany and Japan -- the U.S. Trade\ndeficit would improve only temporarily.\n    He said the deficit might fall to 145 billion dlrs this\nyear from 165 billion in 1986 and further improve to 120\nbillion in 1988 but by 1990, it would be back around 160\nbillion dlrs.\n    \"This is clearly unacceptable for the monetary authorities\nand politicians in Washington,\" he said.\n    Viermetz said it was only natural that markets should\nattempt to test the credibility of the Paris accord, struck\nwhen the dollar was trading at about 1.83 marks and 152.50 yen.\n    Immediately before the historic 1985 New York agreement or\n\"Plaza Accord,\" the dollar had been trading at 2.84 marks and 240\nyen.\n    Viermetz said he believed major nations in Paris wanted to\nsee the dollar hold within a \"loose range\" of 1.75 to 1.90 marks\nand 145 to 155 yen, with any attempt to push the U.S. Currency\nlower being countered by central bank intervention.\n    The dollar ended in New York yesterday at 147.15/25 yen --\nits lowest level against the Japanese currency in roughly 40\nyears. It closed at 1.8160/70 marks.\n    Viermetz also said he did not see the U.S. Federal funds\nrate falling below six pct for fear of provoking an\nuncontrolled fall in the dollar.\n    But at the same time, worries about the international debt\ncrisis would mean there was little chance of a rise above 6-3/4\npct since this would increase loan costs to the third world.\n    The Middle East foreign exchange conference brings together\nmore than 200 traders and bank treasury chiefs from the Arab\nworld and Arab banks in European and U.S. Financial centres.\n    Formal discussions, which end today, have also centred on\nthe role of Arab banks in world financial markets, with bankers\nurging them to adapt to a new global trend towards\nsecuritisation of  business.\n    Hikmat Nashashibi, President of the Arab Bankers\nAssociation, said Arab banks have to shake off their old\nmentality of commercial banking and concentrate more on\ninvestment banking.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
