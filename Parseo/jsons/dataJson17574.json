        "TITLE": "MAXWELL FILES SUIT TO STOP HARCOURT <HBJ>",
        "DATELINE": "    New York, June 1 - ",
        "BODY": "Publisher Robert Maxwell's British\nPrinting and Communicaton Corp PLC said it filed a lawsuit in\nU.S. district court against Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc, its\ndirectors and advisers to stop, among other things, payment of\nthe special dividend Harcourt is paying as part of its\nrecapitalization.\n    The suit, filed in Manhattan, also names First Boston Corp\n<FBC> and seeks to void the issue by Harcourt of 40,000 shares\nof super voting preferred stock to First Boston Securities Corp\nand the issue of convertible voting preferred stock with\n4,700,000 votes in the Harcourt employee stock ownership plan.\n    The preferred shares to be issued to First Boston have\n8,160,000 votes. The suit, brought derivatively on behalf of\nHarcourt and individually in British Printing's capacity as a\nsubstantial holder of Harcourt common shares and 6-3/8 pct\nconvertible debentures.\n    The suit alleges Harcourt's special dividend exceeds by\nmore than one billion dlrs Harcout's surplus available for\ndividends under New York law and contstitutes a fraudulent\nconveyance.\n    The lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose\nthat one consequence of the payment of the dividend, which it\nterms illegal, will be that shareholders will be liable to\nrepay it.\n    Harcourt last week said it would pay 40 dlrs per share to\nstockholders as a special dividend. Harcourt also announced an\nextensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimed\nat thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing.\n    British Printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share,\nor two billion dlr offer for Harcourt because of the\nrecapitalizaton plan. At the time, it said it was reviewing its\nalternatives.\n    British Printing said it filed the suit after consultation\nwith its advisers. Its lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt\nfailed to disclose the effect of the special dividend on\nHarcourt 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures.\n    British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormous\nincrease effective on the June eight record date for the\ndividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable upon\nconversion of the debentures. British Printing also charged \nHarcourt is unlawfully coercing debenture holders to convert\ndenbentures before the record date because Harcourt may not\nhave enough authorized common shares to honor conversion after\nthe date.\n    British Printing holds 460,600 shares and 5.6 mln dlrs\nworth of debentures.\n    The suit also alleges that management, the board of\ndirectors, and First Boston engaged in an illegal scheme of\nentrenchment through a combination of selling to First Boston\nSecurities Corp the super voting preferred at a bargain price,\nthe grant to the company employee stock plan of convertible\nvoting preferred, the six mln share open market repurchase\nprogram and the manner in which its financing has been\nstructured.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
