        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, June 2 - ",
        "BODY": "House Speaker Jim Wright predicted\npassage of legislation requiring the Reagan administration to\nprovide Congress with a report on its Mideast Gulf policy, but\na last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberals and\nconservatives left the bill's fate in doubt.\n    The legislation was written in the wake of the May 17th\nIraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,\nwhich killed 37 Americans, and President Reagan's decision to\nprotect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags\n-- effectively making them American ships.\n    Since the administration made known its reflagging plans,\ncongressional leaders complained they had not been consulted,\nand some charged the policy could lead the United States into\nthe 6 1/2-year-old war between Iran and Iraq.\n    The House was to vote today on a bill -- supported by the\nDemocratic and Republican congressional leadership and the\nadministration -- which demanded a report within seven days on\nplans to meet the security needs of U.S. forces in the gulf.\n    The resolution was expected to pass without controversy\ntoday in the House Foreign Affairs Committee before the full\nHouse was to take up the bill. But in a surprise move, liberal\nDemocrats and conservative Republicans on the committee joined\nin an unusual alliance to oppose the resolution.\n    Liberal Democrats said a lack of any restrictions in the\nbill implied consent to Reagan's policies.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
