        "BODY": "<Royal Bank of Canada>, in reporting a\n19 pct drop in first quarter earnings, said it expects to\nreport improved results in future earnings periods.\n    \"Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income,\nhighly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, and\na solid capital position...combined with the restraint of\nnon-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in the\nperiods ahead,\" chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement.\n    The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter\nended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year\nago.\n    Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to\nsubstantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank's\ninternational operations remains weak, reflecting\nresource-related difficulties of private and public sector\nborrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market\nactivities.\n    The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103\nmln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while\nearnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs\nfrom 42 mln dlrs last year.\n    Royal Bank said first quarter international net interest\nincome declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenues\nfrom international investment banking as well as a significant\nloss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago.\n    Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last\nyear. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail\ndeposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue but\nlower securities commissions from international investment bank\noperations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said.\n    The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to\n98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in\nconsumer lending, particularly residential mortgages.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
