        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 31 - ",
        "BODY": "Unfavorable late winter weather\nconditions in the main wheat growing areas of Yugoslavia\nindicate dimmed prospects for the emerging winter wheat crop,\nthe U.S. embassy's agricultural officer in Belgrade said.\n    The officer, who travelled through an area from Belgrade to\nSubotica, said in a field report dated March 27 the wheat crop\nhad been set back at least three weeks because of a cold spell\nthat followed a period of warm weather.\n    He said unseasonably warm weather in late February that\nbrought the wheat crop out of winter dormancy early was\nfollowed by three weeks of unusually cold weather.\n    Damaging effects were seen in the fields, most of which\nshow stands with a yellow-brown cast indicating extensive leaf\nand possible root damage from repeated freezings, he said.\n    The report said that since much of the early growth in\nFebruary was from late seeding rather than from normal\ndevelopment, his view was that the damage may be more extensive\nthan some local observers say.\n    The most seriously affected fields were late-seeded fields\non normal maize soils. Stands in these fields were thin and\nchances of recovery appeared less favorable, he said.\n    However, he said soil moisture conditions were favorable\nand many of the fields had already been top-dressed, which\nwould aid recovery.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
