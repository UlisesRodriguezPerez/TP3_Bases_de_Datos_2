        "BODY": "The Senate voted to condemn the\nproposed European common market tax on vegetable and marine\nfats and oils and said it would result in retaliation.\n    The non-binding Senate resolution, a sense of Senate\nsentiment, was approved on a 99 to 0 vote.\n    \"The administration should communicate to the European\nCommunity the message that the United States will view the\nestablishment of such a tax as inconsistent with the European\nCommunity's obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs\nand Trade that will result in the adoption of strong and\nimmediate countermeasures,\" the resolution stated.\n    The resolution said the European Community Commission has\nproposed establishing a consumption tax on vegetable and fish\noils and fats in conjunction with the setting of farm prices\nfor the 1987/1988 EC marketing year.\n    The Senate said the tax would amount to almost 90 pct of\nthe current price of soyoil and \"have a restrictive effect\" on\nU.S. exports of soybeans and vegetable oils to the EC.\n    It would be \"blatantly inconsistent\" with obligations of the\nEC under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, the\nresolution said, and \"constitute another egregious attempt\" to\nimpose EC agricultural costs on trading partners.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
