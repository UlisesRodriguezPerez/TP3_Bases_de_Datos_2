        "BODY": "A representative of the poultry\nindustry said statistics showed that chicken is less frequently\nthe cause of salmonella poisoning than beef, dairy products or\nsalads and other mixed foods.\n    Kenneth May, President of Holly Farms Poultry Industries\nand a director of the National Broiler Council, told a House\nAgriculture subcommittee the incidence of salmonella in chicken\nhas not increased in recent years and that chicken is neither\nthe major source of the bacterial poisoning nor the cause of an\nincrease in outbreaks of the disease.\n    May said the Center for Disease Control figures showed that\nbetween 1978 and 1982, chicken was involved in four pct of all\nU.S. salmonellosis outbreaks, while beef accounted for ten pct\nof outbreaks and dairy products six pct.\n    May said the remaining outbreaks were caused by salads and\nmixed food, turkey, seafood, pork, eggs and other foods.\n    May said the chicken industry favored moving away from\nbird-by-bird inspection procedures to a risk assessment system\nbetter able to identify microbial and bacterial contamination\nof poultry.\n    However, Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for\nFood and Health Policy, said bird-by-bird inspection should be\nretained and labels should be attached to each ready-to-cook\nchicken to remind consumers about preparation procedures\nnecessary to avoid illness.\n    Haas also called for a review of present chicken industry\ninspection methods that she said can worsen poultry hazards.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
