        "TITLE": "ARCO <ARC> SPIN-OFF SEEN AT 500 MLN DLRS",
        "AUTHOR": "    By Samuel Fromartz, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, June 18 - ",
        "BODY": "Atlantic Richfield Co, considering a\nspin-off of a 20 pct interest in its chemical operations, could\ngain about 500 mln dlrs from the deal, industry analysts\nestimated.\n    Yesterday ARCO's stock jumped as much as five points on\nrumors it was spinning off the chemical operations. Based on\nabout 183 mln outstanding shares, the market in its frenzy was\nvaluing the spin-off at about 900 mln dlrs, analysts said.\n    Atlantic Richfield, aware of the rumors, issued a statement\naround mid-day that it was considering a sale of only 20 pct of\nthe unit, leading investors to take profits.\n    After the announcement, the company's stock retreated,\nclosing at 93-7/8, up 1-3/8. Today it was off 1/4.\n    \"It was a smaller deal than expected and somewhat\ndisappointing,\" said analyst George Baker at Smith Barney. He\nsaid rumors of the spin-off had been around \"for a couple of\ndays.\"\n    Baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn't\ngetting the type of exposure Atlantic Richfield sought, and its\nvalue was not reflected in the company's stock price.\n    Industry analyst Richard Pzena of Sanford C. Bernstein said\nthe unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year and\nhe expected it to earn about 175 mln dlrs this year.\n    Based on a multiple of 17 times earnings--which Pzena says\nchemical companies now sell for--the entire unit is worth about\nthree billion dlrs, putting the 20 pct interest at around 500\nto 600 mln dlrs.\n    Pzena said he thought the company was selling the stake\nbecause chemical margins had peaked, and he speculated the\ncompany would use the proceeds to pay down debt.\n    But he added the possibility remained the deal would fall\nthrough. Yesterday, ARCO said the proposal had not yet been\npresented to its board.\n    The chemical unit last year had revenues of 1.9 billion\ndlrs.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003"
