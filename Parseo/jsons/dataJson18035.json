        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, June 2 - ",
        "BODY": "The House Agriculture Committee voted\nto make approximately 2.8 billion dlrs of feedgrains deficiency\npayments immediately instead of in the late fall.\n    A similar measure was decisively defeated on the Senate\nfloor last week.\n    The bill, which passed by a voice vote, would allow\nso-called Findley payments to be made immediately rather than\nlate this year. Payments for 1987-90 feedgrains crops would not\nbe changed.\n    Because the bill would move 2.8 billion dlrs of spending\ninto fiscal 1987 from fiscal 1988, the measure is expected to\nmeet stiff resistance in the full House.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003"
