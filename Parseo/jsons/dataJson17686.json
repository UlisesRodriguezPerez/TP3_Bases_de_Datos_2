        "BODY": "Canada's softwood lumber will become\nunprofitable for some forest product producers if prices\ndecline to about 175 U.S. dlrs per thousand board feet of two\nby four inch lumber from current levels of about 195 U.S. dlrs,\nCanadian Forest Industry Council chairman Adam Zimmerman told\nreporters.\n    Zimmerman reiterated profitability has been hurt by a move\nby Canadian negotiators to impose last January a 15 pct export\ntax on softwood lumber shipped to the U.S. in exchange for a\nU.S. lumbermen's lobby dropping its request for a countervail\nduty.\n    \"I think that there has been a falling off in the market, so\nI think there is a moderate slow down in the price now,\"\nZimmerman said at a media briefing.\n    Zimmerman said the adverse impact from lower U.S. lumber\nproduct prices would be felt by lumber mills in eastern Canada\nfirst, migrating westward.\n    \"The country has swallowed a time bomb and it will go off\nwhen times get tough,\" Zimmerman said.\n    He also said the federal government should maintain the\nexisting 15 pct export tax and not allow provinces to offset\nthe tax with increased provincial fees for cutting lumber.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
