        "BODY": "President Reagan is expected to tell\nPrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone this week that the U.S. May be\nable to lift trade sanctions against Japan by the end of June,\nthe New York Times said.\n    The newspaper, quoting administration officials, said that\nunder such a scenario the President would announce just before\nthe June 8-10 economic summit meeting in Venice that he hoped\nto lift the restrictions on electronics imports by the end of\nthe month. Japan, for its part, would have to show that it had\nstopped underpricing semiconductors and had widened access in\nJapan for U.S. Chip producers.\n    The U.S. Administration imposed 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln\ndlrs worth of Japanese color television sets, motorised tools\nand personal computers on April 17.\n    Japanese officials have said Nakasone's main demand when he\narrives for talks with Reagan on Wednesday would be the\nimmediate lifting of the tariffs.\n    But with Congress planning further trade reprisals against\nJapanese trade policies, the end-of-June timeframe is seen as\nthe best Reagan can offer, the Times said. It said some verbal\nformulation was expected to be found in a communique that would\nallow Nakasone to claim at least a modest victory.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
