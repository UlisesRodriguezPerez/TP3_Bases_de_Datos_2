        "BODY": "<Noranda Inc> said a copper\nmine fire that killed one miner and trapped 44 others for\nnearly a day caused an estimated 10 mln Canadian dlrs in\ndamage.\n    The fire, which started Wednesday and burned for more than\n24 hours, destroyed the mine's three-year-old conveyor system,\nofficials said.\n    Michel Lefebvre, vice president of operations, said Noranda\nwill operate the mine at about one-third of its normal 72,000\nmetric ton annual finished capacity, using above ground\nreserves, until it decides whether to keep the mine open.\n    \"The events we sustained yesterday and the day before are a\nvery serious setback for Gaspe Mines operations,\" Lefebvre said.\nGaspe Mines is the name of the Noranda division that operates\nthe Murdochville mine.\n    He said it would take four or five months to bring\noperations up to full capacity if the company decides to do so,\nadding that he believes there is a good chance Noranda will\nfully reopen the mine.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
