        "DATELINE": "    ZURICH, April 3 - ",
        "BODY": "Swiss inflation is likely to rise in 1987\nand 1988 because of inflationary tendencies in the domestic\neconomy, the Centre for Economic Research of the Federal\nInstitute of Technology said in its spring review.\n    It forecast a rise in consumer prices of two pct in 1988\ncompared with 1.3 pct in 1987. Low import prices in 1986 helped\nto keep annual inflation down to 0.8 pct.\n    The centre said that in general the outlook for the Swiss\neconomy in 1987 and 1988 remained favourable, despite the more\ndifficult international economic climate facing export\nindustry.\n    The centre repeated its previous forecast that growth in\nSwiss domestic product would slow to 2.2 pct in 1987 from 2.5\npct in 1986. It revised its forecast for 1988 GDP growth to 1.7\npct from 1.6 pct in its last autumn review.\n    Domestic demand will continue to replace exports as the\nmotor of economic growth. Private consumption will grow by\nthree pct in 1987 and two pct in 1988 against 3.75 pct in 1986.\n    Growth in goods exports will slow to 1.75 pct in 1987 from\n2.1 pct in 1986 but pick up slightly to 2.5 pct in 1988. All\nthree figures are well below the Swiss average for recent\nyears. In 1985, for example, exports increased by 9.1 pct.\n    The centre said the strength of the Swiss franc, which has\nfirmed sharply in recent months, would continue to put pressure\non Swiss exporters.\n    It forecast that imports of goods would grow by a more\nmodest 4.5 pct in 1987 and 3.25 pct in 1988 than in 1986, when\nimport prices fell substantially and imports rose by 8.2 pct.\n    Industrial production will grow by 1.6 pct in 1987 and 1.2\npct in 1988 compared with 4.2 pct in 1986.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
