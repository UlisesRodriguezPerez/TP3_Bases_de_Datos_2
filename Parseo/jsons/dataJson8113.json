        "BODY": "Economics Minister Martin Bangemann said\nthe state could not continue to pour money into West Germany's\nailing steel and coal industries because the subsidies\nendangered other parts of the economy.\n    \"The situation is completely absurd from an economic point\nof view,\" Bangemann told the newspaper Die Welt in an interview\nreleased ahead of publication tomorrow.\n    \"We are subsidising the production of mineral coal and steel\nto an enormous extent and at the same time putting a huge\nburden on all other branches of industry and making them\nuncompetitive,\" he said.\n    Bangemann said the steel and coal industries were no longer\ncapable of being competitive. Continued state subsidies would\nnot save them but would only prolong their lives artifically\nfor a few years, he said.\n    \"That is why I have refused to continue subsidising them in\nthe way that we have done in the past,\" he said.\n    Several steel firms have announced plans to reduce their\nworkforces, citing weak prices and lower exports due to the\nstrength of the mark and tough foreign competition.\n    Bangemann said everything possible would be done to find\nnew jobs for the workers affected by the cuts.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
