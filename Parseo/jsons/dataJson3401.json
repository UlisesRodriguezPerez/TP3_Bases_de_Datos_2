        "BODY": "Grain analysts said the increase of\nthree mln tonnes in 1986/87 Soviet grain imports is unlikely to\naffect the market Tuesday.\n    They said the market already has discounted higher Soviet\nimports, partly on news last month that the Soviet Union bought\none mln tonnes of U.S. corn, and on rumors that the Reagan\nadministration is pushing for authority to sell the Soviets\nU.S. wheat under the Export Enhancement Program.\n    In its supply-demand report, the USDA raised its estimate\nfor 1986/87 Soviet grain imports to 26 mln tonnes from 23 mln.\n    \"That was business already done, for all practical\npurposes,\" said Drexel Burnham analyst Dale Gustafson,\nreflecting similar statements made by other analysts.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
