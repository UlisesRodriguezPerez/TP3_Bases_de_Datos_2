        "BODY": "Paul Volcker's decision not to go for a\nthird term as Federal Reserve Chairman and the nomination of\nAlan Greenspan to replace him have revived deep concerns about\nthe U.S.' ability to prevent a further dollar decline and stem\nrising inflation, financial market analysts said.\n    Although Greenspan is known as a committed anti-inflation\nfighter in the Volcker mould, doubts are already surfacing in\nthe U.S. financial markets as to whether he has enough\npolitical clout and monetary experience to wage a tough\ncampaign against inflation over the next year or two.\n    \"The critical issue is how (Greenspan) will deal with\ninflation,\" said Stephen Axilrod, Vice Chairman of Nikko\nSecurities Co International Inc and former staff director for\nmonetary and financial policy at the Fed.\n    \"A lot of questions have been raised by Volcker's\ndeparture. Until Greenspan answers them, the markets will\nremain nervous,\" added Stephen Slifer, money market economist\nat Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.\n    This morning's announcement sent the dollar into a\ntailspin, which was halted only by concerted central bank\nintervention in the open currency market.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003"
