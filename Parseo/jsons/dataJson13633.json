The remainder of the\nrefinery, including the 19,000 catalytic cracker, was\nundamaged.\n    He said inquiries into the accident, which happened while\nthe hydrocracker was not in operation, were continuing.\n    In an earlier incident, two people were killed in an\nexplosion and fire at the refinery on March 13.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
