        "BODY": "The leaders of two of Japan's top business\ngroups said in separate statements the Group of Seven (G-7)\naccord reached in Washington yesterday is of deep concern to\nJapan because it shows the major industrial nations regard the\nyen's current level as appropriate.\n    Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of Economic\nOrganizations (Keidanren), said the yen's present rate is well\nabove adequate levels. He did not elaborate.\n    Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee for\nEconomic Development, said the accord will not prevent the yen\nfrom rising further.\n    \"We do not understand why the G-7 approved present rates as\nthe yen has risen excessively since the Paris accord,\" Ishihara\nsaid.\n    G-7 members Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S.\nAnd West Germany said in a statement they consider their\ncurrencies are now within ranges broadly consistent with\neconomic fundamentals.\n    Saito called on each G-7 member nation to prepare to\nintervene in the market strongly enough to ensure exchange\nrates are stabilised at appropriate levels.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
