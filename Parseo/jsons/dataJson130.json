        "BODY": "Coleco Industries Inc said\nit expects to return to profitability in 1987.\n    Earlier, Coleco reported a net loss of 111.2 mln dlrs for\nthe year ended December 31 compared to a profit of 64.2 mln\ndlrs in the year earlier.\n    In a prepared statement, the company said the dramatic\nswing in operating results was due primarily to the steep\ndecline in sales of Cabbage Patch Kids products from 600 mln\ndlrs to 230 mln dlrs.\n    Coleco said it changed from a single product company to a\nmore diversified organization through four major acquisitions\nlast year.\n    Products from the new acquisitions and other new product\nintroductions are expected to enable it to return to\nprofitability, it said.\n    At the annual Toy Fair earlier this month, vice president\nMorton Handel said analysts' 1987 projected earnings of 90 cts\na share on sales of 600 mln dlrs are reasonable.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003"
