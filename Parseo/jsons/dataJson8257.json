        "BODY": "Rain over wide areas has raised the\nprospect of good food crops throughout Ethiopia, which suffered\na disastrous drought and famine two years ago.\n    Aweke Aynalem, head of the government's Agriculture\nDevelopment Department, told reporters prospects were good for\nattaining the target of 250,000 tonnes of grain in the present\ngrowing season, one of two each year in Ethiopia.\n    Normal crop production in Ethiopia is about 648,000 tonnes\na year, of which 250,000 tonnes are produced from the \"belg\"\n(small) rains which fall at this time of year.\n    The belg rains are used to plant quick-maturing crops like\nmaize and barley. Any shortfall during this period affects\nproduction in the main rainy season, because farmers eat their\nstocks of seed.\n    Aweke said peasants in Wello, Tigre and Hararghe -- regions\nwhich suffered severely from drought -- were now able to sow\ntheir crops because of the favourable rains.\n    The government had distributed large quantities of seed and\nfertiliser, and the rains should ensure a good crop.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
