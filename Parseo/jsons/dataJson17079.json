        "TITLE": "SHELL CANADA <SHC.TO> SEES BETTER YEAR",
        "DATELINE": "    CALGARY, Alberta, April 24 - ",
        "BODY": "Shell Canada Ltd said\nperformance in all business segments in the first quarter\nshowed improvement over last year and it expects \"significantly\nenhanced performance\" in 1987.\n    Shell Canada reported first quarter earnings of 103 mln\ndlrs, or 90 cts per share, up from 40 mln dlrs, or 32 cts per\nshare.\n    Oil products earnings were 38 mln dlrs, up 19 mln dlrs from\nlast year, when margins were impaired by lower oil prices.\n    Shell Canada said chemical earnings were 17 mln dlrs in the\nquarter, compared with a loss of five mln dlrs in 1986. The\nstyrene business saw significant improvement, stemming from an\nincrease in international demand.\n    Resources earnings increased by six mln dlrs to 46 mln\ndlrs. Lower prices for all commodities were offset by the\nremoval of the Petroleum and Gas Revenue Tax, the impact of\nlower royalty rates and higher volumes.\n    Gross production of crude oil and natural gas liquids\nincreased seven pct from the first quarter of last year to\n11,200 cubic meters a day, Shell said.\n    Shell Canada also said natural gas sales volumes of 19.6\nmln cubic meters a day was up five pct from last year.\n    Sulphur sales of 4,143 tonnes a day were up 70 pct.\n    The company also recorded benefits of 10 mln dlrs from the\nacquisition of Shell Explorer Ltd. Interest expense for the\nquarter was lower than in the previous year, due to the early\nretirement of a 200 mln U.S. dlr debenture and the impact of a\nstronger Canadian dollar on U.S. dollar-denominated debt.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
