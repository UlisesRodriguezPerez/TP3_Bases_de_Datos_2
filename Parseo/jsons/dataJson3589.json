        "BODY": "Johnson and Johnson said the U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration has notified the company its food\nadditive petition for a high-intensity sweetener has been\nformally accepted and now will be reviewed by the agency.\n    The company said the product, with the generic name of\nsucralose, is made from sugar and tastes like sugar, but is\nabout 600 times sweeter.\n    It yields no calories and does not promote tooth decay.\n    Johnson and Johnson said the sweetner is being jointly\ndeveloped with Tate and Lyle PLC <TATL>.\n    Tate and Lyle is seeking approval in Canada, the United\nKingdom and other European countries, Johnson and Johnson said.\nThe company noted its petition covering the product and its\nsafety evaluation were submitted to the FDA last month.\n    While awaiting FDA approval, the company said, it is\nproceeding with plans for commercialization through its McNeil\nSpecialty Products Co subsidiary.\n    Johnson and Johnson said it is operating under a licensing\nagreement with Tate and Lyle, whose collaborative research with\nscientists at Queen Elizabeth College in London led to the\ndiscovery of Sucralose in 1976.\n    Patents and licensing agreements control the use of\nsucralose through the year 2001, Johnson and Johnson said.\n    Sucralose is a chlorinated derivative of ordinary sugar.\nThe carbon-chloride bonds in sucralose are stable and are not\nbroken during digestion or metabolism.\n    Sucralose is essentially not metabollized by the body. The\nchlorine content enhances sweetness without providing calories.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
