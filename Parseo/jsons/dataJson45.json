        "TITLE": "CHEMLAWN <CHEM> RISES ON HOPES FOR HIGHER BIDS",
        "AUTHOR": "    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - ",
        "BODY": "ChemLawn Corp <CHEM> could attract a\nhigher bid than the 27 dlrs per share offered by Waste\nManagement Inc <WNX>, Wall Street arbitrageurs said.\n    Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in\nover-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1\nmln shares changing hands by late afternoon.\n    \"This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs,\nmaybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing\nbidder,\" an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer,\nannounced before the opening today, expires March 25.\n    \"This is totally by surprise,\" said Debra Strohmaier, a\nChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly\nscheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management\nannouncement. She said a statement was expected but it was not\ncertain when it would be ready. \n    She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact\nbetween Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.\n    \"I think they will resist it,\" said Elliott Schlang,\nanalyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. \"Any company that\ndoesn't like a surprise attack would.\"\n    Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender\noffers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn\ncould try to find a white knight if does not want to be\nacquired by Waste Management.\n    Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said\nServiceMaster Companies L.P. <SVM> or Rollins Inc <ROL> were\nexamples of companies that could be interested.\n    ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S.\ncompany involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides and\nherbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of\nwastes.\n    Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to\nanother company that wants to capitalize on a strong\nresidential and commercial distribution system.\n    Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had\ncatapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but\nthe stock languished as the rate of growth slowed.\n    Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in the\nfourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for\nthe full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter.\n    Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of\nindividual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
