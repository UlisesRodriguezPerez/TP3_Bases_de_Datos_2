        "BODY": "Poland's winter wheat is likely to\nsurvive recent frosts but the impact of the cold will not be\nknown until late April, the Polish meteorology institute said.\n    Some varieties of winter wheat sown in Poland can survive\nground temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees C, Spokesman\nTeresa Tomaszewska told Reuters.\n    Even though an earlier thin protective layer of snow mainly\nmelted in February, air temperatures down to minus 30 C should\nnot be harmful, she said, but added that wheat can still be\ndamaged by cold spells in March and April, when young shoots\nmay be exposed to night frosts.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
