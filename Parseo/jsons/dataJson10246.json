        "TITLE": "FED DATA INDICATE POLICY LIKELY TO STAY ON HOLD",
        "AUTHOR": "    By Martin Cherrin, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, March 26 - ",
        "BODY": "Federal Reserve data released today\nindicate that there has been no policy change in recent weeks\nand that none is likely at next week's Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) meeting, economists said.\n    \"The Fed continues to be accommodative in its provision of\nreserves, indicating that there has been no policy shift since\nthe beginning of this year,\" said Harold Nathan, economist at\nWells Fargo Bank.\n    \"These numbers and other things suggest the FOMC will not\nchange policy,\" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co.\n    \"The Fed is sitting fairly pretty now. There's no real\nreason for it to change policy,\" said Joseph Liro of S.G.\nWarburg and Co Inc.\n    Liro said the economy is showing moderate growth and does\nnot require immediate policy easing and the money aggregates\nmay well end March at the bottom of their target ranges.\n    All of the economists agreed that the Fed's major concern\nnow is recent weakness in the dollar which early this week was\nheavily supported by central banks. They said fear of hurting\nthe dollar will cause the Fed to be cautious in lowering\ninterest rates further.\n    Numbers released by the Fed today were all in line with\nexpectations and similar to the data for most of this year.\n    The Fed said that banks' net free reserves averaged 603 mln\ndlrs in the two-week statement period that ended on Wednesday\nversus 749 mln dlrs in the previous period.\n    In the single week to Wednesday, banks' borrowings at the\ndiscount window, less extended credits, averaged 302 mln dlrs\ncompared with 228 mln dlrs in the first week of the statement\nperiod. Meanwhile the Federal funds rate average edged up to\n6.14 pct from 6.08 pct.\n    The Fed's failure to add reserves in the market on Tuesday\nand Wednesday surprised some, but economists said the data\nreleased today suggest it had no real need to add reserves.\n    The Fed's absence may be explained by the lack of any\npressing need for it to supply reserves and by a desire to\nboost borrowings in the second week of the statement period to\nmeet its borrowings target, said Liro of Warburg.\n    Liro said the Fed probably is shooting for a two-week\nborrowings average of 300-325 mln dlrs. The borrowings actually\naveraged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and that\nwas up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period.\n    Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming for\ntwo-week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mln\ndlrs. He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate of\naround 6.10 pct.\n    It is nearly impossible for the Fed to hit any borrowings\ntarget since the demand for excess reserves is erratic, said\nWells Fargo's Nathan. He said the Fed is focusing instead on\nthe funds rate and is trying to keep it roughly within a six to\n6-1/4 pct band.\n    Upward funds rate pressure and a big reserve-adding need\nare anticipated for the statement period that began today.\n More\n    Brusca believes the Fed will have to add 3.5 to four\nbillion dlrs a day in reserves in this statement period. Liro\nputs the add need at around 3.9 billion dlrs.\n    To partly address this requirement, many expect the Fed to\nadd permanent reserves with effect next Thursday by offering to\nbuy all maturities of Treasury bills on Wednesday. A similar\ncoupon \"pass\" may be required later.\n    There will be a greater demand for funds in this statement\nperiod because it includes the close of the quarter. Further\nupward pressure on the Federal funds rate may come from window\ndressing demand as the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
