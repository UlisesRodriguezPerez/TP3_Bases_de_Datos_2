        "BODY": "The U.K. Offshore oil industry has\nsuffered from last year's collapse in oil prices but should not\nsustain any permament damage, Minister of State for Energy\nAlick Buchanan-Smith said.\n    The drilling, diving and supply vessels sectors had been\nmost affected, Buchanan Snith told the House of Commons energy\ncommittee. He noted, however, that oil companies were still\nspending six mln stg a day to maintain North Sea production.\n    He added that a report by the manpower services committee\nwhich said 14,000 jobs were lost in the industry in 1986 should\nbe seen in the context of a total workforce of 300,000.\n    Prices of North Sea Brent-grade crude dipped to a low of\n8.50\ndlrs a barrel last July from a peak of over 30 dlrs the\nprevious November.\n    They recovered to around 18 dlrs a barrel after last\nDecember's OPEC meeting and Brent traded today around 17.15\ndlrs.\n    Buchanan-Smith said the U.K. Has no intention of adopting\nOPEC style quotas, noting that Britian is an oil-consuming as\nwell as an oil-producing nation.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
