        "TITLE": "U.S. GRAIN TRADE CALLS SHULTZ REMARK SIGNIFICANT",
        "AUTHOR": "    by Maggie McNeil, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 19 - ",
        "BODY": "A statement yesterday by Secretary\nof State George Shultz after he met with wheat growers that\nU.S. agricultural products must be competitively priced was\nsignificant in that he recognized the importance of the Soviet\nmarket and the need for U.S. prices to be at world market\nlevels, U.S. grain trade industry officials said.\n    They said that Shultz's comments, while not explicitly\nendorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR, were noteworthy\nbecause they were not negative towards such action.\n    In response to a query on what the State Department's\nposition is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow, Shultz told\nthe leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers that\nprices must be competitive if the U.S. is going to trade.\n    The Soviet Union, the world's largest grain importer, has\nbought no U.S. wheat for more than a year, complaining the\nprice was far above world market levels. A U.S. offer last fall\nto sell the Soviets lower-priced wheat through the export\nenhancement program, EEP, was also rebuffed due to the price.\n    Shultz was said to be adamantly against the U.S. wheat\noffer last year and has been reported to be one of the major\nobstacles in making another subsidy overture to the Soviet\nUnion, grain industry sources said.\n    Intense speculation the U.S. might make a fresh EEP wheat\noffer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in\nrecent trading sessions. Kansas City hard wheat futures rose\nanother 2-1/4 cents by midday at 2.88-1/4 dlrs per bushel,\nwhile CBT March wheat was up 1-1/2 cents at 2.92-1/2 dlrs.\n    \"I'm not sure this is an about-face, but it's clearly a\nrecognition that unless we're competitive, we won't sell to the\nSoviet Union,\" said a lobbyst for a major commodity group.\n    \"We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say that\nsomebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same\nthing at a lower price somewhere else,\" Shultz told the farm\nleaders. \"That is our approach in negotiations with the\nSoviets,\" he said.\n    If those comments do signal that the State Department is no\nlonger opposed to the U.S. selling wheat to the USSR under EEP,\nit certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to\nMoscow, an industry lobbyst said.\n    National Wheat Grower's officials were taking a cautious\nattitude towards the secretary's comments.\n    \"His comments were not discouraging, but they didn't in our\njudgment promise any immediate action on EEP,\" an official with\nthe wheat group said.\n    The Wheat Growers official noted, however, that \"there is\nsignificance in that fact that we haven't seen any significant\nnegative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets.\"\n    In a meeting with exporters this week, Secretary of\nAgriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request\nthat the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, the\nofficials said.\n    An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, who is\nreported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets,\nsaid that the Shultz comments \"are consistent with what he\n(Shultz) has taught for years as an economist,\" but said they\ndon't necessarily relate to the Soviet Union.\n    Amstutz could not be reached for comment, and an aide to\nLyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultz's statements.\n    But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may\nindicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow.\n    \"If he didn't say no, then there's a chance. This is\npotentially a positive development,\" a commodity source said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
