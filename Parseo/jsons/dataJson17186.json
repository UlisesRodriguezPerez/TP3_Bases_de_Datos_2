        "BODY": "Brazil's trade surplus in March\ntotalled only 136 mln dlrs compared to 1.13 billion dlrs in the\nsame month last year, director of the Banco do Brasil's Foreign\nTrade Department (Cacex) Roberto Fendt said.\n    In a news conference, Fendt attributed the weak performance\nin the March trade balance to labour strikes in the country.\nMarch exports totalled 1.43 billion dlrs, against 1.53 billion\ndlrs in February, and 2.16 billion dlrs in March 1986.\n    March imports amounted to 1.29 billion dlrs compared to\n1.27 billion dlrs in February and 1.02 billion dlrs in March\n1986.\n    Fendt said that coffee earnings rose to 220 mln dlrs in\nMarch from 110 mln dlrs in February while oil derivatives were\ndown to 54 mln dlrs from 58 mln dlrs in February.\n    He said that although the March results were considerably\nlower than the same month last year, the government's target of\nan eight billion dlr surplus for 1987 should be achieved. The\nJanuary-March trade surplus totalled 526 mln dlrs, well below a\nsimilar period last year, which reached 2.46 billion dlrs.\n    Asked to explain the reason for his optimism, Fendt said\nthey were estimating that in each of the last six months of the\nyear the trade surplus would amount one billion dlrs.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
