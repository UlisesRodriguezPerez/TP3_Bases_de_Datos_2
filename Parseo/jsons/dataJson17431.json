        "TITLE": "FTC FINDS 17 BILLION DLR COST IN OIL IMPORT FEE",
        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, April 29 - ",
        "BODY": "An oil import fee could cost\nconsumers nearly 17 billion dlrs a year and undermine long-term\nU.S. energy security by leading to a quicker depletion of \ndomestic reserves, a Federal Trade Commission study said.\n    The study by the FTC's bureau of economics found that a\nfive dlr a barrel tariff on crude oil and gasoline oil imports\nwould increase costs to consumers by 14 to 16.7 billion dlrs a\nyear.\n    After weighing the benefits of such a tariff against the\ncosts, the study found a five dlr a barrel import fee would\nhave a net cost to the economy of 3.6 billion dlrs a year.\n    Several oil import fee proposals ranging from two to 10\ndlrs a barrel have been made in Congress in an effort to cut\nthe federal budget deficit and maintain the momentum for energy\nconservation programs, which have been hurt by cheaper oil.\n    But by making foreign oil more expensive, the tariffs would\nreduce oil imports and force greater consumption of domestic\noil, which would deplete U.S. reserves faster, the study found.\n    \"Any attempt to increase our energy security by limiting\nimports will actually reduce our long-run energy security by\nspeeding the depletion of domestic reserves,\" the study said.\n    The five dlr a barrel tariff would also cut domestic\npetroleum refiners' profits by 7.5 to 10 billion dlrs a year,\nincrease domestic crude oil producers' profits by about 13\nbillion dlrs a year and raise government revenues by 6.7 to \n8.2 billion dlrs a year, the FTC said.\n    Under the Reagan administration, the FTC has consistently\nopposed government regulation of the oil industry at the state\nand federal levels.\n    \"This study backs up my belief that government regulation\nand interference with competition hurt both the market and\nconsumers,\" FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver said in a statement.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
