        "BODY": "Cominco Ltd has no\ncontract negotiations scheduled this week with any of the five\nstriking locals at the Trail smelter and Kimberley lead-zinc\nmine, union spokesmen said.\n    However, leaders of the negotiating teams are trying to set\nup an informal meeting to discuss the stalemate, said John\nOwens, spokesman for United Steelworkers of America local 480,\nwhich is one of three locals that represents 2,600 production\nand maintenance workers.\n    Owens also said Cominco has said the strike is costing it\nfive mln Canadian dlrs a day in debt service costs that are not\ncovered by revenue. He said the company has not estimated total\nlost revenue and Cominco spokesmen were not immediately\navailable for comment.\n    The strike, which began May nine, also involves two locals\nthat represent 600 office and technical workers.\n    The production and maintenance workers three weeks ago\nrejected a tentative three-year agreement that provided cost of\nliving adjustments but no basic wage increase.\n    Each of the five locals has a separate contract that\nexpired April 30, but the main issues are similar.\n    The Trail smelter produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and\n110,000 long tons of lead last year. The Sullivan mine at\nKimberley produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year, most for\nprocessing at the Trail smelter.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
