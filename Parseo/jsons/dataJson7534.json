        "BODY": "The Chinese port of Ningbo is\nworking well below capacity despite being only 130 miles from\nShanghai, which is seriously congested, a port official said.\n    Jiang Feng Xiang said the port -- the deepest in China --\nhandled 17.95 mln tonnes of cargo last year, up from 10.44 mln\nin 1985, but well below its potential capacity of 32 mln\ntonnes. Shanghai handled 100 mln tonnes of cargo in 1986.\n    Jiang said Ningbo is under-utilised because of its\ninadequate facilities, including a single track rail line\nlinking it to Hangzhou, where it joins the national network.\n    Ningbo handles crude oil exports and transhipments of coal\nfrom north to south China and imports include fertiliser and\nsoda ash and iron ore from Brazil and Australia. The docks can\nhandle ships of up to 150,000 tonnes and oil tankers of up to\n200,000 tonnes can load and unload in the harbour.\n    Most of Ningbo's port infrastructure has been built since\n1979, official publications show. A container berth and two\ntimber and three general cargo berths will be added during the\ncurrent 1986-90 five-year plan, Jiang said.\n    \"The rail line to Hangzhou will be double tracked by 1995.\nBy 2000, maybe, we will overtake Shanghai,\" he added.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
