        "BODY": "Varity Corp, earlier reporting a full\nyear loss against a prior year profit, said improvement is\nexpected in the balance of fiscal 1987 as new products fill the\ninventory pipeline, cutbacks in operating costs are realized\nand its newly acquired Dayton Walther business is fully\nintegrated.\n    However, operating results are likely to remain under\npressure in the first quarter ending April 30, it said.\n    Varity earlier reported a loss for fiscal 1986 ended\nJanuary 31 of 23.3 mln U.S. dlrs, compared to a year-earlier\nprofit of 3.9 mln dlrs.\n    Varity said continued deterioration in major markets, a\nweakening U.S. dollar and unforeseen delays in launching major\nnew lines of tractors contributed to the full year loss.\n    Industry demand for farm machinery continued to erode\nduring the latest fiscal year, with worldwide industry retail\nsales of tractors sliding more than 10 pct below last year's\ndepressed levels, the company said.\n    However, Varity increased its share of the global tractor\nmarket by more than one pct to 18.2 pct, it said.\n    The combined impact of costly sales incentives and foreign\nexchange adjustments on margins was substantial, Varity said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
