        "BODY": "Indonesia expects crude palm oil (CPO)\nprices to rise sharply to between 450 and 550 dlrs a tonne FOB\nsometime this year because of better European demand and a fall\nin Malaysian output, Hasrul Harahap, junior minister for tree\ncrops, told Indonesian reporters.\n    Prices of Malaysian and Sumatran CPO are now around 332\ndlrs a tonne CIF for delivery in Rotterdam, traders said.\n    Harahap said Indonesia would maintain its exports, despite\nmaking recent palm oil purchases from Malaysia, so that it\ncould possibly increase its international market share.\n    Indonesia, the world's second largest producer of palm oil\nafter Malaysia, has been forced to import palm oil to ensure\nsupplies during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan.\n    Harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporary\nshortage than to lose export markets.\n    Indonesian exports of CPO in calendar 1986 were 530,500\ntonnes, against 468,500 in 1985, according to central bank\nfigures.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
