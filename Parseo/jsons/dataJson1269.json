        "BODY": "The specialty retailing area continues\nto pay off for F.W. Woolworth Co, once known only as a five and\ndime store chain, which said its 1986 income rose 21 pct.\n    It was the fourth consecutive year of profit increases for\nthe New York-based retailer which was founded over 100 years\nago.\n    Woolworth's 1986 income rose to 214 mln dlrs or 3.25 dlrs\nper share compared with 1985's profit of 177 mln or 2.75 dlrs\nper share. Revenues for the year rose to 6.50 billion compared\nwith the prior year's 5.96 billion.\n    For the fourth quarter, the company reported profits rose\n10 pct to 117 mln dlrs or 1.78 dlrs per share compared with\n1985 fourth quarter results of 106 mln or 1.64 dlrs per share.\nRevenues rose to 2.02 billion from 1.85 billion dlrs.\n    Roy Garofalo, Woolworth vice president, told Reuters that\nincome generated by the company's specialty store operations\naccounted for 52 pct of the parent company's 1986 profits.\n    He said the company now has 4,700 specialty stores\noperating under 30 different names. Woolworth plans to open 650\nmore specialty stores in 1987. At this time last year, it\noperated 4,100 specialty stores, Garofalo said.\n    Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated by\nWoolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores, followed by the Richman\napparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop, a chain\nof discount children's apparel stores; The Rx Place, a discount\ndrug, health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies,\nwhich sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1,700\nWoolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, of\nwhich 1,200 are in the United States.\n    Harold Sells, chairman and chief executive of Woolworth,\nsaid in a statement, \"These results are especially gratifying as\nthey are an improvement over last year's record earnings.\"\n    Sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings in\neach quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlier\nperiod.\n    Woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the\n1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount store\nindustry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970's, Woolworth\nopened a discount general store chain, Woolco, and J. Brannam,\na discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the United\nStates, although Woolco still operates in Canada.\n    In 1985, however, Woolworth changed its strategy and\nannounced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time,\nthe company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores.\nSpecialty stores generally have higher sales per square foot\nthan general merchandise stores.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003"
