        "BODY": "The Bank of England said it forecast a\nshortage of around 250 mln stg in the money market today.\n    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing\nin official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain\nsome 505 mln stg, while bills for repurchase by the market will\nremove around 194 mln. In addition, a rise in note circulation\nand bankers' balances below target will each drain around 110\nmln stg.\n    Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions\nwill add some 690 mln stg to the system today.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
