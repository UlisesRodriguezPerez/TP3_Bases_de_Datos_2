        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 3 - ",
        "BODY": "The upcoming five-month deficiency\npayments to corn and sorghum farmers will be made half in cash\nand half in generic commodity certificates, a senior\nAgriculture Department official told Reuters.\n    Around 300 mln dlrs of the in-kind certificates, or\n\"certs,\" will be mailed out to farmers around March 15 or 16,\nTom von Garlem, Assistant Deputy Administrator for USDA's state\nand county operations, said.\n    The decision to make the payments in a 50/50 cash/certs\nratio was made Monday, but payments to producers will be\ndelayed until mid-month due to a problem with USDA's computer\nprogram, von Garlem said.\nget 11.5 cts per bushel in this next payment -- 5.75 cts in\ncerts and around 5.5 cts cash (5.75 cts minus Gramm-Rudman).\n    Farmers who did not receive advance deficiency payments at\nsignup will receive 63 cts per bushel. Slightly more than half\nof this payment will be in cash, von Garlem said, but he said\nthis will not markedly upset the 50/50 ratio, since most\nfarmers got advance payments.\n    \"The final certificate payments will be very close to 300\nmln dlrs,\" he said.\n    When asked if the Office of Management and Budget had\nresisted the cash/certs ratio, the USDA official said that \"we\nproposed 50/50 and OMB accepted it.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
