        "BODY": "Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita\nsaid in a statement the central bank will intervene in foreign\nexchange markets to stabilise exchange rates if necessary in\nclose cooperation with other major industrial nations.\n    Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including\nmarket intervention, if necessary, in line with the February 22\nParis agreement by six major industrial nations.\n    Canada, Britain, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany\nagreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around\ncurrent levels. Sumita's statement was issued after the dollar\nslipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148.40.\n    \"It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the\nsystem of floating rates,\" Sumita said.\n    The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean\nanything significant under the floating system, he said.\n    The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing\nthen were broadly consistent with underlying economic\nfundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage\ngrowth and adjustment prospects in their countries, the Paris\nstatement said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
