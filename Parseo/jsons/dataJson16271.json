        "DATELINE": "   WASHINGTON, April 13 - ",
        "BODY": "The U.S. Agriculture Department has\nlowered its ASCS terminal prices for low protein hard red\nwinter and hard red spring wheat at a number of locations, a\nsenior USDA official said.\n    USDA reduced the price of hard red winter wheat at Kansas\nCity and Texas by six cents, at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32\ncents and at St Louis by nine cents, Ralph Klopfenstein, deputy\nadministrator of commodity operations at the Agricultural\nStabilization and Conservation Service, said.\n    The department also lowered the terminal price of hard red\nspring wheat at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents, he said.\n    In addition, USDA cut the Pacific Northwest price of hard\nred spring wheat by 31 cents, USDA officials who asked not to\nbe identified said.\n    The officials said hard red spring wheat prices at Chicago,\nDenver and Toledo were adjusted by about the same amount as at\nPacific Northwest, Duluth and Minneapolis.\n    The price changes should lead to a pickup of PIK and roll\nactivity, Klopfenstein said. The price change was decided upon\nlast week and will be effective today, he said.\n    Klopfenstein also said the department raised the premiums\non high protein wheat to offset the drop in low protein wheat\nprices, meaning the net price on any wheat commanding a protein\npremium would remain unchanged.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
