        "DATELINE": "    MANILA, April 11 - ",
        "BODY": "A prolonged dry spell has damaged\n111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provinces\nin the central and southern Philippines, agriculture officials\nsaid.\n    They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produce\nestimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack of\nrainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailing\nconditions continued until next month.\n    Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped the\nlosses would be offset by the expected increase in output in\nother, normally more productive areas not affected by the dry\nspell.\n    Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice),\nrepresenting a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8\nmln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said.\n    About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at\n170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said.\n    Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has been\nhit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national total\nthus the damage is considered negligible.\n    In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled by\nproduction from non-traditional corn farms which diversified\ninto the cash crop from sugar two years ago.\n     The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut production\nin the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to\n320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued. There were no\nreports of actual damage.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
