        "BODY": "The Federal Reserve is expected to\ndirectly supply temporary reserves by arranging three or\nfour-day System repurchase agreements, economists said.\n    They said there is less chance that it will add reserves\nindirectly instead. If the Fed fails to supply reserves,\nhowever, economists said this will be a strong indication that\nit is firming policy, perhaps in preparation for a near term\ndiscount rate increase from 5-1/2 pct.\n    Federal funds, which averaged 6.29 pct on Friday, opened at\n6-7/16 pct and remained there in early trading.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
