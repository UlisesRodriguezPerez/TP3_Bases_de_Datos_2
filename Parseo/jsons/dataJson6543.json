However, some\ndealers reportedly backed out of the three-day System\nrepurchase agreements set on Monday, leaving the Fed with a\nsomewhat increased need to supply reserves.\n    Federal funds, which averaged 6.05 pct yesterday, opened at\n5-15/16 pct and remained there in early trading.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
