        "BODY": "A new steel quota system that would\nstrictly limit European Community (EC) support to the industry\ncould be forced on producers if they fail to find their own\nsolution quickly, officials said.\n    EC industry ministers meeting here considered two key\nproposals aimed at cutting back surplus capacity by 30 mln\ntonnes by 1990.\n    The first would limit the current quota system, which has\nprotected EC output for seven years, only to flat products and\nheavy sections, thereby forcing other types of steel products\ninto free market competition.\n    The second proposal would link continuation of a quota\nsystem with progress toward plant closures, although less than\na month ago the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer said they\nhad abandoned efforts to close plants voluntarily.\n    The ministers stopped short of imposing their own solution\nimmediately, instead urging steel producers to try again to\nreach agreement on voluntary cutbacks.\n    The EC Commission has said it will come up with detailed\nproposals in July on the future of the EC steel industry and EC\nindustry ministers meet again in September to reach a final\ndecision.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
