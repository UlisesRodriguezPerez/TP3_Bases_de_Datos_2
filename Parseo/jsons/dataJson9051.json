        "BODY": "Brazilian Science and Technology\nMinister Renato Archer said Brazil will keep its computer\nmarket closed to foreign goods in order to give its own infant\nindustry time to develop.\n    \"Every country establishes laws to protect its interests.\nThe United States closed their borders at a certain stage to\nsome foreign goods and therefore protected its industrial\ndevelopment. Now it is time for Brazil to do likewise,\" Archer\nsaid at the opening of a national software conference.\n    After several meetings, Brazil and the U.S. Have made no\nmajor progress in their computer row, which they have been\ntrying to resolve for the past 18 months.\n    The Reagan administration has objected to Brazil protecting\nits computer industry from imports.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
