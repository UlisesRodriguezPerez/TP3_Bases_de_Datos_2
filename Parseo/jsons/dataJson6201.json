        "TITLE": "U.K. OIL REVENUE FORECAST TO FALL IN 1987/88",
        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, March 17 - ",
        "BODY": "The U.K. Government forecasts that oil\nrevenues will fall to four billion stg in the fiscal year\n1987/88, from 4.75 billion in 1986/87 and 11.5 billion in\n1985/86.\n    The forecast came in the Treasury's Financial Statement and\nBudget Report issued after the Chancellor of the Exchequer\nNigel Lawson's annual budget statement to parliament.\n    The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15\ndlrs a barrel, in line with its earlier forecasts, and its oil\nrevenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remaining\nclose to current levels, the Treasury document said.\n    The Treasury said the 1987/88 oil revenue shortfall will\nreflect the oil price fall of 1986, as North Sea corporation\ntax is paid after a time lag.\n    The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel difference\nin oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mln\nstg for the current fiscal year, and 400 mln stg in a full\nyear.\n    Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987,\naccording to the statement. A change in one mln tonnes in\nproduction would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987/88\nand 50 mln stg in a full year, it added.\n    Total general government receipts for 1986/87 are now\nestimated to be 159.2 billion stg, 2.75 billion more than the\n1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts,\ndespite a shortfall of 1.25 billlion in oil receipts.\n    Additional non-North Sea corporation tax of 1.75 billion\nstg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of the\novershoot.\n    Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to\n168.8 billion stg in fiscal 1987/88, and among the main items,\nbesides diminishing oil revenues, were projected income tax of\n40 billion stg, up from 38.4 billion in the current year.\n    Non-North Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 13.5\nbillion stg in 1987/88, after the revised 11.2 billion in\n1986/87, and VAT revenue should amount to 23.3 billion,\ncompared with upwardly revised estimated 21.5 billion this\nfiscal year.\n    The general government expenditure for the coming fiscal\nyear is expected to total 173.5 billion stg, up from a revised\n164.9 billion in the current year.\n    A repayment of 800 mln on public corporations' market and\noverseas borrowings is forecast to bring the total Public\nSector Borrowing Requirement down to 3.9 billion stg in\n1987/88, from this year's revised 4.1 billion, the Treasury\nsaid.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
