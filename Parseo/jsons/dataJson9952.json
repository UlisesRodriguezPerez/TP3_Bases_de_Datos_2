        "DATELINE": "    CALGARY, Alberta, March 26 - ",
        "BODY": "<Norcen Energy Resources Ltd>,\n41 pct owned by <Hees International Corp>, said earnings and\ncash flow will improve in 1987, even if oil and gas prices\nremain at 1986 levels.\n    The improvement will result from production increases,\nlower taxes and royalties, reduced financing costs and from\noperating efficiencies and downsizing put into place during\n1986, the company said in the annual report.\n    Norcen previously reported 1986 earnings, excluding a 20.1\nmln dlr writeoff, declined by 58 pct to 50.0 mln dlrs from\n119.7 mln dlrs in in 1985.\n    Norcen's 1986 cash flow fell 10 pct to 204.9 mln dlrs from\n228.9 mln dlrs in the prior year.\n    It said the sharp decline in oil prices during 1986 was the\nmost significant factor for Norcen's reduced performance.\n    \"While financial results are far from the previous year's\nrecord levels, it is clear that Norcen has withstood declining\nprices and remains financially and operationally strong,\" Norcen\nsaid. It did not give a specific 1987 profit forecast.\n    The company said it is well positioned to capitalize on\nprofitable opportunities in its core business areas, and will\ncontinue to invest to increase revenue and asset values.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
