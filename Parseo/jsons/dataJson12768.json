        "BODY": "Grain handling at Rotterdam port's\nmain grain terminal was at a standstill today as members of the\nlargest Dutch transport union FNV staged a lightning strike for\nthe third day running.\n    Pieter van der Vorm, managing director of Graan Elevator\nMij (GEM), which handles 95 pct of grain passing through the\nport, said their main Europoort terminal was out of action\nbecause of a strike by technical staff.\n    The actions, in support of union demands in negotiations\nover a new labour agreement, began on Wednesday when grain\nhandlers stopped work.\n    Van der Vorm said that if strikes continued on today's\nscale for some time vessels coming to unload grain in Rotterdam\nwould face delays, but this was not happening yet.\n    Wednesday's actions left GEM's facilities 40 pct\noperational, and there were only limited strikes yesterday.\n    Talks between unions and employers yesterday and today\nproduced no result, but FNV spokesman Bert Duim said the union\nwas prepared to put their key demand, for a 36 hour working\nweek, at the bottom of the agenda.\n    Van der Vorm said, however, the union's demands on a range\nof issues were far in excess of the management's final offer.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
