        "BODY": "Taiwan said its foreign reserves suffered\nabout 3.4 billion U.S. Dlrs in exchange rate losses from July\n1986 to February 1987 as a result of the rise of the Taiwan\ndollar against the U.S. Currency.\n    Yu Chien-ming, head of the government statistics\ndepartment, told parliament yesterday he expected the losses to\nincrease as the Taiwan dollar continues to strengthen.\n    The Taiwan dollar, which opened at 34.24 to the U.S. Dollar\ntoday, has risen about 16 pct against the U.S. Unit since\nSeptember 1985. Some bankers expect it to rise to 33 by June\nand to 32 by the end of this year.\n    Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves now total 53 billion\ndlrs. At end-February they were 52.1 billion dlrs, the world's\nthird largest after West Germany and Japan.\n    Yu said the interest earned from the reserves totalled\nabout 1.68 billion U.S. Dlrs from July 1986 to February 1987.\nThe reserves are managed by the central bank and deposited at\nabout 170 leading banks in the U.S., Japan, Britain, Canada and\nSingapore.\n    About 75 pct of the reserves are in the form of cash,\nmostly in U.S. Dollars. The rest are in government treasury\nbills, certificates of deposit and bonds.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
