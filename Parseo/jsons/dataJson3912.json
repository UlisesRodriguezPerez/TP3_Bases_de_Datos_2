        "BODY": "Dart Group Corp <DARTA>, which wants\nto acquire Supermarkets General Corp for 1.62 billion dlrs, is\nnot likely to give up without a fight if its target seeks\nanother buyer, arbitrageurs said.\n    Speculation that Dart's offer of 41.75 dlrs per share could\nbe just the beginning of a bidding contest helped Supermarkets\nshares gain one to 42-1/8  on 2.3 mln shares.\n    One rumor had Federated Department Stores Inc <FDS> taking\na look at Supermarkets General. \"Our policy is that we do not\ncomment on any rumors or speculation of this nature,\" a\nFederated spokeswoman said.\n    An arbitrageur noted that Dart, controlled by chairman\nHerbert H. Haft and his son Robert, last year raised its\ninitial bid for Safeway Stores by approximately 10 pct when\nSafeway resisted.\n    However, that company was later sold to a buyout group that\ntopped the Hafts.\n    If history repeats itself, the Hafts could raise their bid\nto 46 dlrs if they are rebuffed by Supermarkets General, the\narbitrageur said. But another arbitrageur said the Hafts'\npresent bid seemed \"quite fair.\" He said the offer amounts to\n10 times after-tax-cash flow which is \"probably fully priced.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
