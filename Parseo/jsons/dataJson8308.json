        "BODY": "A number of individual zinc producing\ncompanies have approached the European Commission to sound out\nits reaction to a possible industry plan for a voluntary\nreduction of smelting capacity, Commission sources said.\n    The companies have been told that the Commission could not\njudge whether a plan would be acceptable under European\nCommunity, EC, competition rules until it had full details,\nthey said.\n    In 1983, the industry drew up a plan envisaging the loss of\nabout 130,000 tonnes of annual capacity, or about 10 pct of the\ntotal.\n    However, the industry did not proceed with this plan as\nzinc market conditions improved in 1984, the sources noted.\n    They said the companies which approached the Commission\nrecently -- and which they did not name -- appeared to envisage\na loss of productive capacity similar to that proposed in 1983.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
