        "BODY": "The yen could rise to 140 yen to the\ndollar, a leading Japanese businessman said.\n    Bumpei Otsuki, president of the influential Japan\nFederation of Employers' Associations, (Nikkeiren), told\nreporters: \"The yen might rise as far as 140 (to the dollar).\nThe U.S. Economy is not good, and as long as the U.S. Economy\nis not good, the U.S. Will put various pressures (on Japan).\"\n    \"The yen's level depends on the condition of the U.S.\nEconomy rather than Japan's economy, and as long as the\nAmerican situation is bad, the yen will continue to rise,\" he\nsaid.\n    To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen,\nJapanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means,\nincluding holding down wages as much as possible, Otsuki said.\n    He rejected recent calls from some government quarters for\nwage increases this year as a means of raising private\nconsumption and thus boosting domestic demand.\n    \"We have to keep wages as low as possible,\" he said.\n    He also said the yen's large and rapid rise is depressing\nthe outlook for the Japanese economy, noting that in addition\nto hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic market\nmanufacturers through cheap imports.\n    Parts of the service sector are also threatened, Otsuki\nsaid.\n    Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and a\ndownturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect service\nindustries, he said.\n    It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fully\nemploy those put out of work in the manufacturing sector, he\nsaid.\n    Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall in\nthe business year ending in March 1988, leading to a possible\nrecession in the Japanese economy, he said.\n    Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyond\nlevels experienced in 1986.\n    The government's Economic Planning Agency said last week\nthe economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986, the worst performance\nsince 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oil\nprice crisis.\n    In order to stimulate domestic demand and boost the\neconomy, tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of land\nand reforming the nation's housing stock are needed, along with\nsteps to bring down the high cost of commodities, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
