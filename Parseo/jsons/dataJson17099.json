        "DATELINE": "    HOUSTON, April 24 - ",
        "BODY": "Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc said its\nshareholders approved the merger of the bank with Chemical New\nYork Corp <CHL>, moving a step closer towards creating the\nnation's fourth largest bank.\n    The company said each holder will receive 31.19 dlrs a\nshare in cash and securities, somewhat less than the 35 dlrs to\n36 dlrs a share estimated when the deal was announced on\nDecember 15, 1986. The deal is now worth 1.16 billion dlrs.\n    The merger is still subject to approval by Chemical's\nshareholders, who will vote on the deal at the company's annual\nmeeting on April 28.\n    The company said 98.7 pct of the shareholders voting on the\nmerger cast an affirmative vote.\n    Chairman and chief executive officer Ben Love said all\nregulatory hurdles to the merger have been cleared, including\nlast week's final approval of the transaction by the U.S.\ncomptroller of the currency. Pending approval of Chemical's\nshareholders, the merger should be closed by May one, he added.\n    The bank said the combined company will have assets of\nabout 80 billion dlrs.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
