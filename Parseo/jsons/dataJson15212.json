        "BODY": "The relatively high level of real U.S.\ninterest rates suggests that there is scope for further\ndeclines in money market rates, but the Federal Reserve is\nunlikely to promote such a drop as long as the dollar remains\nvolatile, said J.P. Morgan and Co Inc chairman Lewis Preston.\n    He said in response to a reporter's question after the\nbank's annual meeting that money market rates could decline\nfurther but, \"I don't think the Fed is going to encourage that\nas long as the exchange markets are as volatile as they are.\"\n    On the other hand, he said that, barring a collapse of the\ndollar, he did not see rates going much higher.\n    He said that Morgan's recent rise in its prime lending rate\nwas \"purely a reflection of an increase in a whole spectrum of\nrates.\"\n    Preston reiterated earlier company forecasts that the U.S.\neconomy should show roughly 2.5 to three pct real growth this\nyear.\n    He also said that as a consequence of the dollar's decline\nand oil price rises, inflation would rise \"moderately\" to a 3.5\nto four pct rate in 1987.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
