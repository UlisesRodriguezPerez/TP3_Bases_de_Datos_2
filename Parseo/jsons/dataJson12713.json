        "BODY": "Changes by the USDA in its posted county\nprices have successfully increased PIK-and-roll activity as a\nway to pull corn out of government stockpiles, with the\nresulting jump in free supplies pressuring terminal corn basis\nvalues, cash grain dealers said.\n    Processors dropped spot Chicago corn basis bids three cents\nafter covering most of the April needs this week, with river\ncorn basis bids following CIF Gulf corn values lower.\n    The surge in PIK-and-roll also pressured corn futures, with\nMay settling today down three cents per bushel at 1.58-1/2\ndlrs, near the contract low of 1.49-1/4 dlrs. But unlike in the\npast when lower prices slowed country movement, now lower\ncounty prices widen the differentials with the corn loan and\nmake PIK-and-roll even more attractive, they noted.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
