        "BODY": "Indonesia has imported 12,000 tonnes of\nrefined sugar from Cuba to meet consumer demand in the province\nof South Sulawesi, the head of the provincial food agency said.\n    The imported sugar was needed because two of three sugar\nrefineries in the province have been temporarily shut down. It\narrived in the provincial capital of Ujungpandang today and\nwill be distributed to markets in the province, the food agency\nofficial said.\n    Indonesia used to be a sugar exporter but last year it\nimported 162,500 tonnes of sugar from Thailand, Angola and\nBrazil to bolster its depleted stocks.\n    Indonesia's sugar cane production last year was expected to\nrise significantly but domestic sugar consumption has soared\nbecause of rising demand by the food processing industry, the\nhead of the food logistics agency, Bustanil Arifin, has said.\n    The government has forecast that sugar production in\ncalendar 1987 would increase 30.2 pct to 2.59 mln tonnes from\n1.99 mln in 1986 but industry sources doubt whether the target\ncould be met due to persistent post-harvest handling and\ntransport problems.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
