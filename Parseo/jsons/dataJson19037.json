        "BODY": "Indonesia has increased its share in a\n434-billion-yen aluminium smelter joint venture with Japan from\n25 to 37 pct, Asahan Project Authority director A.R. Suhud\nsaid.\n    The Japanese Export-Import Bank said Indonesia had raised\nits share of (P.T. Indonesia Asahan Aluminium) company,\ncapitalised in 1975 at 91 billion, by swapping 32 billion yen\nin government loans to the company for an equity stake.\n    The Japanese shareholders, the Overseas Economic\nCooperation Fund and 12 companies, are to invest another 24\nbillion yen raising capitalisation to 147 billion yen.\n    Asahan reported total losses of 97.6 billion rupiah between\n1982 and 1985. Suhud said much of the company's 320 billion yen\ndebt had been caused by falling tin prices and the appreciation\nof the yen against the U.S. Dollar. Aluminium is sold in\ndollars.\n    Prices improved from 1,150 dlrs a tonne six months ago to\nabout 1,450 dlrs today. The plant is supposed to break even if\nprices stay at 1,500 dlrs a tonne.\n    Sahud said the plant, with a capacity of 220,000 tonnes a\nyear, would probably lose money again in 1987. The plant,\nsituated in North Sumatra, produces mostly for Japan.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
