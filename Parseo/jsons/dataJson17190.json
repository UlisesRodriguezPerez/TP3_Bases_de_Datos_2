        "DATELINE": "    QUITO, April 24 - ",
        "BODY": "The Ecuadorean economy, struck by an\nearthquake last month, will contract an estimated four pct in\n1987 and its crude oil output will drop by 42 pct, the\ngovernment's national development council (Conade) said.\n    A Conade report, dated April 21 and obtained, said that the\ncountry's gross domestic product (gdp) would fall by an\nestimated four pct compared to 1.5 pct growth last year. Conade\nfunctions as the country's main planning institution.\n    Crude output will fall to 61.2 mln barrels in 1987 from\n105.6 mln in 1986, Conade said. It forecast exports of 22.9 mln\nof crude and derivatives against 63.3 mln last year.\n    The March five earthquake killed up to 1,000 people and\ncaused an estimated one billion dlrs in damage. It paralyzed\nEcuador's crude output because it ruptured the country's main\npipeline from Lago Agrio, at the heart of jungle oilfields, to\nthe Pacific Ocean port of Balao.\n    It will take until at least end-July to repair the line and\nreturn output to normal levels, oil officials said. Ecuador\noutput was about 250,000 barrels per day before the tremor.\n    Conade forecast total 1987 exports of 1.77 billion dlrs,\n572 mln dlrs of which would be oil and derivatives.\n    Imports were forecast at 1.70 billion dlrs. Total 1986\nexports were 2.18 billion dlrs, of which 979 mln dlrs were\ncrude and derivatives, with total imports 1.66 billion dlrs.\n    Conade predicted that payments on Ecuador's 8.16 billion\ndlrs foreign debt will be limited to 947 mln dlrs this year\nagainst 1.489 billion dlrs last year. Conade's projected\nceiling on payments is not legally binding.\n    The current account balance of payments deficit was seen at\n934 mln dlrs in 1987. It was 696 mln dlrs in 1986.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
