        "BODY": "Pyongyang and a group of Tokyo-based\nNorth Korean businessmen plan to resurrect a North Korean\ngoldmine and boost annual output to almost one tonne within two\nyears from 600 pounds at present, said Li Sangsu, a spokesman\nfor <Unzan Mine Development Co>, the venture partner.\n    Work will begin on April 3 and the company aims to increase\noutput to 10 tonnes within a decade to pay off Pyongyang's 70\nbillion yen debt to 30 Japanese companies, Li added.\n    \"We expect this mine to be worth about 2,000 billion yen in\ngold deposits,\" he said.\n    The mine, started in 1896 by a U.S. Company, is one of six\nor seven virtually untapped mines in the Unzan area, 94 miles\nnorth of Pyongyang, Li said.\n    Li said modern equipment and advanced technology would\nincrease yields. \"Up to now, the mining was done with antiquated\nmethods and basic equipment.\"\n    The gold mine scheme is the latest in a series of moves by\nNorth Korea to clear its debts to Japanese creditors.\n    Earlier this year, Pyongyang tried and failed to pay off\npart of its debt with several tonnes of fish.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
