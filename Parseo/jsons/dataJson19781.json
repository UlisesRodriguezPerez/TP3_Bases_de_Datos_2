        "BODY": "The Paris-based Intergovernmental Council\nof Copper Exporting Countries (CIPEC) is closely studying the\ncurrent backwardation in world copper market prices but does\nnot envisage taking corrective action at present, CIPEC sources\nhere said.\n    The organisation's executive and marketing committees\nreviewed the current market situation during a series of\nmeetings here late last week, but took no major decisions.\n    The sources noted that the backwardation - premium of\nnearby supply over forward delivery - dates back several weeks\nand is the longest on record.\n   \"It's unusual,\" one official said, but added CIPEC did not\nhave any immediate recipe to remedy the situation.\n    The meetings featured a gathering of the 10 directors of\nCIPEC's regional copper development and promotion centres,\nwhich are based in Europe, Japan, India and Brazil.\n    Their main aim was to prepare the ground for the annual\nministerial meeting of CIPEC, which is scheduled for Zaire in\nlate September.\n    The last three ministerial meetings have been held in Paris\nto keep down costs.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
