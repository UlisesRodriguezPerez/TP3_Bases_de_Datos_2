        "BODY": "Network Control Corp said it\nintends to take a 250,000 dlr charge against earnings for the\nthird quarter ended March 31 and said sales for the quarter\nwould be about 400,000 dlrs, about 50 pct below sales in the\nsame year-ago quarter.\n    Network said it is taking the charge due to the significant\nincrease in accounts receivable which remain uncollected for\nmore than 90 days after billing. It said it ultimately will\ncollect most of those accounts.\n    It attributed the sales decline to a transition period for\nits new products and a delay in a major order.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
