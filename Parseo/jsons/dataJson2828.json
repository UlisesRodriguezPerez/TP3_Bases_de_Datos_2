        "BODY": "Strikes by Brazil's 40,000\nseamen and by petrol station owners in four states are causing\nmajor headaches to a government already wrestling with a debt\ncrisis.\n    A week ago seamen began their first national strike for 25\nyears and union leaders say they have seriously affected\nBrazilian exports by making idle 160 ships.\n    On February 20 the Brazilian government suspended interest\npayments on part of its huge foreign debt following a sharp\ndeterioration in its trade balance.\n    Today the government faced a fresh problem, when most\npetrol station owners in Sao Paulo, the country's industrial\nheartland, and in three other states closed down to press for\nhigher fuel prices.\n    There were fears that the combination of the two stoppages\ncould lead to a serious fuel shortage.\n    The seamen's leaders say their strike has halted 48 of the\n72 ships belonging to the state oil company Petrobras.\n    The Jornal do Brasil newspaper, in an editorial today\nentitled \"Dangerous Confrontation,\" said: \"From the economic\npoint of view the seamen's strike carries an alarming cost,\nwith grave consequences for the supply situation and for the\ncountry's external trade.\"\n    The seamen are seeking a 275 pct pay rise and have rejected\noffers of up to 100 pct.\n    Later today the Higher Labour Tribunal in Brasilia is due\nto rule on whether the seamen's strike is legal. But a senior\nofficial of the National Merchant Marine Union, Jorge Luis Leao\nFranco, told Reuters that the strike would continue regardless\nof the tribunal's ruling.\n    Labour unrest has worsened in Brazil following the collapse\nover the last few months of the government's Cruzado Plan price\nfreeze. Prices have been rising at about 15 pct a month. Not\nonly workers but also businessmen are restive. Petrol station\nowners said many garages had closed indefinitely today in Sao\nPaulo, Parana, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul.\n    Television reports said that in the Parana state capital of\nCuritiba petrol stations were only supplying fuel for\nexceptional cases such as ambulances and funeral processions.\n    Brazilian garage owners want to be allowed to raise their\nprofits on alcohol fuel and petrol sales to 1.26 cruzados (six\nU.S. Cents) a litre from 0.56 cruzados (about 2.5 cents).\n    Queues formed at petrol stations in Sao Paulo late last\nnight as motorists filled up their tanks while they still\ncould.\n    Political sources said the government of President Jose\nSarney was closely following the strikes and the overall fuel\nsupply situation.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
