        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, April 1 - ",
        "BODY": "The restoration of coffee export quotas\nbefore the end of the current 1986/87 coffee year (Oct 1/Sept\n30) now seems unlikely, given reluctance by International\nCoffee Organization, ICO, producers and consumers to resume\nnegotiations on an interim quota accord, producer delegates\ntold reporters.\n    Consumers and most producers see no point in reopening the\nquota dialogue while Brazil's position remains unchanged, they\nsaid.\n    Brazil's refusal to accept a reduction in its previous 30\npct share of the ICO's global export quota effectively\ntorpedoed talks here last month aimed at restoring quotas\nbefore October, the delegates noted.\n    Disappointment at the lack of progress on quotas forced\ncoffee futures in London and New York to new lows today,\ntraders here said. Near May in New York fell below one dlr in\nearly trading at around 99.10 cents per pound, traders said.\n    Producer delegates said that while the possibility of\nreimposing quotas before October remained on the ICO agenda, in\npractice the idea had effectively been discarded.\n    The ICO's executive board session here this week has so far\nbarely touched on the quota debate, demonstrating general\nunwillingness to revive talks while chances of success are\nstill remote, producer delegates said.\n    Some producers are in no hurry to see quotas restored,\ndespite the price collapse seen since the failure of last\nmonth's negotiations, they said.\n    \"With Brazil's frost season approaching, who wants to\nnegotiate quotas,\" one leading producer delegate said.\n    Coffee prices normally rise during Brazil's frost season\n(mainly June-August) as dealers and roasters build up stocks as\ninsurance against possible severe frost damage to Brazil's\ncrop.\n    Many producers are more interested in working towards\nreimposing quotas from October 1, based on a new system of\nquota allocations valid until the International Coffee\nAgreement expires in 1989, they said.\n    Guatemala has already proposed the \"other oilds\" producer\ngroup should meet in the next two months to begin talks on how\nto allocate quota shares.\n    Producers still seem divided on how to overhaul the quota\ndistribution system, with some producer delegates reporting\ngrowing support for a radical reallocation, based on the\nprinciple of \"objective criteria\" favoured by consumers.\n    At last month's council session a splinter group of small\nproducers backed consumer demands for new quota shares based on\nexportable production and stocks, while Brazil, Colombia and\nthe rest of the producers favoured leaving quota allocations\nunchanged, except for some temporary adjustments.\n    A delegate from one of the eight said more producers now\nsupported their cause.\n    The delegate said unless major producers like Brazil showed\nreadiness to negotiate new quota shares, prospects for a quota\naccord in October also looked bleak.\n    The U.S. and most other consumers are still determined to\nmake reimposition of quotas conditional on a redistribution of\nquota shares based on \"objective criteria.\"\n    ICO observers remained sceptical that Brazil would be\nprepared to accept a quota reduction when the ICO council meets\nin September.\n    Brazil has adopted a tough stance with banks on external\ndebt negotiations and is likely to be just as tough on coffee,\nthey said.\n    They said Brazil's reluctance to open coffee export\nregistrations might reflect fears this would provoke another\nprice slide and force an emergency ICO council session, which\nwould most likely end in failure.\n    Producers met this afternoon to review the market situation\nbut had only a general discussion about how further\nnegotiations should proceed, a producer delegate said.\n    Producers plan to hold consultations on quotas, and then\nmay set a date for a formal producer meeting, but plans are not\nfixed, he said.\n    The ICO executive board reconvened at 1650 hours local time\nto hear a report from consultants on ICO operations. The board\nmeeting looks set to end today, a day earlier than scheduled,\ndelegates said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
