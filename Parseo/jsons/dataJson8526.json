        "BODY": "Cooper Development Co said it\nrevised results for the year ended October 31 to a loss of 61.7\nmln dlrs, or 2.33 dlrs per share, down from the\npreviously-reported loss of 12.1 mln dlrs, or 46 cts per share.\n    The restatement was made because of change in the method of\naccounting for a combination of several company-controlled\nconcerns that resulted in a 53.5 mln dlr charge, Cooper\nDevelopment said.\n    Last August Cooper Development combined its Cooper\nBiomedical Inc unit and its Cooper Laboratories subsidiary with\nTechnicon Instruments Corp, a company acquired from Revlon Inc\n<REV>, a Cooper spokesman said.\n    The spokesman said the transaction was accounted for as an\nacquisition, but the Securities and Exchange Commission took\nissue with the accounting method and said it should be\naccounted for as a reorganization of entities under common\ncontrol.\n    This treatment requires that the costs associated with the\ntransaction be expanded rather than capitalized as an\nintangible asset, the company said.\n    It also said that, since the charged required an expensing\nof previously accrued liabilities, the company will experience\nno resulting material change it its cash flow.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
