        "BODY": "Despite earlier optimistic\nindications, the South African corn crop is at a critical stage\nin its development and recent reports of heat stress could\nreduce production and therefore exportable supplies, the U.S.\nAgriculture Department said.\n    In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the\ndepartment said South Africa's corn exports in the 1986/87\n(Oct-Sept) season are estimated at 2.5 mln tonnes, up 40 pct\nfrom the previous year.\n    The re-emergence of South Africa as a competitor follows a\nperiod of severe droughts, which at one point required South\nAfrica to import 2.7 mln tones of U.S. corn in 1983/84, it\nsaid.\n    Since those imports in 1983/84, the U.S. has been facing\nincreased competition from South Africa in Taiwan and Japan.\n    But if South Africa is perceived as lacking available\nsupplies, purchases of U.S. corn may be further stimulated, the\ndepartment said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
