        "BODY": "The 1992 deadline for abolishing economic\nbarriers within the European Community should help French\neconomic growth and create jobs, president of the French\nemployers' federation CNPF Francois Perigot said.\n    \"Having a market at our disposal which is as homogeneous and\naccessible as that of Europe is an incredible piece of luck,\" he\ntold Le Figaro in an interview.\n    He said that the majority of French business leaders were\nenthusiastic about the abolition of barriers and saw it as an\nopportunity rather than a danger for their companies.\n    \"It can permit us to return to a growth rate which is much\nbetter than we could achieve in isolation. We know that we have\nto reestablish growth at three pct a year to solve the enormous\nproblems confronting us -- and I am referring mainly to\nunemployment,\" Perigot added.\n    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said yesterday that\nFrench growth would be just two pct this year, the same as last\nyear and compared with the government's original 2.8 pct\ntarget.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
