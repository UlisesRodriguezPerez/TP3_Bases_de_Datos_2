        "BODY": "Dwindling global crude oil reserves and\nthe lack of any major new discoveries in recent years will send\nthe world into an energy crisis by 1990, the former Atlantic\nRichfield Co chairman Robert O. Anderson said.\n    \"It's going to come sooner than anyone thinks,\" Anderson\ntold reporters after addressing a Houston business lunch. \"I\nbelieve we're going to see a change in the world oil markets in\ntwo to three years because oil is becoming harder to find.\"\n    Anderson, who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oil\nand Gas Co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mln\nbarrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about\n4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear.\n    \"If you looked around the world, you could not scrape up\none mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the Middle\nEast,\" he said. \"We're soon going to be right back where we\nwere in 1973 and 1979.\"\n    Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 at\nabout 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb.\n    \"There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn't\nenough supply,\" he said. \"There have been no major oil\ndiscoveries for the past 15 to 20 years.\"\n    Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil reserves, the last major world\ndiscovery, has already produced about five billion barrels of\noil or more than half of its estimated reserves, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
