        "BODY": "Australian trade unions said they have\nlaunched week-long strikes and other industrial action in New\nSouth Wales (NSW) to protest against new laws that would reduce\ninjury compensation payments.\n    Union sources said talks with the state government broke\ndown last night, but the two sides are scheduled to meet later\ntoday in an attempt to find a compromise.\n    Rail freight and shipping cargo movements in the country's\nmost populous state were the first to be affected, and union\nofficials said almost every business sector will be hit unless\nthere is a quick settlement.\n    The state government recently introduced a new workers'\ncompensation act which would cut the cash benefits to injured\nworkers by up to a third. The act is now awaiting parliamentary\nratification.\n    NSW state premier Barrie Unsworth has said workers'\ncompensation has risen steeply in recent years and the proposed\ncuts would save hundreds of mlns of dollars a year.\n    Union officials said industrial action could spread to\nother states as the federal government also plans to make sharp\ncuts in workers' compensation.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
