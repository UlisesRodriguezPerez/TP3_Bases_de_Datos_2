        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 3 - ",
        "BODY": "House Ways and Means Committee\nChairman Dan Rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back\nthe tax increase if it did not have President Reagan's support.\n    He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be a\nnumber of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan sought\na tax increase to help balance the budget.\n    However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates\nenacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged.\n    There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the\n1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year.\n    Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his\n1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general tax\nincreases.\n    On trade issues, Rostenkowski said he did not expect the\nmajor trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industry\nfor special protection.\n    \"To go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide,\"\nhe said.\n    This apparently ruled out congressional approval of another\ntextile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports, as was\nproposed again this year.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
