        "BODY": "Top-level talks last week between the\nEuropean Community (EC) and the United States failed to resolve\na dispute over pasta which may provoke new trade frictions next\nmonth, diplomatic sources said.\n    The U.S. Insists the EC complies with what it regards as an\nunambiguous ruling from the world trade body GATT and\ndismantles an export subsidy system which has led to Italy\ntaking an increasing share of the U.S. Pasta market.\n    The sources said the EC, which currently provides subsidies\nof around 16 cents a pound, offered a compromise in last week's\ntalks in Brussels but that this was rejected by the U.S.\n    U.S. Assistant Special Trade Representative Jim Murphy has\nreturned to Washington ahead of a theoretical July 1 deadline\nfor agreement, set last August when the two sides resolved a\nrelated dispute over EC restrictions on U.S. Citrus imports.\n    The diplomatic sources said the citrus issue could be\nreopened if the pasta dispute was not solved quickly. It was\nalso possible the U.S. Would reimpose a 40 pct tariff on EC\npasta, lifted when the citrus row was settled.\n    But the two sides may agree to extend the deadline for a\nfew days as EC Commissioners Willy de Clercq and Frans\nAndriessen are due to visit Washington from July 7 to 10.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
