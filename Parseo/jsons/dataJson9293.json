        "DATELINE": "    JEDDAH, March 25 - ",
        "BODY": "British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher\ndenied in an interview published in Saudi Arabia today that her\ngovernment's oil policy contributed to weakness in world oil\nprices.\n    She said the government was determined not to intervene to\ninfluence production decisions by oil companies operating in\nthe North Sea.\n    \"We believe these must be a matter for the commercial\njudgment of the oil companies,\" she told the Arabic language\ndaily al-Sharq al-Awsat in an interview coinciding with a visit\nto London by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.\n    Thatcher said this policy had not contributed to the fall\nin oil prices as North Sea production was now about the same as\nin 1984 when prices were close to 30 dlrs a barrel.\n    British production was on a plateau and was unlikely to\nincrease in the future, she said.\n    \"We naturally share the concern of Saudi Arabia and other\nOPEC members about the harmful effects of oil market volatility\nfor both producer and consumer countries,\" Thatcher said.\n    \"On our part, we are careful to avoid any actions which\nmight add to such volatility.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003"
