        "TITLE": "SHULTZ USSR TRIP FUELS TALK OF EEP WHEAT OFFER",

        "BODY": "Speculation the United States will\noffer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have\nreached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary of\nState George Shultz' visit later this month to Moscow.\n    Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat\nmarkets since officials from the two countries held their\ncustomary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow's\ndecision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn market\nstrengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.\n    Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13.\n    Shultz' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in\nthe way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement\nProgram, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit to\nMoscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representatives\nhere as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was\npreparing an offer.\n    Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S.\nAgriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lipped\nabout the prospects of a subsidy offer.\n    But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the\ncontention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer,\nwhile not a \"done deal,\" is a live possibility.\n    Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whom\nasked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that an\noffer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent.\n    Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible,\nare saying they would not rule one out.\n    Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., yesterday went so far as to\npredict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days\nto two weeks.\n    Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders\nwho had been in contact with administration officials.\n    Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U.S.\nWheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancement\noffer would be made by the middle of this month.\n    Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end\nup being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this\nyear when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs\nper tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat.\n    Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheat\nsubsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of\nU.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans.\n    As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal\nwould appear to be price.\n    Last summer the administration took the controversial step\nof offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but were\nembarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds\nthat the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat prices\nfar above world market prices.\n    The administration's decision to set the subsidy level up\nfront instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a\nmeans of controlling the price while attempting to dampen\ncriticism, grain trade sources said.\n    Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz\nfrom saying the Soviets were \"chortling\" because Washington was\noffering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to\nU.S. housewives.\n    The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives\nhere is that a general warming of relations between the two\ncountries since last summer, combined with continued hard times\nin the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer.\n    In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would consider\nbuying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively.\n    However, observers have not forgotten the circumstances\nsurrounding the administration's announcement of the wheat\nsubsidy offer last summer.\n    Up until the time of the announcment, congressional and\nindustry leaders were led to believe the White House had\ndecided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not\nonly the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries.\n    Instead, the administration scaled back the offer to\ninclude only the Soviets.\n    That last-minute change of heart adds a measure of\nuncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced\nthat the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to\nsell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
