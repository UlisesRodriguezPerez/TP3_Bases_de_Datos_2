        "BODY": "Algerian and Spanish producers which\ntogether meet 40 pct of the Western market's needs in\nquicksilver have agreed to apply a minimum selling price of 300\ndlrs per unit, the Algerian news agency APS said.\n    The agreement was made during a meeting here last week\nbetween Algeria's Entreprise Nationale des Non-ferreux et\nSubstances Utiles (ENOF) and Spain's Almaden to discuss the\nmarket situation.\n    The two firms \"took note with regret that prices quoted by\nsome specialised publications do not reflect the reality of the\nwhole market since they take into account only part of the\ndeals made,\" a statement by ENOF said.\n    The result is that the prices quoted are far away from two\nfirms' production costs.\n    \"They have thus decided that their selling price would not\nbe linked any more to the prices quoted by these publications\nand that sales would be made at a minimum price of 300 dlrs fob\nper jar, which is close to their production cost,\" the statement\nsaid.\n    It added that Turkish producers would join in when the two\nfirms meet again in Madrid later this month.\n    The price of quicksilver on the London Metal Exchange\nhovered around 200 dlrs this week.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
