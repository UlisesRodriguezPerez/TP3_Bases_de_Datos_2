        "BODY": "The European Community authorised the\nexport of 25,000 tonnes of barley yesterday, bringing the\ncumulative total at weekly tenders since the series started\nlast June to 3.33 mln tonnes, close to the 3.37 mln under\nlicence in the same year ago period, traders said.\n    All bids for wheat were rejected. However, the total to\ndate of 5.06 mln tonnes is still substantially more than the\n3.03 mln under licence a year ago. The 80,000 tonnes of French\nmaize granted for export moved the total to 135,000 tonnes\nsince the tender opened in February this year. There were no\nfacilities for maize in the previous weekly grain export\nseries.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
