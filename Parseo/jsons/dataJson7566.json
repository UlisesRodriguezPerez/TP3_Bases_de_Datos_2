        "TITLE": "TROPICAL FOREST DEATH COULD SPARK NEW DEBT CRISIS",
        "AUTHOR": "    By Eric Hall, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    TOKYO, March 20 - ",
        "BODY": "The death of the world's tropical rain\nforests could trigger a new debt crisis and social and\nbiological disasters, scientists and ecologists involved with\nthe International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) said.\n    At stake is the ability of developing nations, including\nBrazil, Mexico and the Philippines, to service their debts and\nthe loss of trade worth hundreds of billions of dollars in\nimportant sectors such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals, they\nsaid.\n    The experts, gathering ahead of an ITTO meeting of\nconsumers and producers near Tokyo next week, said the problem\nis already acute.\n    The Philippines offers a textbook case of the economic\ndangers. \"For many third world nations, the loss of the forest\nis not just a loss of resources,\" said Delfin Ganapin, a\nPhilippine government consultant on environmental impact.\n    \"In the 1960s we had 16 mln hectares of commercial forest,\nnow we have one mln. We have only around 10 years of profitable\nlogging left. With a 26 billion dlr debt, the loss of logging\nforeign exchange earnings is serious,\" he said.\n    About 14 mln Philippine people depend on upland areas that\nare now denuded and farmers cannot grow crops.\n    Government security advisers say that as a direct result,\nthe most likely source of revolution in the Philippines is in\nthe upland areas, said Ganapin.\n    Replanting is uneconomic and replanted tropical hardwoods\nhave less than a 50 pct chance of survival. There is no known\nway to reproduce the wood, or the millions of species within.\n    \"No replanting programme has been successful,\" said Almy\nHafild from the Indonesian Network for Forest Conservation.\n    Ganapin said three billion dlrs would be needed in the next\ntwo years alone to save five mln hectares of critically denuded\nland in the Philippines.\n    The experts say that without a major initiative from the\ndevelopment banks, the vicious circle will continue with\ncountries cutting more forest to help service short-term debts\nat the cost of long-term insolvency.\n    Yet timber, a five billion dlr a year industry, is not\nnecessarily the most direct economic product of the forests,\nand nations must be educated in how best to \"farm\" them, said\nPeter Kramer, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) conservation director.\n    There is a four billion dlr annual global trade in the end\nproducts of rattan, and Brazil nuts earn Brazil 16 mln dlrs a\nyear, he said.\n    U.S. Pharmacologist Norman Farnsworth has calculated that\n25 pct of all U.S. Prescriptions owe their active ingredients\nto higher plants growing in the forests.\n    Deforestation would wipe out the chance of further\ndiscoveries and force major corporations to research, develop\nand produce man-made substitutes, at a cost which scientists\nsay is incalculable.\n    By the year 2000, only 10 developing nations will still be\nexporting timber, from 33 currently, and their export earnings\nwill drop from a 1980 peak of 6.8 billion dlrs to less than two\nbillion, a World Bank and U.N. Sponsored survey said.\n    Of the 20.3 billion dlrs advanced by the World Bank,\nInter-American, African and Asian Development Banks in 1980-84,\nonly 100 mln dlrs went to forestry projects, it said.\n    WWF statistics show half of the world's tropical forests\nhave vanished since the 1940s. Of 2,000 mln hectares remaining,\nup to 16 mln are destroyed each year by destructive logging\npractises and by local farmers.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
