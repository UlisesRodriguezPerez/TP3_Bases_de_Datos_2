        "BODY": "An 11-day-old strike by\nBrazilian seamen is affecting coffee shipments and could lead\nto a short term supply squeeze abroad, exporters said.\n    They could not quantify how much coffee has been delayed\nbut said at least 40 pct of coffee exports are carried by\nBrazilian ships and movement of foreign vessels has also been\ndisrupted by port congestion caused by the strike.\n    A series of labor disputes and bad weather has meant\nBrazil's coffee exports have been running at an average two\nweeks behind schedule since the start of the year, one source\nadded.\n    By the end of February shipments had fallen 800,000 bags\nbehind registrations, leaving around 2.4 mln bags to be shipped\nduring March. By March 10 only 230,000 bags had been shipped,\nthe sources said.\n    Given Brazil's port loading capacity of around 100,000 bags\na day, even if normal operations were resumed immediately and\nnot interrupted by bad weather, some March registered coffee\nwill inevitably be shipped during April, they added.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003"
