        "BODY": "The Federal Reserve is expected to\nenter the U.S. Government securities market to add temporary\nreserves, economists said.\n    They expect it to supply the reserves indirectly by\narranging a fairly large round, two billion dlrs or more, of\ncustomer repurchase agreements. The Fed may add the reserves\ndirectly instead via System repurchases.\n    Federal funds, which averaged 6.02 pct on Friday, opened at\n6-1/8 pct and traded between there and 6-1/16 pct. Funds are\nunder upward pressure from settlement of recently sold two-year\nnotes and from a Treasury tax and loan call on banks.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
