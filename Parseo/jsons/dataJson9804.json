        "BODY": "First Interstate Bancorp Chairman\nJoseph Pinola said the bank holding company would lose about 16\nmln dlrs per year, after taxes, if it had to put its medium and\nlong-term debt on non-accrual status.\n    In an interview, he said that could result in about a 4.5\npct decline in annual earnings per share.\n    Pinola said First Interstate, like other banks, has not yet\ndecided to put the loans, which Brazil stopped paying interest\non last month, on non-accrual status.\n    \"None of us really wants to injure negotiations that might\nbe going on,\" he said.\n    First Interstate reported to the Securities and Exchange\nCommission last week that it has about 339 mln dlrs in\nmedium-to long-term loans to Brazil.\n    It said on December 31, 1986 its nonperformind Brazilian\noutstanding debt totaled about 4.1 mln dlrs.\n    First Interstate also has about 168 mln dlrs in short-term\nloans or trade lines to Brazil.\n    Pinola said he believes the solution to the Brazilian debt\ncrisis will be more political than economic, which he said he\nfinds, \"very disquieting and discomforting.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
