        "BODY": "West Germany's current account\nsurplus widened to a provisional 8.8 billion marks in March\nfrom a slightly downwards revised 6.5 billion in February, a\nspokesman for the Federal Statistics Office said.\n    The trade surplus fell to a provisional 10.1 billion marks\nfrom 10.4 billion in February.\n    The Statistics Office had earlier put the February current\naccount surplus at a provisional 6.6 billion marks. The\nprovisional February trade surplus was confirmed.\n    The Office said the March trade surplus had also risen\nstrongly from the year-ago month total of 8.5 billion marks,\nwhile the March current account surplus compared with only 4.3\nbillion marks a year earlier.\n    The figures given by the office show nominal trade flows,\nbut an office statement said that the current account surplus\nhad also risen in real terms from February.\n    However, it attributed this partly to the fact that\npayments to the European Community had been brought forward in\nFebruary, with the result that transfers abroad in March were\nunusually low.\n    The Statistics Office said March imports totalled 36.93\nbillion marks, a rise of 15 pct from February and of 4.7 pct\ncompared with March 1986.\n    March exports of 47.06 billion marks were 11 pct higher\nthan in February and 7.6 pct higher than in March last year.\n    Other data reported in the current account balance showed\nthere was a 400 mln mark deficit in supplementary trade items,\na 500 mln mark deficit in the services account and a 400 mln\nmark deficit in transfer payments.\n    The Statistics Office said that in the first three months\nof this year the trade surplus had risen to 27.8 billion marks\nfrom 22.6 billion marks in the same period last year.\n    The current account surplus had risen to 20.0 billion marks\nfrom 15.6 billion.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
