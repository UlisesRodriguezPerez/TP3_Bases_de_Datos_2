        "BODY": "Italy's Foreign Trade Minister Mario\nSarcinelli, commenting on speculation in the Italian press,\nsaid a sharp balance of payments deficit in May could not be\nattributed to recent moves liberalizing the purchase of foreign\nsecurities.\n    Sarcinelli was reacting to suggestions that last month's\noverall 3,211 billion lire deficit, which compares with April's\n2,040 billion surplus, could be linked to a May 13 decree\nabolishing obligatory non-interest-bearing deposits on foreign\nsecurities purchases.\n   \"The deficit can be better attributed to premature and\ndelayed foreign trade payments and receipts (leads and lags)\nrather than capital outflow to portfolio investment,\" Sarcinelli\nsaid in a statement.\n    Earlier today the newspaper La Repubblica cited remarks by\nthe Bank of Italy, which announced the deficit for May and said\nit had been partly caused by \"non-banking capital outflows.\"\n    \"In practice, it seems that there has been a constant flow\nof capital to foreign securities or investments outside our\nborders,\" said the newspaper.\n    But the newspaper added that it was still not possible to\nsay how far the move to abolish foreign securities purchase\ndeposits had affected Italy's balance of payments.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
