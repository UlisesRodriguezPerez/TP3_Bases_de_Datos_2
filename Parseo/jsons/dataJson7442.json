He cited\nthe default of 15 container leasees and ship charterers,\ncosting the company approximately 25 mln dlrs.\n    He also cited a 23 mln dlr cost as a result of a closing\ntwo of its subsidiary's ferry services, and a 10.3 mln dlr\nprovision to cover losses on the sale of container assets and\nseverance pay costs.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
