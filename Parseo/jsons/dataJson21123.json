        "BODY": "Recent announcements from Moscow of\nnext year's grain production targets indicate that the Soviets\nare estimating this year's grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes,\nAgriculture Department analysts said.\n    USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, but\nsome earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987\ngrain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes.\n    Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday,\nputting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst of\nSoviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article in\nIzvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be\n\"25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year.\"\n    \"This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213\nmln tonne (grain) crop,\" the analyst said.\n   \n    In calculating Moscow's crop estimate, USDA used the 235\nmln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figure\npublished in a Soviet economic journal this month.\n    USDA's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a\nrange of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said.\n    Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvest\nprogress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said.\n    While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agriculture\nofficial Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be\nas good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest.\n    A member of Nikonov's party commented that although 230 mln\ntonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems would\nbring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
