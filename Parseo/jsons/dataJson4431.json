Cobriza\nproduced the equivalent of around 40,600 fine tonnes of copper\nlast year.\n    Maoist guerrillas using dynamite interrupted train traffic\ntwo days ago when they blew up railway tracks and derailed a\ntrain laden with minerals 225 km (135 miles) east of Lima at\nChacapalca, between the coast and Cobriza.\n    An official at Minero Peru Comercial, Minpeco, Peru's state\nminerals marketing firm, confirmed there had been no\ndeclaration of force majeure on the shipments from Cobriza.\n    Officials at National Train Company, Enafer, headquarters\nin Lima, the Peruvian capital, declined to comment on when\ntrain traffic would be restored to Cobriza.\n    But an Enafer official, reached by telephone in the central\nAndean city of Huancayo, near Chacapalca, said traffic could be\nrestored by Saturday.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
