        "BODY": "Japanese microchip makers are being\nstrong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact on\nsemiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's\nmarket to foreign chips, industry analysts said.\n    But doubts remain over whether the Ministry of\nInternational Trade and Industry (MITI), which is pressuring\nthe firms, can successfully battle market forces and whether\nthe U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of any\nbreathing space, they said.\n    U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last September\nhave pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanese\nchipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said.\n    \"MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry\nto get things done,\" said Bache Securities (Japan) associate\nvice president Peter Wolffe.\n    Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for the\nJanuary to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensive\nchips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subject\nto the pact's price controls.\n    The ministry also asked electronics firms to provide\ndistributors with certificates designating them as authorised\nexporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which grey\nmarketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said.\n    U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in\njeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American markets\nand little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan.\n    But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to the\nproduction cuts, several analysts said. Last week, NEC Corp\nsaid it would cut production in line with MITI's request.\n    \"NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI's\ndemands,\" said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. \"Once\nNEC cuts production, it means they all have.\"\n    Still, pressures remain to keep production high. Japanese\nfirms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales that\nthe Commerce Department assigns them under the pact.\n    \"The best way to lower cost is to produce more,\" said Salomon\nBrothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec.\n    Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also\nspur higher production next quarter, Merrill Lynch analyst Matt\nAizawa said.\n    Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new\nrestrictions, some industry officials said.\n    \"It's like tax avoidance schemes,\" said Steve Donovan, head\nof MMI Japan K.K. \"As soon as you close one route, another\nopens.\"\n    MITI's pressure has annoyed some makers, who had earlier\nshrugged off MITI guidance.\n    \"It's getting to be like communism,\" said one.\n    But analysts said output cuts could help by making it\neasier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcing\nfirms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss.\n    \"They're going to have to start running their businesses\nlike businesses,\" Bache's Wolffe said.\n    MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaign\nurging chip users to buy foreign-made chips, but U.S. Industry\nofficials said response has been mixed at best.\n    \"There has been some change, but it's not across the board,\"\nsaid one U.S. Spokesman. \"The companies have a varying degree of\nurgency.\"\n    The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on the\ntroubled U.S. Industry remains in doubt, analysts added.\n    Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM (dynamic\nrandom access memory) chips could merely speed the transition\nto one megabit chips, where Japan now leads, analysts said.\n    Whether U.S. Firms are able to stage a comeback in memory\nchips, or interested in doing so, also remains unclear, they\nsaid.\n    Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new U.S.\nConsortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing the\nmost advanced technology for microchip manufacturing.\n    Even in the thorny area of access, much depends on U.S.\nCommitment as well as on Japanese openness, some said.\n    \"The SIA (U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association) doesn't\neven have an office here,\" a source close to the industry said.\n\"You could question just how committed they are.\"\n    In addition, some industry analysts question the\neffectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out third\ncountry chipmakers such as those in South Korea.\n    \"(South) Korea's gaining market share,\" said one analyst.\n\"They're the real winners from the agreement.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003"
