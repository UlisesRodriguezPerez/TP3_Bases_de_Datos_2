        "BODY": "Sumner Redstone, president of National\nAmusements, Inc, predicted he can win regulatory approvals to\nwrap up the 3.4 billion dlr acquisition of Viacom International\nInc in 60 to 90 days.\n    Redstone, 63, catapulted himself into the big leagues of\nentertainment early today when a group of Viacom managers and\ntheir financial backers decided not to top National's bid.\n    \"We've had counsel working for some time in every region\nwhere Viacom has cable televison systems\" Redstone told Reuters\nin a telephone interview.\n    Redstone also said \"Viacom is committed to working very\nclosely with us to obtain approvals.\" Viacom has been seeking\napprovals for transfer of its broadcast licenses and cable\nsystems since September when its management group first\nadvanced a buyout plan.\n    But Redstone turned the situation into a spirited bidding\ncontest which was capped by the announcement this morning that\nViacom's independent directors on behalf of Viacom entered into\na defintive merger agreement with National.\n    National is a family business which operates a chain of\nmovie theaters. It is dwarfed by Viacom.\n    Redstone said he was weary after talks dragged on through\nthe night but also excited at the prospect of running a leading\nelectronic media company. He noted that the number of motion\npicture admissions in the U.S. has shown no growth in 15 years.\n    Of nine satellite television channels operated by Viacom,\nfour are motion-picture oriented pay channels. Redstone said\nexclusive contracts with pay television networks are the\nemerging trend. \"Up until recently you could see any motion\npicture on any pay channel,\" Redstone said.\n    He noted Viacom has exclusive agreements with two studios\nand plans to sign a deal with a third company next month.\n    Redstone said the management group's investment bankers\nwill be paid what is due for termination of its merger\nagreement. Such fees could total about 30 mln dlrs. \"That will\nbe a company expense,\" Redstone said.\n    He said BankAmerica <BAC> Corp has had numerous inquiries\nfrom lenders who want to participate in a 2.25 billion dlr\nfinancing for the deal. BankAmerica will provide 592 mln dlrs.\n    After the merger, Viacom will be a subsidiary of National\nbut 17 pct of the company will be in public hands.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
