        "BODY": "U.S. Exports of edible\ngroundnuts could fall to 185,000 tonnes in the year to\nSeptember 1987 from 248,000 in the same 1986 period, trading\ncompany Tracomin SA said.\n    It revised its December 1986 forecast that exports would\ntotal 205,000 tonnes, citing low demand, the loss of U.S.\nMarket share in the two main importing countries, Britain and\nthe Netherlands, and the sale of nuts intended for export at a\npremium in the U.S. Domestic market.\n    Tracomin estimated export availability from the 1986 crop\nat 215,000 tonnes compared with 264,000 the previous year.\n    Tracomin said it expects a good 1987 U.S. Groundnut crop\nand forecast a resurgence in U.S. Exports next year.\n    \"Barring any market manipulations, a good U.S. Harvest in\n1987 could lead to attractive prices, active trading and the\nreappearance of the U.S.A as the world's leading producer of\npeanuts,\" it said.\n    Overall exports from China, the leading exporter last year,\nwill remain at exceptionally high levels this year despite\nquality complaints and difficulties in implementing some\nearlier high-priced contracts. It is too early to say if China\ncan retain its current market share in 1988, Tracomin said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
