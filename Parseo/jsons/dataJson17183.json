        "BODY": "The U.S. Agriculture Department has\nnarrowed by three cents the price differential between the\nLouisiana Gulf price of corn and posted country prices pegged\nto the gulf price, USDA officials said.\n    The change, effective April 27, means posted county prices\nwill be three cents higher in the region, Robert Sindt,\nassistant deputy administrator of USDA's Agricultural\nStabilization and Conservation Service, said.\n    Trade sources said USDA adjusted the differentials because\ngulf prices had shown some weakness in recent days compared\nwith the rest of the country.\n    Sindt said Louisiana Gulf corn price differentials that had\nbeen between four and eight cents would, effective Monday,\nrange between one and five cents.\n    Trade sources said cash bids at the Louisiana Gulf have\nbeen between three and 4.5 cents weaker than in the rest of the\ncountry in recent days, and that USDA's move would strengthen\nthe front end of the corn market.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
