        "DATELINE": "    FRANKFURT, March 24 - ",
        "BODY": "The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.5\nbillion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities\nrepurchase pact at a rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank spokesman\nsaid.\n    Banks, which bid for a total 8.6 billion marks liquidity,\nwill be credited with the funds allocated tomorrow and must buy\nback securities pledged on April 22.\n    The allocation was in line with market expectations the\nBundesbank would provide more than the 3.4 billion marks\ndraining from this week as an earlier facility expires.\n    Call money fell to 3.60/70 pct ahead of the allocation from\n3.75/85 pct yesterday, dealers said.\n    The excess allocation compensates for public funds leaving\nthe system which the Bundesbank added last week via\ngovernment-owned banks.\n    However major tax payments by banks on behalf of customers\ndrew to a close this week, lessening the need for liquidity.\n    The call money declines surprised some dealers, who\nspeculated it was because the Bundesbank disbursed further\ngovernment funds today. However, most said this had not\noccurred.\n    Banks were well stocked with liquidity, having 47.1 billion\nmarks in minimum reserves at the Bundesbank on Friday, up from\n49.9 billion on Thursday. Average daily reserves over the first\n20 days of the month fell to 52.6 billion from 53.1 billion.\nFor all of March, banks would be required to hold net daily\naverage reserves of 50.7 billion marks, dealers said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
