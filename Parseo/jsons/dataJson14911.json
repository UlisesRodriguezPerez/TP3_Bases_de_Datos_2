        "DATELINE": "    HONG KONG, April 8 - ",
        "BODY": "Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd\n<JARD.HK> said it will withdraw the previously announced\nfour-for-one bonus issue of \"B\" shares and replace it by a\ntwo-for-five bonus issue of ordinary shares.\n    A statement said the firm expects to pay total dividends\nfor 1987 of not less than 40 cents a share on the expanded\ncapital.\n    Jardine Matheson decided to withdraw its issue because of a\njoint announcement earlier today by Ronald Li, chairman of the\nStock Exchange of Hong Kong, and Securities Commissioner Ray\nAstin, that the listings of new \"B\" shares would be barred.\n    The official announcement said this will include the\nproposal by Jardine Matheson.\n    But the Jardine statement quoted chairman Simon Keswick as\nsaying: \"We continue to believe that the issuing of \"B\" shares\nwould benefit shareholders, and regret that they will not be\ngiven the opportunity to vote on the matter at this stage.\"\n    Keswick said the \"B\" share issue will benefit Jardine\nMatheson's shareholders by giving the firm flexibility to issue\nordinary shares for expansion in future without diluting\nexisting shareholders' voting rights.\n    However, he added: \"We certainly welcome (the Secretary for\nMonetary Affairs) David Nendick's referral of this very\nimportant matter to the Standing Committee on Company Law\nReform and are hopeful that the process will lead to the\ndevelopment of general principles which can be embraced by all\nconstituents of the Hong Kong market.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003"
