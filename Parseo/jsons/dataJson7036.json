        "BODY": "Brisk increases in personal income and\nconsumption are to appear in February data released today, but\nthe bond market's recent sluggishness suggests there will be no\nmajor price reaction unless the rises are much larger than\nexpected, economists said.\n    Personal income is forecast to rise by 0.6 to 0.8 pct,\ncompared with no change in January, while consumption\nexpenditures are projected to increase 1.4 to 1.6 pct,\nreversing most of the two pct drop recorded in January.\n    M-1 money supply data for the March 9 week will also be\nreleased. An increase of some 2.3 billion dlrs is expected.    \n    Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc\nexpects a one pct rise in income, led by a strong gain in wage\nand salary disbursements in February.\n    Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 337,000 jobs in February, the\naverage workweek lengthened by 0.6 pct and hourly wages rose by\nfour cts, he noted in a report. Vigorous spending on durable\ngoods last month, especially cars, foreshadow a rise of at\nleast 1.5 pct in consumption, he added.\n    The prospect of bearish data did not trouble the bond\nmarket much yesterday, with the 30-year Treasury bond slipping\njust 7/32 to 99-28/32 for a yield of 7.51 pct.\n    Analysts said the market is still trapped in a narrow\nrange, desperately seeking direction.\n    \"Seasonally adjusted, it's already December in the bond\nmarket,\" quipped Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co\nInternational Inc.\n    Paul Boltz of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc said the\nsteadiness of long bond yields around 7.5 pct, despite some\nsigns of a stronger economy, probably reflects expectations\nthat inflation will remain subdued.\n    But he warned that this assumption might not be justified.\n    \"It took the bond market a long while to see that inflation\nwas not returning to double digits, and now that it has learned\nthat lesson, it may be a little slow to see that a four to five\npct inflation is a real possibility ahead,\" Boltz said in a\nreport.\n    After trading late yesterday at 5-15/16 pct, Fed funds were\nindicated by brokers to open comfortably at 5-15/16, six pct.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
