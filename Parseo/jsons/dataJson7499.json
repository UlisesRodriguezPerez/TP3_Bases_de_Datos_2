        "TITLE": "FED DATA SUGGEST U.S. CREDIT POLICY IS ON HOLD",
        "AUTHOR": "    by Jeremy Solomons, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, March 19 - ",
        "BODY": "Latest Federal Reserve data suggest\nthat the U.S. banking system is flush with reserves going into\na period of traditional tightness and that overall monetary\npolicy is on hold, economists said.\n    \"There is ample liquidity.... The Fed is not going to shift\ngears at the present time or for at least another month,\" said\nMaria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.\n    \"Technical and seasonal considerations aside, there is\nnothing for the (credit) market to get excited about,\" added\nRobert di Clemente of Salomon Brothers Inc.\n    Adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount window\naveraged only 228 mln dlrs a day in the first week of the bank\nstatement period ending next Wednesday, compared with 233 mln\nand 451 mln in the first weeks of the previous two periods.\n    Another sign of abundant liquidity was the upward revision\nin banks' net free reserves in the two-week period to March 11\nto a daily average of 759 mln dlrs from an estimated 660 mln.\n    Finally, a Fed spokesman told a press briefing that the 14\nmoney center banks were absent from the Fed's discount window\nfor the third week running, with the latest week's borrowing\nsplit between the large regional and the smaller banks.\n    While modest open market intervention was apparently enough\nto defuse any funding pressures in the first week of the latest\nstatement period, economists predicted that the Fed would have\nto be more aggressive in coming weeks.\n    The Fed injected temporary reserves directly and indirectly\non four of the five trading days via system and customer\nrepurchase agreements.\n    \"Fed funds will be coming under relatively intense\npressure,\" said Salomon's di Clemente, noting the approaching\nmonth- and quarter-end and the round of holidays and tax dates\nin April.\n    \"The Fed is faced with a large seasonal adding\nrequirement,\" said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc,\nwho expects a permanent bill purchase next week and a coupon\npurchase in early April.\n    Economists were also heartened by further signs of a\ndeceleration in money supply growth, not only in the largely\ndiscredited M-1 gauge but also in the more closely watched M-2\nand M-3 aggregates.\n    M-1 grew a mere 500 mln dlrs in the week to March nine,\ncompared with private forecasts of a 2.3 mln dlr rise. Weekly\nM-2 and M-3 components also hinted at slower overall growth.\n    \"The M-1 increase was surprisingly modest and I suspect we\nare on our way to another moderate set of M-2 and M-3 figures\nfor March,\" said Salomon's di Clemente. Merrill's McCarthy said\nthey could even come in below the bottom of their respective\ntarget ranges.\n    In February, M-2 was 18.2 billion dlrs below its upper\nlimit and M-3 was 20.8 billion beneath.\n    Noting Fed Vice Chairman Johnson's encouraging remarks on\ninflation today and recent interest rate cuts overseas, some\neconomists suggested this slowing in monetary growth could lend\nsupport to calls for further accommodation here.\n    \"Our belief is that we could still get a move downwards in\nrates before anything else,\" said Salomon's di Clemente, adding\nthat the key swing factor will continue to be the strength of\nthe U.S. economy.\n    Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank agreed that the economy's\nhealth would remain the main influence on policy but, contrary\nto di Clemente, he said that recent signs of faster growth and\ninflation could lead to higher rates first.\n    Drexel's Ramirez did not commit herself either way, adding\nthat the next major move may have to wait until April 14 when\nFebruary's U.S. trade data are due for release.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
