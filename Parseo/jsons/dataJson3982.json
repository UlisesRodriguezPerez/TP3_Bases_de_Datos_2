        "BODY": "Today's debt rescheduling talks\nbetween the Philippines government and its bank advisory\ncommittee were postponed until Thursday to give the banks more\ntime to consider Manila's novel proposal for paying part of its\ninterest bill in notes instead of cash, bankers said.\n    The committee banks met briefly earlier today and decided\nthat they needed more time in particular to consider a news\nreport which quoted a Reagan Administration official as urging\nthat the proposal be given serious consideration.\n    \"The banks felt that this was new information and that\nfurther consultation was called for,\" one banker said.    \n    In a despatch yesterday from Washington, Reuters quoted the\nofficial as saying Manila's plan to pay some interest with\nnotes that could be converted into equity investments in the\nPhilippines was fully consistent with the Reagan Administration\nstrategy for handling developing country debt.\n    \"The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quite\nunique and I don't think it's something that should be\ncategorically rejected out of hand,\" the official said.\n    Because of the key role the U.S. plays in the debt crisis,\nforeign banks in particular wanted time to analyze the\nsignificance of the policymaker's comments, bankers said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
