        "BODY": "U.S. farmers who in the past have\ngrown oats for their own use but failed to certify to the\ngovernment that they had done so probably will be allowed to\ncontinue planting that crop and be eligible for corn program\nbenefits, an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said.\n    Currently a farmer, to be eligible for corn program\nbenefits, must restrict his plantings of other program crops to\nthe acreage base for that crop.\n    Several members of Congress from Iowa have complained that\nfarmers who inadvertantly failed to certify that they had grown\noats for their own use in the past now are being asked to halt\noats production or lose corn program benefits.\n    USDA likely will allow historic oats farmers to plant oats\nbut not extend the exemption to all farmers, Lyng's aide said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
