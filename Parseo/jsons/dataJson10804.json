        "TITLE": "JAPAN SET TO RIDE OUT YEN RISE, OFFICIALS SAY",
        "AUTHOR": "    By Rich Miller, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    TOKYO, March 30 - ",
        "BODY": "The government is determined to ride out\nthe latest sharp rise of the yen without taking panic measures\nbecause it expects the currency's appreciation to prove\ntemporary, senior officials said.\n    \"The market has already located a ceiling (for the yen) and\nmarket forces are pushing the dollar back up a bit,\" one senior\nFinance Ministry official said.\n    He attributed the dollar's fall in recent days to special\nfactors, in particular, selling by Japanese investors ahead of\nthe March 31 end to their fiscal year.\n    That selling largely came to an end this morning after\nabout one hour of trading here, the senior official said. \"They\n(the investors) became more or less quiet after 10 o'clock\n(0100 GMT),\" he said.\n    After falling to a record low of 144.70 yen this morning,\nthe dollar edged back up in late trading to end at 146.20.\nDealers attributed the late rise to remarks by Prime Minister\nYasuhiro Nakasone that major nations had agreed to stabilise\nthe dollar above 150 yen.\n    Several officials said they did not see any fundamental\nreason for the dollar's recent sharp fall.\n    One official even called the market's recent actions\nirrational. If anything, the U.S. Decision to slap tariffs on\nJapanese electronics goods should support the dollar against\nthe yen because it will cut Japanese exports to the U.S., He\nsaid.\n    As a result, several officials said they saw no reason to\nalter the broad thrust of government policy agreed to at last\nmonth's meeting of major nations in Paris.\n    \"We don't see any substantial reason to change our policy\nstance,\" one senior official said.\n\u0003"
