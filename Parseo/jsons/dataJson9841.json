        "DATELINE": "    MADRID, March 26 - ",
        "BODY": "The Bank of Spain provided 1,145 billion\npesetas in assistance funds which bankers said reflected fears\nof fresh increases in overnight rates.\n    The daily auction was the biggest of the year and comes\nafter the previous record set last June 6 of 1,240 billion\npesetas.\n    A spokesman for one of Spain top five banks said higher\novernight call money rates were expected in the short term in\nview of disappointing money supply figures for February.\n    The M-4 money supply, measured as liquid assets in public\nhands, rose 16.7 pct last month against 8.1 pct in January and\ncompared with this year's eight pct target. Money supply growth\nwas 11.4 pct last year.\n    The central bank on Tuesday raised overnight rates by a\nquarter of a percentage point to 14 pct on demand for 746\nbillion pesetas. Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of the\nyear and have been increased to drain liquidity on rising\ndemand for funds. \"The policy is proving counter-productive and\nrates will have to come down in the long-term,\" the bank\nspokesman said in reply to Reuters enquiries.\n    He said higher rates were fuelling an influx of short-term\nspeculative capital from abroad.\n    \"At least 800 mln dlrs of current excess liquidity in the\nsystem is convertible pesetas from West Germany and other\ncountries with much lower rates,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
