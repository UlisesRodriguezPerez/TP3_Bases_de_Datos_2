        "DATELINE": "    MONTREAL, April 7 - ",
        "BODY": "(Consolidated-Bathurst Inc) said it\nexpects improvement in the pulp and paper sector shown in the\nsecond half of 1986 to continue this year. The continued\nimprovement would be due to good market demand, better product\nprices and high operating capacity, the company said in its\nannual report.\n    Consolidated-Bathurst, which reported operating profit of\n104 mln dlrs last year on sales of 2.02 billion dlrs, said its\njoint-venture acquisition of a market pulp mill at Castlegar,\nB.C. last year broadens its product range and will contribute\nto equity earnings.\n    Last year's results were up from 1985 operating profit of\n80 mln dlrs and sales of 1.73 billion dlrs.\n    The company said it views its near-term prospects with\nimproved optimism.\n    It said results from its Bridgewater newsprint mill in the\nU.K. should improve greatly this year due to stronger capacity\nand production and more favorable market conditions.\n    It said it anticipates a return to profitability in 1987\nfor its Diamond-Bathurst Inc (DBH) subsidiary, which lost 6.2\nmln U.S. dlrs and underwent a reorganization last year, and\nexpects higher sales and earnings for its other North American\npackaging divisions.\n    Consolidated-Bathurst said the outlook for its Europa\nCarton unit is mixed. It said the effect of trade disputes\nbetween the United States and the European Economic Community\non the West German economy and the higher value of the mark may\nlead to increased costs which could not be offset by price\nincreases.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
