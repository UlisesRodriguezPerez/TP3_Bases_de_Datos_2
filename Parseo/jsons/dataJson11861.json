        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, April 1 - ",
        "BODY": "The prospect that other banks will\nfollow industry leaders Citibank and Chase Manhattan in raising\ntheir prime rate is likely to cast a pall over the credit\nmarkets today, economists said.\n    Bond prices had been making a smart recovery from two days\nof heavy selling when Citibank surprised the market by\nannouncing a quarter-point increase in its prime rate to 7-3/4\npct. Chase Manhattan quickly followed.\n    Prices quickly fell by a full point, even though the dollar\n- the market's overriding concern of late - rose sharply on the\nnews.\n    Citibank cited the higher cost of money, especially in the\nEuromarket, as the reason for raising its prime rate.\n    Part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fears\nof a tighter Federal Reserve policy to defend the dollar, but\neconomists said it is too early to tell whether the Fed, whose\npolicy-making federal open market committee, FOMC, meets this\nweek, is already tightening its grip on credit.\n    \"The Fed seems to have been a bit slow in meeting the\nbanking system's reserve needs this statement period, but I\nwouldn't conclude anything until I've seen the Fed data,\" said\nJeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank.\n REUTER^M\n\u0003"
