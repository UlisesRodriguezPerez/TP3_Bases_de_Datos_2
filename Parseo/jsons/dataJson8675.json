        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 24 - ",
        "BODY": "The U.S. Has offered warships to\nescort Kuwaiti tankers in the Gulf past Iranian anti-ship\nmissile batteries, Defence Department officials said.\n    The officials told Reuters yesterday the offer was made\nlast week by Navy Admiral William Crowe, chairman of the\nPentagon Joint Chiefs of Staff, during a Middle East visit.\n    Reagan administration officials said later that Washington\ndid not seek military confrontation with Tehran, but would not\nlet Iran use Chinese-made \"Silkworm\" anti-ship missiles, capable\nof covering the narrow entrance to the Gulf, to choke oil\nshipments to the West.\n    Defence officials said Kuwait had asked if protection for\nup to a dozen vessels, most of them tankers, could be provided\nby three U.S. Navy destroyers and two frigates now in the\nsouthern Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.\n    In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy's small\nMideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz, the Pentagon has\nmoved 18 warships, including the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk,\ninto the northern Arabian Sea in the past month.\n    White House and defence officials said that massing the\nfleet was routine and had nothing to do with the Iran-Iraq war\nor Iran's stationing of missiles near the mouth of the Gulf.\n    The State Department said on Friday that Iran has been told\nabout U.S. Concern over the threat to oil shipments in the\nGulf. The communication was sent through Switzerland, which\nrepresents U.S. Interests in Iran.\n    Iran denied as baseless reports that it intended to\nthreaten shipping in the Gulf and said any U.S. Interference in\nthe region would meet a strong response, Tehran Radio said on\nSunday.\n    Several hundred vessels have been confirmed hit in the Gulf\nby Iran and Iraq since early 1984 in the so-called tanker war,\nan offshoot of their 6-1/2-year-old ground conflict.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
