        "BODY": "International Business Machines Corp\nhas started the year aggressively, but industry analysts said\nthe company still faces some tough rounds in its fight to stop\na two-year earnings slump.\n    \"I am more impressed with what's happening at IBM than I\nhave been in a long time,\" said PaineWebber analyst Stephen\nSmith.\n    \"But they're not out of the woods yet,\" he added.\n    At 1.30 dlrs a share, IBM's first-quarter net income easily\ntopped most estimates on Wall Street, which had ranged from an\neven dollar to 1.20 dlrs.\n    Most analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by IBM's\nperformance. But they indicated that IBM's chances for a full\nrecovery hinged on several key factors whose impact will not be\nfelt until later in the year.\n    These include the success of IBM's new personal computer\nline, introduced two weeks ago, and its 9370 minicomputers,\nwhich will begin volume shipments in July.\n    In addition, IBM has said the full benefits of its\nearly-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves will\nemerge as the year progresses.\n    Analysts noted that IBM chairman John F. Akers was\nrelatively more upbeat in assessing the company's outlook than\nhe has been for nearly a year.\n    \"Although the worldwide economic situation remains\nunsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,\"\nAkers said, pointing to, among other things, higher\nfirst-quarter shipments. \"We remain optimistic about the\nprospects for both the industry and IBM,\" he said.\n    \"Akers was most encouraging,\" said PaineWebber's Smith.\n    A weak dollar, a lower tax rate and strong mainframe\ncomputer sales all contributed to the better-than-expected\nfirst-quarter results, analysts said.\n    \"Shipments of the 3090 mainframes were very strong in\nMarch,\" after a weak January and February, said Ulric Weil of\nWashington-based Weil and Associates.\n    Sales of the top-of-the-line mainframes, commonly called\nthe Sierras, \"bailed out the whole quarter,\" Weil said, adding,\n\"If this continues, it augers well for the rest of the year.\"\nREUTER...^M\n\u0003"
