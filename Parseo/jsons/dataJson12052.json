        "BODY": "The U.S. Has been promised a near\nmonopoly of maize exports to Spain from third countries\nguaranteed under an agreement with the European Community, an\nEC official said.\n    The official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters that\nthe guarantee was given in an unpublished clause of the\nagreement.\n    Under the accord, which began in January, third countries\nwere guaranteed access for the next four years for two mln\ntonnes a year of maize to the Spanish market, as well as\n300,000 tonnes of sorghum.\n    However, the official said the U.S. Had been assured that\nalmost all the exports would be reserved for its traders.\n    The EC Commission is to ask member states to agree either a\ntender system to fix reduced import levies for the maize or to\nauthorise direct imports by the Spanish intervention board.\n    EC sources noted that under a tender system maize from\noutside the U.S. Would sometimes be offered on more favourable\nterms than that from the U.S.\n    No Commission spokesman was immediately available for\ncomment.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
