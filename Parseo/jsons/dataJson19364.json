        "BODY": "Investor Irwin Jacobs said he has an\ninvestment in Gillette Co amounting to less than five pct of\nthe consumer products company's stock.\n    Jacobs, who made his comment in response to an enquiry, did\nnot comment further.\n    Yesterday, Gillette rebuffed a takeover proposal from\nRevlon Inc. Under an agreement between the two companies,\nRevlon must have the permission of Gillette's board before\nmaking an offer to shareholders. The board declined to grant\nthat permission.\n   \n    Gillette has been the topic of takeover speculation for\nseveral weeks. Its stock has traded heavily, and arbitragers\nsaid they believe Jacobs may not be the only investor who has a\nsizeable position in the company.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
