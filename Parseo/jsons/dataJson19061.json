        "BODY": "Japan could avoid a sharp rise in the\nvalue of the yen against the dollar if Japan, the U.S. And\nother nations succeeded in restructuring their economies, an\nadvisory panel to the government's Economic Planning Agency\n(EPA) said.\n    The advisory body said in its report that the yen would\nsoar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a global\nbasis were delayed.\n    An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall to\nslightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the U.S. Failed to\nrestructure their economies.\n    The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cut\nJapan's current account surplus to two pct of gross national\nproduct (GNP) in 1993, the report said. It said such a change\nwould slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annually\nduring the seven-year period to 1993.\n    If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollar\nwould remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan's\ncurrent-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993. This\nscenario put Japan's GNP growth at 3.5 pct a year.\n    It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economy\nand four pct for Japan by 2,000 if the adjustments were made.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
