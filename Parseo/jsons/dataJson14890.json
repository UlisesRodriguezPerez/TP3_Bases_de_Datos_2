        "TITLE": "ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTRALIAN MARKETS BOOMING",
        "AUTHOR": "    By Peter Bale, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "    SYDNEY, April 8 - ",
        "BODY": "Australian markets are booming as foreign\nfund managers redirect capital away from the United States and\nother traditional markets, analysts said.\n    High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and\nan increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of\nfresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese and\nU.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said.\n    Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in\nand have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as they\ndiversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said.\n    A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in\nthe past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the\ncurrency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow.\n    Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital\nare not available, but brokers said they received almost daily\ninquiries from Japan and the United States.\n    \"These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about\nand they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is ending\nup here with the attraction of high interest rates and\nreasonable currency stability,\" National Australia Bank Ltd\neconomist Brian Hamley said.\n    \"There is a 'flight to quality',\" Hamley said. \"Australia may\nnot be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't too\nmany other countries where you'd want to put your money.\"\n    The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting\ninvestors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against\nthe volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.\n    \"We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.\nWhere some people would be concerned about the value of the\nU.S. Dollar,\" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose\nsaid. \"Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap\nand the currency looks stable?\"\n    But turning that capital into more permanent productive\ninvestment depends on government economic policy, he said.\n    \"It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the\ndirection in the economy,\" Buttrose said, adding that offshore\ninvestors would carefully watch the government's promised tough\neconomic statement on May 14.\n    While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding\ninterest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as\neasily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were\nbadly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar\nand hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.\n    \"It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be\ndelivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, one\nmight see a substantial outflow,\" Buttrose said.\n    Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough\neconomic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and\nstubborn current account deficit, analysts said.\n    \"They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think\nthey would like to leave the money here,\" Buttrose said.\n    Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased\ninterest in investment in Australia and the need to shield\nJapanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.\n    Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an\nelement of targeting the rate against the yen in currency\npolicy when he said authorities could not take their \"eyes off\nthe yen\" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.\n    Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked\nsuccessfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar\nwithin the range of 100 to 103 yen.\n    Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the\nAustralian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a\ntrade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.\n    Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming\nAustralian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other\nmarkets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the\nweight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into\nequities, particularly in the gold sector.\n    The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3\ntoday, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while\nthe gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the\nsame period.\n    The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese\ncompanies that have invested heavily in the United States in\nrecent years turning their attention to undervalued real\nestate, particularly in the tourism field.\n    Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-star\nRegent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs\nas indicative of the type of property being sought.\n    \"They think they find good value real estate here which,\nwith long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of\ninvestment Australia needs,\" Buttrose added.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
