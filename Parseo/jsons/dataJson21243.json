        "BODY": "The Senate Agriculture Committee was\nexpected to consider proposals that would limit adjustments in\ncounty loan rate differentials which trigger larger corn and\nwheat acreage reduction requirements, Senate staff said.\n    A budget-saving proposal drafted by chairman Patrick Leahy\n(D-Vt) would limit adjustments in county loan rate\ndifferentials to no more than one pct per year from the\nnational average loan rate, starting with 1988 crops.\n    The plan also would allow the Agriculture Secretary to\nincrease the unpaid acreage reduction requirement for corn by\n\"an appropriate amount to generate savings\" if projected corn\nstocks exceeded 6.0 billion bushels.\n    Leahy's proposal would also allow a larger 1988 wheat set\naside if projected stocks surpassed 1.9 billion bushels.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
