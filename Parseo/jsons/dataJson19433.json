        "BODY": "The Administration asked Congress to\nreplace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring it\ninto line with international tariff categories, U.S. Trade\nRepresentative Clayton Yeutter said.\n    The new system will add such items as fiber optics and more\naccurately define new composites, items not widely traded when\nthe current schedule was devised some 30 years ago.\n    Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule is\ncalled, will change tariff categories and definitions to meet\nthe present-day needs of exporters and importers, but they\nshould pay about the same rates of duties.\n    Yeutter said, \"American exporters will find it far easier to\ndeal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety of\ndiffering systems which they now face.\"\n    He said the new system ended 12 years of multinational\nnegotiations to create the unified tariff schedule.\n    Yeutter said government and business moves are based on\ndata from tariff schedules and the new system will improve\nknowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making.\n    He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards under\nthe new system, with about half expected to join the system by\nJanuary 1988.\n reuter\n\u0003"
