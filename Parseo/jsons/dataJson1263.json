        "BODY": "Alcan Aluminium Ltd said it joined with\nCarrozzeria Bertone S.P.A. to exhibit Alcan's technology in\naluminum structured vehicles at Geneva's international auto\nsalon.\n    Alcan said it and Bertone have built several Bertone X1/9\nsports cars with structures of adhesively bonded sheet\naluminum. It said the bodies were made on presses used for\nBertone's steel-structured sports cars.\n    Alcan said two of the cars are currently being tested in\nBritain by the Motor Industry Research Association.\n     Alcan said it has developed and tested the aluminum\nstructure technology so that it is suitable for modern auto\nmaking methods and plants.\n    Alcan said the technology, which reduces the weight of a\ncar's basic structure by up to 50 pct, can improve handling and\nperformance and reduce fuel consumption for any size car. It\nsaid the structures also provide long life without the need for\nrust protection.\n    The structure provides the same stiffness and safety as\npresent materials, while continuously bonded seams allow a 65\npct reduction in spot welds, Alcan said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
