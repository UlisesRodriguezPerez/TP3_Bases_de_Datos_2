        "DATELINE": "    LOS ANGELES, March 13 - ",
        "BODY": "Caesars World Inc said its board\nunanimously rejected a 28 dlr a share takeover offer by New\nYork investor Martin T. Sosnoff.\n    Caesars said Sosnoff's offer to by all its outstanding\nshares of common stock was inadequate and not in the best\ninterests of its shareholders.\n    The company recommended that shareholders reject Sosnoff's\noffer, made through his <MTS Acquisition Corp>, and not tender\nany of their shares.\n    Caesars said it will explore a variety of alternative\ntransactions but did not elaborate.\n    Caesars, in a brief statement, did not say whether it would\nseek to buy back its shares held by Sosnoff.\n    A Caesars spokesman said the company would not comment\nfurther on its decision.\n    On Wednesday, Sosnoff told the Securities and Exchange\nCommission that he controls 13.6 pct of the company's stock.\n    Sosnoff also informed the SEC that Caesars had offered to\nbuyout his holdings several times during the past year.\n    No one from the Sosnoff organization was immediately\navailable for comment.\n    Caesars said its financial advisor, Drexel Burnham Lambert\nInc, had determined that Sosnoff's offer was financially\ninadequate for shareholders other than Sosnoff.\n    The company said other factors it considered in rejecting\nthe offer were its financial condition, future prospects,\ncurrent market conditions and the numerous conditions on which\nSosnoff's bid was conditioned.\n    Caesars' stock opened up 1/8 point at 28-1/8. That is 1/8\npoint above Sosnoff's offer price.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
