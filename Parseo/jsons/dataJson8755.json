        "BODY": "<A/S Norske Shell>, Royal\nDutch/Shell Group's <RD.AS> Norwegian subsidiary, said it has\nnearly concluded a 10 billion crown development scheme for\nNorway's Draugen oil field and will declare the field\ncommercial in the near future.\n    Pending government approval of the scheme, the field could\ncome on stream in 1992, making it Norway's northermost field\ndevelopment and the first such project on the Haltenbanken\ntract off central Norway.\n    Work on the project could begin as early as January 1988, a\nShell spokesman said.\n    Shell has not released projected output levels for the\nfield, where water depth is 240-270 meters.\n    The spokesman said the field's partners have agreed to\ndevelop Draugen with a 300-meter, single-leg concrete\ngravity-base platform.\n    The scheme also proposes using remote subsea production\nwells to tap the field's reservoir, estimated to contain 375\nmln barrels of oil, and an offshore buoy-loading system to\ntransport oil from the field by ship.\n    Partners on Draugen are Shell, the operator, with a 30 pct\nstake, British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L> unit <BP Petroleum\nDevelopment (Norway) Ltd> (20 pct) and state-owned Den Norske\nStats Oljeselskap A/S <STAT.OL> (Statoil) (50 pct).\n REUTER\n\u0003"
