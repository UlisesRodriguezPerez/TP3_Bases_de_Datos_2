        "BODY": "Fabrique Nationale Herstal SA\n<FNHB.BR> said it suffered a net loss of 2.99 billion francs\nlast year after being hit by strikes, the falling dollar and\ndeclining oil prices.\n    An FN statement said the loss, which compared with a 6.8\nmln franc profit the previous year, included considerable\ncharges for restructuring in 1986 and 1987. Without these the\nnet loss would have been 1.45 billion francs, it said.\n    It added that the restructuring plan would allow the firm\nto return to long term profitability once it had been approved\nby local authorities, banks and the workforce.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
