        "BODY": "The British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L> said\nit had no plans to close its refinery in Gothenburg, despite\nforecasts by a Swedish finance ministry committee that it might\nbe planning such a move.\n    The committee said the refinery's future looked bleak\nbecause the Swedish petroleum industry's competitiveness was\nexpected to worsen unless it invested, and because of the\neffects of a possible tightening of rules on sulphur content.\n    But BP said the unit, in which Sweden's <OK Petroleum AB>\nhas a 22 pct stake, had performed well both technically and\nfinancially up to and including the first quarter of 1987.\n    Current restrictions on sulphur emissions and known future\nplans for both Sweden and export markets did not cause it any\nserious problems, it said in a statement.\n    The refinery started up in 1967 and has an annual capacity\nof 4.7 mln tonnes.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
