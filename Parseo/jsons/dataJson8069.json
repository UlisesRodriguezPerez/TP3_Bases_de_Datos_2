        "BODY": "World Bank President Barber Conable is\nexpected to press Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largest\ndebtor, to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes to\ntackle the slump in its oil revenues, western diplomats said.\n    Conable, who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo, will\nmeet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers.\n    He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia's\nlargest nation was being managed well, but the slump in world\noil prices called for major policy adjustments.\n    Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projects\nin the eastern section of Java, Indonesia's most populous\nisland. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed\ndiscussions with ministers tomorrow.\n    Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severely\nhit by last year's crash in oil prices, which cut its oil and\ngas revenues in half.\n    Japan's state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to\nprovide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia\npay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects.\n    Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded to\nthe oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31\npct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans to\nbridge its deficit.\n    Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto\nand leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy\nchange, particularly in dismantling Indonesia's high-cost\nprotected economy.\n    \"Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all call\nfor major policy adjustments and external support,\" Conable said\nin his arrival statement.\n    But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next\nmonth, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that\nthe Bank is demanding specific changes.\n    \"We believe there has been wise leadership here and the\neconomy is being very well managed,\" Conable told reporters at\nJakarta airport.\n    Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling\n37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it the\nThird World's sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7\nbillion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968.\n    Conable did not spell out what further changes he would\nlike to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes\nalready introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more.\n    Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support,\nthe Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the\ngovernment's trade reform measures, and supported its\ndetermination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth.\n    Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last\nMay to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourage\noutside investment.\n    Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look\ninto which of Indonesia's 215 state-run companies could be\nsold.\n    But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said the\ngovernment appeared divided over how far to take its reforms.\n    Western analysts say that in particular the government is\nunsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia's high-cost\nmonopolies, which control core areas of the economy.\n    Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that\nIndonesia faced very limited economic choices.\n    It could not spend its way out of trouble because this\nwould increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic\ninflation.\n     He said the main objective was to raise exports outside\nthe oil and natural gas sector.\n    Indonesia's current account deficit is projected by the\ngovernment to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financial\nyear which starts on April 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in\n1986/87.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
