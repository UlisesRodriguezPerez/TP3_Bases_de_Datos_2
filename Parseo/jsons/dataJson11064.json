        "DATELINE": "    New York, March 30 - ",
        "BODY": "Texas' cotton crop stands little\nchance of damage from frigid temperatures expected tonight in\nthat state, as very little cotton has been planted, according\nto Texas agricultural sources and cotton market analysts.\n    \"It's still pretty early for cotton planting. Only six pct\nof the crop was planted as of last week,\" said Doug Stillmann,\na statistician at the Texas Agricultural Statistic Service in\nAustin, a division of the U.S. Agriculture Department.\n    Stillmann and other cotton market sources said planting had\nbegun in the Rio Grande Valley and South Texas areas only, with\nplanting in the crucial high and low plains areas not slated to\nbegin until next month. The high and low plains accounted for\n60 pct of the 2.5 mln bales produced in Texas last year,\nStillmann said.\n    Temperatures tonight in most of Texas are expected to drop\nto freezing to the low 20s, although the lower Rio Grande\nValley may see more moderate readings in the middle 30s,\naccording to meteorologists at Accu-Weather Inc.\n    The price of new-crop cotton on the New York cotton futures\nmarket rallied today on weather-related fears.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
