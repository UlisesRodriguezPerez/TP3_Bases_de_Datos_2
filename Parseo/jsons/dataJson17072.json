        "BODY": "Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said\nJapan has no plans to take new emergency measures to support\nthe dollar, other than foreign exchange intervention.\n    He also told reporters that many major nations yesterday\nintervened heavily to support the dollar against the yen.\n    Yesterday's intervention was large in terms of the\ncountries involved and the amounts expended, he said.\n    With the continued fall of the dollar against the yen,\nspeculation had arisen in currency markets here that Japan\nmight take new measures to support the U.S. Currency, such as\ncurbing capital outflows.\n    Miyazawa said that yesterday's news of a 4.3 pct rise in\nU.S. Gnp in the first quarter had been expected. Although the\ngrowth looks robust on the surface, the figures in reality are\nnot that good, he said.\n    He said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is\nexpected to come up with a final set of recommendations of ways\nto stimulate the Japanese economy before Prime Minister\nYasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington next week.\n    Commenting on yesterday's report on economic restructuring\nby a high-level advisory panel to Nakasone, Miyazawa said it\nwas important to put the panel's recommendations into effect.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
