        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, March 17 - ",
        "BODY": "Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel\nLawson's Budget speech was described as sound and well balanced\nby analysts, if slightly lacking in excitement.\n    A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected\ntomorrow, with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall. A\nfollow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week.\n    \"Worthy but boring would probably sum it up,\" Peter Fellner,\nU.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said. \"It was\na very, very prudent fiscal budget.\"\n    Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was a\nwell-balanced budget within the confines of the government's\nphilosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat.\n    Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscal\nside, but offered nothing new on monetary policy.\n    As was widely expected, Lawson split his \"fiscal adjustment\"\nbetween trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stg\nfrom 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to\n27 pct.\n    The target for the narrow measure of money supply, M0, was\nkept unchangd at two to six pct, while the target for the broad\nSterling M3 aggregate was dropped.\n    Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way for\na half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow, but the\nauthorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately.\nMany analysts and currency dealers have forecast a full\none-point cut tomorrow.\n    \"The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action which\nit will have to reverse later,\" Jeffrey said, though he added a\nfurther half-point cut was quite possible in the near future.\n    The main worry from today's speech is the outlook for\ninflation, given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained\nin it, Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said.\n    Holt noted the \"rather loose\" inflation forecast of 4.0 pct\nat end-1987, and said the lower interest rates likely to result\nfrom the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern.\n    \"A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term,\"\nhe said, although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of\nfalling base rates would have an offsetting impact on\ninflation.\n    The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence but\nit was \"not a good budget for inflation,\" he said\n    Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about\nthe dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was not\ntoo concerned about a revival of inflation.\n    Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the\n\"leading edge\" of monetary policy, but said the authorities were\nlikely to be extremely cautious on this front.\n    He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest\nrates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any\nsigns of excessive weakness.\n    Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibility\nof the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts.\n    Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from\n1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets,\nwhich are already discounting that amount, Jeffrey said.\nthat the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility by\nthe favourable outturn for 1986/87, which is now also forecast\nto be 4.0 billion stg.\n    But analysts said the Budget speech did not give any\nclear-cut indication about the timing of the general election,\nwhich has to be held before June, 1988.\n    Some believe it signals a poll this June, noting that the\nbenefits, such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise\nduties on alcohol and tobacco, become available immediately.\n    But others said it kept several options open and it was not\npossible to deduce too much from it.\n    James Capel's Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent,\nLawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in\nthat there would be no \"chickens coming home to roost.\"\n    Richard Jeffrey, who favours the likelihood of a June\nelection, said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for\na Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory.\n    Nevertheless, he said, it was likely to result in a boost\nto the Conservative Party's pre-election popularity.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
