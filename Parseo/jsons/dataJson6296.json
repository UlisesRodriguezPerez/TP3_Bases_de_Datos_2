        "BODY": "Kansas Republican Congressman Pat\nRoberts urged the Reagan administration to offer export\nenhancement program, eep, subsidies to the Soviet Union.\n    Speaking at a House foreign agriculture subcommittee,\nRoberts said the U.S. has offered eep to China and Poland, and\nshould also include the Soviet Union.\n    Rep. Roberts said there had been some talk that the issue\nof an eep to Moscow had not been raised within the Reagan\nadministration recently because Secretary of State George\nShultz was out of the country.\n    \"That very well may be the case,\" said Tom Kay, U.S.\nAgriculture Department Foreign Agricultural Service\nadministrator. However, Kay told Reuters later that his reply\nto Roberts was not based on any particular knowledge.\n    Rep. Roberts urged Kay to convey to top officials of the\nUSDA that some in Congress favor a wheat eep to Moscow.\n    \"I'd be delighted to deliver the message,\" Kay replied.\n    Earlier, Kay had repeated Agriculture Secretary Richard\nLyng's statement last week that \"the door is not yet closed on\nan eep to the Soviet Union.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
