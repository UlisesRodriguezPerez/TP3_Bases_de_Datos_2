        "BODY": "Istanbul remained at a virtual\nstandstill today under snow up to a meter deep but shipping was\nmoving through the narrow Bosphorus waterway linking the Sea of\nMarmara and the Black Sea, officials said.\n    The authorities ordered government offices closed until\nWednesday. Many banks, businesses and schools stayed shut as\nworkers struggled to keep main roads and supply lines open in\nthis city of 6.5 mln people.\n    The second blizzard to hit Istanbul in a week stopped\nyesterday afternoon and the international airport reopened\ntoday after a two-day closure. It was also shut earlier last\nweek.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
