        "DATELINE": "    BAHRAIN, March 30 - ",
        "BODY": "Bahrain is introducing a new domestic\nmoney market regime to provide dinar liquidity aid centred on\nthe island's newly launched treasury bill programme.\n    The Bahrain Monetary Agency has issued a circular to all\ncommercial banks outlining a new policy from April 1 which\ngives liquidity aid through sale and repurchase agreements in\ntreasury bills, or through discounting them.\n    The circular, released officially to Reuters, said current\narrangements for providing liquidity aid will no longer be\nvalid except \"in quite exceptional circumstances.\"\n    Under the current system, the agency provides the island's\n20 commercial banks with dinar liquidity by means of short-term\nswaps against U.S. Dollars and, less frequently, by short-term\nloans secured against government development bonds.\n    \"The agency considers that it is now appropriate to replace\nthese operations with short-term assistance based on Government\nof Bahrain treasury bills,\" the circular to banks states.\n    The agency said it will repurchase treasury bills with a\nsimultaneous agreement to resell them to the same bank at a\nhigher price which will reflect an interest charge.\n    The agency said it envisages the repurchase agreements will\nnormally be for a period of seven days.\n    Bahrain launched a weekly tender for two mln dinars of\n91-day treasury bills in mid-December last year and has since\nraised a total of 26 mln dinars through the programme.\n    Bahrain's commercial banks are currently liquid and have\nbeen making little use of the traditional dollar swaps offered\nby the agency. But banking sources said the new regime from\nApril 1 will mean banks cannot afford not to hold treasury\nbills in case they need funds from the central bank.\n    Banking sources said more than half of the 20 banks hold\ntreasury bills, although the need by others to take up paper\ncould increase demand at weekly tenders and push down allotted\nyields slightly.\n    Last week's yield was six pct, although the programme had\nstarted at the end of last year with rates as low as 5.60 pct.\n    Banking sources said the cost of liquidity through\nrepurchase accords will not differ much from that on dollar\nswaps. But a bank using dollars to obtain liquidity would\nforesake interest on the U.S. Currency while the underlying\ntreasury bill investment is unaffected in a repurchase accord.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
