        "DATELINE": "    HOUSTON, March 24 - ",
        "BODY": "CRS Sirrine Inc said it plans a major\nrestructuring of its balance sheet that will include a\nwrite-off of between 39 mln and 43 mln dlrs, most of which\nwould be intangible goodwill from the company's past\nacquisitions.\n    The company said the remainder of its write-off would\ninclude a one-time expense for future costs related to early\nretirement programs, office consolidations and an increase in\nthe general reserve for adjustments and contingencies.\n    Bruce Wilkinson, president of the company, said the charges\nto the company's third quarter earnings, for the period ending\nMarch 31, would \"significantly impact\" third quarter results\nbut would not affect the company's cash position.\n    \"We expect to have the biggest operating backlog in the\ncompany's history by June 30, 1987, the end of our fiscal\nyear,\" Wilkinson said. \"We believe the action being proposed\nwill begin to contribute to improved earnings in the fourth\nquarter of our fiscal 1987 and throughout fiscal 1988.\"\n    The company, which is one of the nation's largest\nconstruction firms, also said termination of its defined\nbenefit retirement plan would produce a pre-tax benefit of\nabout 10 mln dlrs due to overfunding of the plan.\n    In its second quarter ended Dec. 31, CRSS had net earnings\nof 800,000 dlrs on revenues of 82.5 mln dlrs.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
