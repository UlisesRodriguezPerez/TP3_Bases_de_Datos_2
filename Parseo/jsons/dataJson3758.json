        "BODY": "Mitchell Energy and\nDevelopment Corp said it plans to hold its capital spending in\nfiscal 1988, ending January 31, to 96 mln dlrs, down from the\n123 mln dlrs spent in 1987 and 213 mln dlrs in 1986.\n    The company also said its natural gas revenues so far this\nyear have been reduced by lower contract customer purchases due\nto mild weather and soft economic conditions.\n    \"But the contracts call for the lower 'takes' to be made up\nduring the course of the year,\" Mitchell Energy said. Meanwhile\nit will sell additional quantities of gas on the spot market.\n    Mitchell Energy said the additional spot sales will tend to\nlower the average price realized for gas in the early part of\nfiscal 1988.\n    However, it said the average for the full year is not\nexpected to be significantly lower than the 2.99 dlrs per\nthousand cubic feet averaged in fiscal 1987.                   \n   \n Reuter\n\u0003"
