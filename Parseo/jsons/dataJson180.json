        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - ",
        "BODY": "The U.S. Agriculture Department is not\nactively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet\nUnion under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDA\nofficials said.\n    However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not\nbeen ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in\nthe very near future.\n    \"The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again,\"\nan aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. \"But there\njust isn't much talk about it, informally or formally.\"\n    Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident\nthan USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the\nSoviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer\nwhen they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier\nthis week.\n    But administration and private sources agreed that if the\nReagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to\nMoscow, it could take several months.\n    \"I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any\ninteragency process,\" the aide to Lyng said.\n    \"An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight,\"\nsaid one former USDA official, who noted that the\nadministration took three months to decide in favor of selling\nChina wheat under the subsidy program.\n    An official representing a large grain trade company said\ndeliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of\nCongress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat\nsubsidy offer to the Soviets.\n    But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to\nCapitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press the\nsecretary on the subsidy question a single time.\n    The administration's interagency trade policy review group,\ncomprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to\nclear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officials\nat the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said.\n    In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the\nadministration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any\nnew initiative. One USDA official who took part in the\nconsultations this week described them as an exchange of \"calm,\nbasic, factual economics.\"\n    Another USDA official said there was \"not even an informal\nsuggestion or hint\" that the Soviets would live up to their\npledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were\ngranted more favorable terms.\n    USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an\nEEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be\ndelayed because of disarray within the White House stemming\nfrom the Iran arms affair.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
