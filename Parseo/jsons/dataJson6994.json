        "BODY": "The European Community (EC) farmers'\nand farm cooperatives lobbies, Copa and Cogeca, have backed the\nEC Commission plan for an oils and fats price stabilisation\nmechanism, claiming it would not harm consumers.\n    In a letter to Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans,\ncurrent president of the EC Council of Ministers, they said the\nmechanism, often referred to as a tax, would in fact subsidise\noils and fats prices in the EC under some circumstances.\n    This would have been the case in May 1984, when soya oil\nprices cif Rotterdam stood at 914 dlrs a tonne, they noted.\n    If such price stabilisation is not implemented, EC farmers\nshould not be the ones to suffer through their prices and\nincomes from the financial consequences, the letter, made\navailable to journalists, said.\n    Under the Commission proposal the mechanism would initially\nresult in a tax of 330 Ecus a tonne on both imported and EC\nproduced oils and marine fats.\n    The mechanism would provide for this tax to be reduced, and\npossibly to become a subsidy, as world soya oil prices rose\nfrom present levels.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
