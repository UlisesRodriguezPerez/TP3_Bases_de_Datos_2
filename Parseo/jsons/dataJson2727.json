        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 6 - ",
        "BODY": "U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard\nLyng said he is \"very disappointed\" by a Canadian government\nfinding that U.S. corn has injured Ontario Corn growers.\n    \"This action is not helpful in the context of the ongoing\nU.S.-Canada free trade talks or in the new round of\nmultilateral trade negotiations,\" Lyng said in a statement.\n    The Canadian government today said Ottawa would continue to\napply a duty of 84.9 cents per bushel on U.S. corn imports.\n    Lyng said the U.S. made a case that U.S. corn imports are\nnot the cause of any problem of Canadian corn producers, adding\nthat U.S. corn exports to Canada are declining.\n    \"Apparently they (Canada) have ignored the fact that\nCanadian corn and other coarse grain production is rising\nfaster than consumption,\" Lyng said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
