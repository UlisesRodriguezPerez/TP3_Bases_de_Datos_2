        "DATELINE": "    New York, March 18 - ",
        "BODY": "GAMCO Investors Inc, an affiliate of\nGabelli and Co, plans to propose an anti-greenmail provision at\nthe GenCorp Inc annual meeting March 31, according to GAMCO\nChairman Mario Gabelli.\n    Greenmail often involves the repurchase of shares at a\npremium by a company from an unwanted investor. GenCorp today\nreceived a surprise tender offer from a group that holds 9.8\npct of its stock.\n    Gabelli also said GAMCO has sent a 13-D filing to the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission on the 6.5 pct of GenCorp\nstock held by GAMCO and its affiliates.\n    The stock amounts to 1,462,000 shares and most of it was\nreported in an earlier 13-G filing. A 13-G is filed by passive\ninvestors to show holdings of more than five pct.\n    Earlier today, General Partners, owned by Wagner and Brown\nand AFG Industries Inc, launched a 100 dlr per share tender\noffer for GenCorp. Analysts said the offer was between 10 and\n20 dlrs per share too low.\n    GenCorp has made no comment on the offer.\n    Gabelli said he also proposes that management consider\nspinning off all assets, other than the GenCorp broadcast\nproperties, to shareholders. The licenses of the broadcast\nproperties have long been entangled in a series of challenges.\n    \"One thing is going to be clear and that is I'm going to\nthe meeting and putting up \"no greenmail,\" Gabelli said.\n    Gabelli said he fears that greenmail might be a motivation\nin the offer.\n    The annual meeting is to be held in Akron, Ohio.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003"
