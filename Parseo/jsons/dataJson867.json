        "BODY": "Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment\nrate rose to a record 3.0 pct in January, the worst since the\nGovernment started compiling unemployment statistics under its\ncurrent system in 1953, up from the previous record 2.9 pct in\nDecember, the government's Management and Coordination Agency\nsaid.\n    Unemployment was up from 2.8 pct a year earlier.\n    Unadjusted January unemployment totalled 1.82 mln people,\nup from 1.61 mln in December and 1.65 mln a year earlier.\n    Male unemployment in January remained at 2.9 pct, equal to\nthe second-worst level set last December. Record male\nunemployement of 3.1 pct was set in July 1986.\n    Female unemployment in January remained at 3.0 pct, equal\nto the record level marked in April, August, September and\nDecember last year.\n    January's record 3.0 pct unemployment rate mainly stemmed\nfrom loss of jobs in manufacturing industries, particularly in\nexport-related firms, due to the yen's continuing appreciation\nagainst the dollar, officials said.\n    Employment in manufacturing industries fell 380,000 from a\nyear earlier to 14.30 mln including 1.83 mln employed in the\ntextile industry, down 190,000 from a year earlier, and 1.06\nmln in transport industries such as carmakers and shipbuilders,\ndown 170,000.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
