        "BODY": "Grain traders and analysts look for a\n10 to 12 mln acre sign-up in the USDA's conservation reserve\nprogram, scheduled to be announced after 1400 CST today.\n    The USDA probably will accept about 80 to 90 pct of the\nacres submitted, they said.\n    Total enrollment in the first three years of the program is\nonly 8.9 mln acres, so the sharp increase expected this year\nhas underpinned new crop corn futures all week.\n    However, some analysts said a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up may\nend up being negative to new crop corn prices, citing trade\ntalk earlier this year that 14 to 15 mln acres may be submitted\nby farmers. Also, acres set-aside under the conservation\nprogram are by definition poor yielding, so the impact on total\ncorn production will be minimal, they added.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
