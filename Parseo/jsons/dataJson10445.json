Lego, senior executive vice president told the\nanalysts \"our plans do not call for a multibillion dlr\nacquisition, even though our balance sheet can handle one.\nDespite this disclaimer, if we identify a major acquisition\nthat has significnt value-creating for Westinghouse...we will\nconsider it.\" He said the company would consider an acquisition\ncandidate that is in an area compatable with Westinghouse's\nprimiary businesses.\n    Danforth said the corportation was focused in several key\nareas including defense electronics, financial services,\nbroadcasting, electrical products and services for construction\nand industrial and utility markets.\n    Danforth added that he expects Westinghouse's sales to grow\nfaster than the markets the corportation serves and \"surely\nfaster than GNP.\"\n    He said earnings per share growth is expected to\nconsistently exceed the Standard and Poor's 500 index and\nreturn on equity will remain in the 18 to 21 pct range.\n    Leo W. Yochum, senior executive vice president for finance,\ntold the analysts \"we will consider buying back stock\" but\nthere are no current plans for such a buyback.\n    Yochum said that at the company's current level of earnings\nit could comfortably maintain higher debt levels and that\nWestinghouse will use its debt capacity to improve shareholder\nvalue.\n    Last year, Westinghouse established a 790 mln dlrs\nrestructuring reserve to be used for plant consolodation,\nassett writedowns and other items.
