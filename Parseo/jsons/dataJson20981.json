        "BODY": "U.S. warships destroyed an Iranian oil\nplatform in the Gulf on Monday and the Navy also raided a\nsecond oil rig in retaliation for Friday's Iranian missile\nattack on a U.S. flag tanker, the Pentagon said.\n    President Reagan and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger\nwarned Iran of even stronger countermeasures if the military\nescalation between the two countries continued in the volatile\nwaterway.\n    Reagan said he ordered the strike on the first platform by\nfour U.S. destroyers, which fired about 1,000 five-inch shells\nat the Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central\nGulf.\n    A short time later, Navy personnel boarded a second Iranian\noil platform about five miles to the north and destroyed radar\nand communications equipment before leaving the structure, the\nPentagon said.\n     Defense Department spokesman Fred Hoffman told reporters\nthat the second platform had been abandoned by Iranian\npersonnel during the shelling and destruction of the first rig.\n    The United States said both platforms were being used to\nkeep track of Gulf merchant shipping and to launch speedboat\nattacks on such shipping by Iranian Revolutionary guards.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
