        "BODY": "Spain's Finance Ministry deregulated bank\ndeposit rates in an effort to raise competition among banks and\nbring legislation into line with the European Community (EC), a\nministry spokesman said.\n    The measure was published today in the Official State\nGazette. It takes effect tomorrow and lifts restrictions on\nrates, now limited to six pct on deposits of up to 180 days.\n    The government also enacted a decree cutting to one pct\nfrom 13 pct the proportion of total assets which banks must\nlend at favourable rates to industries classified \"of public\ninterest.\"\n    Some bankers expect the deregulation of rates to result in\na 20 pct drop in profits this year.\n    Secretary of State for the Economy Guillermo de la Dehesa\ntold Reuters in a recent interview the reduction in fixed asset\ninvestments would offset losses from the rate liberalisation.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
