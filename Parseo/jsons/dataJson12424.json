The\nfarmers expect rain this week. If it does not fall output of\nthe late (October-November-December) crop will decline sharply,\"\none source said.\n    He said that since most growers did not irrigate their crop\nthey could do nothing but wait for rain, the main factor which\ndetermines Kenyan coffee production.\n    Two months ago the International Coffee Organization issued\na forecast of Kenyan exportable coffee production in the\n1986/87 (Oct-Sept) season at 1.82 mln bags.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
