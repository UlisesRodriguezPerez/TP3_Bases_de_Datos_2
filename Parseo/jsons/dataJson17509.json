        "DATELINE": "    LUSAKA, June 1 - ",
        "BODY": "The Zambian government today announced\nminor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its new\neconomic strategy, while police and troops patrolled the\nnorthern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.\n    However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal,\nwere not affected by the cuts and many people said this could\nprovoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected more\nsweeping reductions.\n    Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with the\nsmall extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct on\nitems such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.\n    Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone said\ngovernment forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.\n    In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no sign\nof troops or police reinforcements on the streets.\n    President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to take\naccount of lower import costs following the revaluation of the\nkwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.\n    The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economic\nstrategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia's IMF austerity\nprogram.\n    Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs of\nunemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatile\nregion to take action against shops that did not reduce their\nprices after today's deadline. Fifteen people were killed in\nthe Copperbelt during food riots last December after the\ngovernment tried to lift maize subsidies.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
