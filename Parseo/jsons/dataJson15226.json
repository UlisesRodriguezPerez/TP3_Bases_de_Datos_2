        "BODY": "Showboat Inc will take a\ncharge of 19 to 20 mln dlrs pretax against results for the\nthird quarter ended March 31, director and assistant to the\npresident J. Kell Houssels III told Reuters.\n    He said the charge results from pre-operating expenses of\nits recently-opened Atlantic City, N.J., Showboat Hotel, Casino\nand Bowling Center and will cause a loss for the third quarter\nand probably for all of fiscal 1987 as well.\n    But Houssels said Showboat's earnings for fiscal 1988\nshould show a sharp increase from fiscal 1986 levels due to the\ncontribution of the new Atlantic City facility.\n    Showboat earned 1,753,000 dlrs in last year's third\nquarter.  For all of fiscal 1986 it earned 5,769,000 dlrs.\n    Houssels said Showboat since the opening of the Atlantic\nCity hotel/casino, Showboat has had to start charging interest\nexpenses connected with debt it sold to finance the facility\ndirectly against income rather than capitalizing the interest\nas it had been able to do previously.\n    Showboat opened the hotel during its third quarter and\ngaming began last Thursday on a regular basis after test gaming\nwas completed earlier in the week.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
