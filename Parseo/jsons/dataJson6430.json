        "BODY": "Italy's <Gruppo Ferruzzi> is in the\nadvanced stages of negotiations that could result in an\nacquisition worth \"some hundreds of billions of lire\" in the\nEuropean agro-industrial sector, a company spokesman told\nReuters.\n    The spokesman declined to identify the other party or\nparties involved in talks, or whether a complete takeover was\nunder discussion, but said an Italian newspaper report that\nFerruzzi was studying the possibility of advancing an offer for\n13 European cereal processing plants owned by the U.S. Group\nCPC International Inc <CPC.N> was incorrect.\n    The spokesman said that possibility had been evaluated by\nFerruzzi but that the company's attention at the moment was\n\"decisively in another direction.\"\n    The spokesman, responding to a report in the Italian\neconomic daily Il Sole-24 Ore that Ferruzzi was considering a\npossible bid for the CPC plants, told Reuters his company hoped\nto conclude the talks currently underway in a couple of months.\n    The spokesman said that since the U.K. Government last\nmonth blocked Ferruzzi's bid to acquire <British Sugar Plc>,\nthe company had been looking at other investment opportunities.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
