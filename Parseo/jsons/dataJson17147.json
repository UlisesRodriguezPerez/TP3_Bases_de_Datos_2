        "DATELINE": "    HELSINKI, April 24 - ",
        "BODY": "The Bank of Finland said it was\nreducing restrictions on the use of money market rates as\nreference rates for loans.\n    The Bank would start quoting money market rates referred to\nas HELIBOR (Helsinki Interbank Offered Rate). Banks may\nhenceforth use these as reference rates in their lending, it\nsaid.\n    From May 1 the banks would be allowed, without special\ncentral bank approval, to use as a reference rate not only its\nbase rate but also other Bank of Finland rates or the official\nmoney market rate used in market transactions.\n    A derivative of these could also be used, the statement\nsaid. But housing loans would be excepted and their lending\nrate would, as formerly, be linked directly or indirectly to\nthe Bank of Finland's base rate.\n    The new guidelines involve mainly two changes. Money market\nrates in future would be used as reference rates for loans with\na maturity of over five years and the introduction of a new\nreference rate would no longer require central bank approval.\n    The decision was made as a continuation of the central\nbank's process of liberalisation, it said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
