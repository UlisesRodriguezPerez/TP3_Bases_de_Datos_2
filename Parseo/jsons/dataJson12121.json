        "BODY": "U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel\nLawson said he wanted sterling to stay roughly where it was,\nspecifying a rate of around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs.\n    He told the National Economic Development Council that the\nrecent Paris meeting of major industrialised nations had agreed\non the need for exchange rate stability. There was now a\n\"reasonable alignment of currencies\" and the U.K. Government\nintended to keep sterling at about its present level, he said.\n    That meant around 2.90 marks, which is the single most\nimportant rate to concentrate on, and 1.60 dlrs, Lawson said.\n    His disclosure of two of the key targets for sterling was\nhighly unusual, foreign exchange market analysts said.\n    In the past he has preferred to be less definite about the\nGovernment's exchange rate policy, lest it give foreign\nexchange markets set limits to test.\n    Lawson told the committee, which is a tripartite forum of\ngovernment, unions and industry, that the pound would be kept\nnear its present level by a mixture of interest rates and\nintervention in the foreign exchange markets.\n    The pound finished trading here today at 1.6040/50 dlrs and\n2.9210/45 marks.\n    His disclosure of two of the key targets for sterling was\nhighly unusual, foreign exchange market analysts said.\n    In the past he has preferred to be less definite about the\nGovernment's exchange rate policy, lest it give foreign\nexchange markets set limits to test.\n    Lawson told the committee, which is a tripartite forum of\ngovernment, unions and industry, that the pound would be kept\nnear its present level by a mixture of interest rates and\nintervention in the foreign exchange markets.\n    The pound finished trading here today at 1.6040/50 dlrs and\n2.9210/45 marks.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
