        "BODY": "Soybeans produced in the United\nStates face a competitive price problem because of the loan\nrate provisions of the 1985 farm bill, U.S. Undersecretary of\nAgriculture Daniel Amstutz said.\n    Amstutz told a House Agriculture Appropriations\nsubcommittee hearing that soybeans are caught in a \"squeeze\"\nbecause the Farm Bill allowed steep cuts in grain loan rates\nwhile limiting the soybean reduction.\n    As a result, he said U.S.-produced soybeans \"have a price\nproblem\" in competing with other soybean producing countries.\n    Amstutz called the situation a \"dilemma\" for the USDA, and\nsaid \"we have spent hours in ASCS (Agriculture Stabilization\nand Conservation Service) looking at this.\"\n    He did not say what may be done to rectify the situation.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
