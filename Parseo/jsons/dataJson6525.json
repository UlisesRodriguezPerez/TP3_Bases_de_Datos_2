        "BODY": "Deutsche Babcock AG\n<DBCG.F> will increase its dividend on results in the year\nending September 30, 1987, chief executive Helmut Wiehn said.\n    Wiehn told a news conference Deutsche Babcock would double\nthe absolute amount it distributes to shareholders. This\noverall increase would also be due partly to an increase of\nnominal share capital by 100 mln marks to 350 mln marks.\n    A higher dividend had been anticipated because Deutsche\nBabcock has said in the past that it will only raise capital\nwhen it can make a lasting improvement in the dividend.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
