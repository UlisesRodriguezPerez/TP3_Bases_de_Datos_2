        "BODY": "Indonesia cannot spend its way out of\nrecession and has very limited economic options due to lower\nworld oil prices, Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar was\nquoted as saying by the official Antara news agency.\n    \"If Indonesia spurs its economic growth too much, such as\nthrough expansionary monetary and budgetary policies, it might\ncreate negative effects not only on price increases, but also\non the balance of payments,\" he told bankers and businessmen in\nthe North Sumatran city of Medan.\n    Antara quoted him as saying Indonesia is relying on its\nexport drive to help narrow its trade deficit.\n    Antara reported that Siregar said the government wanted to\nhelp boost exports from the rubber and palm oil industries,\nwhich are centered in Sumatra.\n    \"I see Sumatra has great potential, as in the plantation\nsector in which family units are employed in great number,\" he\nsaid, according to the agency.\n    Indonesia relied on oil and gas exports for 70 pct of its\nexport revenue until last year's fall in crude prices.\n    It has projected its current account deficit will widen to\nover four billion dlrs in the current financial year ending\nMarch 31 from 1.8 billion in 1985/86.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
