        "BODY": "An investment group led by\nAudio/Video Affiliates Inc said it raised its tender offer to\nacquire Cyclops Corp to 92.50 dlrs a share from 80 dlrs a\nshare.\n    The group, Cyacq Acquisition Corp, also said it extended\nthe offer until April three, from March 20.\n    The group said it added several conditions to its offer,\nincluding receipt of all non-public information about Cyclops\nthat was provided to <Dixons Group PLC> in connection with\nDixon's competing tender offer for Cyclops.\n    Cyacq's sweetened offer, totaling about 398 mln dlrs, tops\nDixon's offer of 92.25 dlrs a share, or about 388 mln dlrs.\n    On Wednesday Dixon said it had bought 54 pct of Cyclops'\n4.3 mln shares outstanding, boosting its stake in the company\nto 56 pct.\n    Earlier today, however, the Securities and Exchange\nCommisssion ordered Dixons to extended its tender offer until\nMarch 24.\n    Cyacq said it hopes Cyclops shareholders \"will withdraw\npreviously tendered shares from Dixons' tender offer to take\nadvantage of Cyacq's higher offer.\"\n    The SEC's order came after Cyacq filed suit to block Dixons\nfrom taking control of Cyclops and to force an extension of\nDixons' tender offer.\n    A Cyclops spokeswoman said the company had no immediate\ncomment on the sweetened bid from Cyacq.\n    Cyacq said its new offer is also subject to Cyclops\nrescinding any agreements with Dixons under which the\nU.K.-based firm would receive \"break-up fees\" or expenses from\nCyclops or could buy Cyclops common stock from the\nPittsburgh-based company.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
