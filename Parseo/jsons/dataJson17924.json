        "BODY": "The United Arab Emirates recorded a\n1986 trade surplus of 12.2 billion dirhams, narrowing from 30.2\nbillion in 1985, the central bank's latest bulletin shows.\n    The central bank said the lower surplus was mainly due to\nthe decline in the value of exports and re-exports to 37.2\nbillion dirhams from 54.2 billion in 1985. This reflected the\ndecline in oil prices last year and difficulties in marketing\nUAE oil, the central bank added.\n    The surplus on the current account narrowed to 6.8 billion\ndirhams from 25.5 billion in 1985. The overall balance showed a\nsurplus of 4.8 billion after 2.6 billion in 1985.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
