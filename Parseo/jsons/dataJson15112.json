        "BODY": "The Association of White Metals has\ndecided to publish a daily tin price here in French francs per\n100 kilos, the French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals said.\n    The price, quoted for the first time yesterday, was\nintroduced as the lack of tin quotes was causing problems for\nsome French companies, a spokesman for the non-ferrous metals\nassociation said.\n    Today's price was set at 4,776 francs per 100 kilos and\nTuesday's at 4,790.\n    The International Chamber of Commerce stopped publishing a\ntin price after the London Metal Exchange (LME) stopped tin\ntrading on October 24, 1985.\n    The Association has tested the basis it uses to calculate a\nFrench franc price over the last few months to ensure it was\nreliable, the spokesman said.\n    The French franc price is pre-tax, for specified quality, a\nminimum 99.9 pct purity, at a French port or border railway\nstation and a minimum delivery of 10 tonnes.\n    The French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals groups various\nmetal associations including the Association of White Metals.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
