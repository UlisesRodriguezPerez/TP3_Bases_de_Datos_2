        "BODY": "Nigeria's Central Bank has changed the\nrules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analysts\nsee as a means of defending the naira currency, which has\ndepreciated steadily.\n    The bank said in a statement that from April 2, banks\nbidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate they\noffered and not, as presently, at the rate of the lowest\nsuccessful bid made at the auction.\n    This should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure\nthat they were successful while paying the lower \"marginal\" rate,\nanalysts said.\n    The Central Bank also announced the auctions would be\nfortnightly, not weekly, beginning on April 2.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
