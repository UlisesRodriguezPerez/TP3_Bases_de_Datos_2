        "BODY": "Italy's state-owned <Banca Nazionale Del\nLavoro-BNL> said it is negotiating to buy a West German bank as\npart of its foreign expansion policy.\n    BNL president Nerio Nesi told a news conference the Italian\nbank was currently involved in talks but declined to name the\nGerman institution.\n    He said the takeover move could be seen as BNL's reply to\nDeutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F>, which entered the Italian market in\nDecember 1986, with the purchase of BankAmerica <BACN>\nsubsidiary <Banca D'America e D'Italia>.\n    Nesi said BNL had also approved a 200 mln dlr credit line\nto the Soviet Union aimed at enabling Soviet companies to pay\nfor Italian imports. He gave no further details.\n    BNL officials said the group had also decided to increase\nits activities in the Soviet Union by opening a representative\noffice in Moscow this month through its subsidiary <Sogecred>,\nwhich specialises in Italian-Soviet trade.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
