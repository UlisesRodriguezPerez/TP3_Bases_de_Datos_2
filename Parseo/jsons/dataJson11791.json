        "BODY": "A U.S. Appeals court last night\nblocked the 860 mln dlr merger of Delta Airlines Inc <DAL.N>\nand <Western Airlines> just hours before it was to go into\neffect because of a dispute over union representation.\n    The ruling came in a lawsuit in which the Air Transport\nEmployees union said Western's management should fulfil a\npromise to honour union contracts if a merger took place.\n    The airlines argued that Western's promise could not be\nenforced in a takeover by a larger company. Airlines officials\ncould not be reached for comment on the ruling, which halts the\nmerger until arbitration on the dispute is completed.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
