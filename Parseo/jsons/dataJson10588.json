        "BODY": "The United States said it was doing\nwhat it could to ease tension in the Aegean as Greek and\nTurkish warships headed for a possible clash over oil drilling\nrights on the sea's continental shelf.\n    State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters,\n\"We have urged both sides to exercise restraint and avoid any\nactions which might exacerbate the situation.\"\n    \"In the light of the most recent developments, we are\nconsulting with the parties and with other interested allies on\nmeans to reduce tensions,\" he added.\n    Redman declined to elaborate on what Washington was doing,\nbut he said an emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors in\nBrussels on the subject was only one path it was pursuing.\n    He also refused to say which side was to blame for the\nrenewed confrontation, saying Washington was still trying to\nascertain all the facts, as Prime minister Andreas Papanderou\nsaid Greece was prepared to tackle any aggressor.\n    \"The crucial point here is that these are two friends and\nallies. We don't want to see tension rise and we are doing what\nwe can to see if we can help here,\" Redman said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
