        "BODY": "The price of gold bullion and share\nprices of North American gold stocks are benefiting from\ncontinued weakness in the U.S. dollar, analysts said.\n    \"There's been a tug of war between the (currency)\nspeculators and the central banks over the U.S. dollar and it\nlooks like the game has gone to the speculators,\" said John Ing\nat Maison Placements Canada Inc.\n    The dollar remained close to post-World War II lows today\nagainst the Japanese yen despite buying by several central\nbanks, including the Federal Reserve, dealers said.\n    A drop in the dollar means uncertainty and gold is the\ntraditional hedge against uncertainty, Ing noted.\n    Another analyst, Richard Cohen at Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd,\nnoted that \"a lot of foreign investors are holding U.S. dollars.\nIf they see they are losing money, they move back into gold.\"\n    A dollar decline also has inflationary implications, Ing\nsaid, adding that Maison Placements sees inflation rising to a\nfour pct annual rate from the current level of about three pct.\n    Ing predicts gold will peak at 510 dlrs this year from its\ncurrent level of about 416 dlrs per ounce. Cohen sees an\naverage price of 425 dlrs, and another analyst, Michael\nPickens, at Yorkton Securities, puts the average at 450 dlrs,\nwith a possible spike above 500 dlrs.\n    However, gold stocks in the U.S. and Canada have risen far\nfaster in recent months than the price of the metal itself,\ncausing concern among analysts that a correction lies somewhere\nin the future. But for now, all analysts say there is no sign\nthe buying pressure is slowing down. \"The stocks have run an\nincredible way,\" Cohen said.\n    On U.S. markets today, ASA Ltd <ASA> rose 4-1/8 to 61-1/2,\nCampbell Red Lake Mines <CRK> was up 1-3/8 and Newmont Gold\n<NGC> increased 1-1/2 to 31-1/4.\n    The Toronto Stock Exchange gold index today was up 268\npoints at 8067.90. Hemlo Gold gained 1-1/4 at 26-3/4, LAC\nMinerals was up 1-5/8 at 41, Placer Development rose 1-1/4 at\n43-3/8 and Lacana Mining gained 1 at 18.\n    Ing pointed out that the TSE gold index has gained 51 pct\nsince December 31, 1986, while the price of bullion has\nincreased six pct. \"Canadian golds have been the top performing\nindex this year,\" he noted.\n    In the U.S., there is \"too much money chasing too few\nstocks,\" Pickens said. And many investing institutions such as\npension funds and insurance companies still have excess cash,\nhe added.\n    Cohen also noted that today's silver price break through\nsix dlrs an ounce indicates small investors are entering the\nprecious metals market and he expects the ratio between gold\nand silver prices to narrow.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
