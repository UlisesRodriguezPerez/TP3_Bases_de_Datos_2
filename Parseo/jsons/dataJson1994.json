        "BODY": "Baker International corp said it has\nfiled suit in state court in Houston to compel Hughes Tool Co\nto complete its proposed merger with Baker.\n    Late yesterday, Hughes said it had terminated the merger\nagreement because Baker would not agree to an alternative\ndivestiture plan devised by Hughes.  Hughes' board had\npreviously found unacceptable a U.S. Justice Department consent\ndecree that would have required broader divestitures.\n    Baker said it has not obtained any satisfactory explanation\nfrom Hughes of its objections to the provisions of the Justice\nDepartment consent decree.\n    Hughes yesterday adjourned the special meeting at which\nshareholders were to vote on the merger without permitting the\ncounting of votes on the deal.  Baker said it believes the vote\nwas overwhelmingly in favor of the merger.\n    Baker said the new terms that Hughes proposed for the\nmerger, as an alternative to the consent decree, were \"more\nburdensome\" than those of the consent decree themselves.\n    Baker said divestitures under the consent decree would\nreduce revenues for the combined company by about 65 mln dlrs\nor three pct.\n    Baker said it will continue to pursue the divestitures of\nthe units named in the consent decree.\n    It said its suit names as defendants Hughes and certain of\nits directors and seeks either an injunction forcing Hughes to\nlive up to the merger agreement or \"substantial\" monetary\ndamages it did not name.\n    Baker said it believes the merger to be in the best\ninterests of shareholders of both companies.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
