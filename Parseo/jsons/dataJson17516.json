        "BODY": "India's state-owned Oil and Natural Gas\nCommission (ONGC) plans to drill more wells in the Bombay\noffshore area, where a well spudded in February this year gave\nboth oil and gas, an ONGC spokesman said.\n    The exploratory well, spudded at a depth of 2,140 metres,\nyielded 2,000 barrels of oil and 180,000 cubic metres of gas\nper day, he said.\n    \"The well, one of the four structures drilled in the area 80\nkm north-west of Bombay, indicates good prospects of both oil\nand gas. We've decided to drill at least three more wells in\nthere before starting production on a commercial scale.\"\n    Production of Bombay High, part of the Bombay offshore\nfield, has stabilised at around 500,000 barrels per day for the\nlast two years.\n    ONGC produced 27.85 mln tonnes of crude in 1986/87 ending\nMarch, up from 27.51 the previous year. Bombay High accounted\nfor 20.61 mln tonnes, marginally up from 20.10 the year before.\nIndia's total oil output is around 30 mln tonnes.\n    ONGC has been exploring the Bombay offshore area, developed\nsince the late 1970s, for more oil as production from Bombay\nHigh has reached a plateau.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
