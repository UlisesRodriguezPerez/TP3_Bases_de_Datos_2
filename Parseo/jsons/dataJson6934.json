        "BODY": "About 9,000 miners employed by the\nstate corporation Comibol went on hunger strike to press for\nhigher wages, a miners union spokesman said.\n     Victor Lopez, executive secretary of the miners union,\ntold a news conference the strikers began to fast in the major\ntin mining districts of oruro and potosi and the action would\nspread tomorrow to la paz and other areas.\n     The government has charged that the strike by the miners\nunion, crippled by massive layoffs, is part of a left-wing\ndestabilisation plan to coincide with the visit of West German\npresident Richard von Weizsaecker, who arrives on a four-day\nofficial tour on Friday.\n     But miners union chief Simon Reyes told reporters the\nstrike had nothing to do with subversion and was to press for\nmore government investment in Comibol.\n     The government of president Victor Paz Estenssoro has\nstreamlined the deficit-ridden state mining corporation laying\noff about 20,000 miners, two-thirds of the workforce, following\na collapse of the international tin price in 1985.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
