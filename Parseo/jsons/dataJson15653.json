        "BODY": "Brazilian cocoa exporters are not\nlikely to follow the example of Cocoa Producers Alliance, CPA,\nmembers, who may limit sales of the product in an effort to\nboost world prices, trade sources said.\n    They said a similar procedure was taken in the past in\nBrazil and that it did not work out according to plans.\n    \"The cocoa market is completely free. Unlike coffee, which\nis controlled through export registrations, cocoa exporters in\nBrazil operate at their own free will,\" a trade source said.\n    The traders were responding to questions whether they would\nfollow the example of CPA members meeting in Yaounde.\n    The sources said the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade\nDepartment, CACEX, never interferes in the cocoa market by\nrejecting sales that do not meet certain price or shipment\ncriteria.\n    \"The position of local producers is always to negotiate as\nthey please. If they buy for ten and sell for eleven and think\nit's a good deal, they are free to go ahead,\" one source added.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
