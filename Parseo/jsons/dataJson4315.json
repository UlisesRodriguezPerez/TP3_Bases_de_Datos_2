        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, March 12 - ",
        "BODY": "Union Pacific Corp said it will sign a\npact in Caracas on March 17 with Petroleos De Venezuela, PDVSA,\nto sell the state owned company half of its Corpus Christi,\nTexas refinery owned by its Union Pacific's Champlin Petroleum\nCo subsidiary.\n    The sale will also include the related marketing and\ndistribution system for the refinery's products.\n    A spokesman for the company said that a statement may be\nissued later today giving details of the transaction.\n    There was no immediate comment from PDVSA officials in New\nYork.\n    The Corpus Christi refinery has a capacity of about 160,000\nbarrels per day, the Union Pacific spokesman said, and is a\nlargely upgraded facility but he would place no value on the\ntransaction.\n    The additional acquisition of refinery and distribution\nassets by PDVSA has been expected as Venezuela has been moving\naggressively to enhance its role in the oil industry from\nproducer to excpanding its presence in the downstream sector.\n    Purchase of part of Champlin's operations also fits a\nprofile which PDVSA officials have said previously they looked\nfor in any acquisition.\n    One PDVSA official said the company was looking for\nindependent oil companies with good refinery and distribution\nnetwork and a strong regional presence.\n    The potential purchase of the interest in Champlin followed\nits earlier acquisition of a part interest in Southland Corp's\n<SLC> Citgo Petroleum Corp subsidiary.\n    In that agreement signed September 15, 1986, PDVSA paid\nSouthland 290 mln dlrs for half of Citgo's stock.\n    The potetnital acquisition of half Champlin's Corpus\nChristi plant will also give Venezuela an additional outlet for\nits crude oil production while giving the refiner an assured\nsource of supply, trade sources said.\n    In the earlier deal with Southland, PDVSA agredd to to\nsupply Citgo with at least 130,000 bpd of crude oil and other\nfeedstocks.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
