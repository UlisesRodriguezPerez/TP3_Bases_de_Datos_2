        "BODY": "South Korea's trade surplus is growing too\nfast and the government has started taking steps to slow it\ndown, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said.\n    He told a press conference the government planned to\nincrease investment, speed up the opening of the local market\nto foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold\nthe surplus \"at a proper level.\"\n    But he said the government would not allow the won to\nappreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea has\nbeen under pressure from Washington to revalue the won.\n    The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus with\nthe U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3\nbillion dlrs in 1985.\n    Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospects\nwere bright for the South Korean economy, but the government\nwould try to hold the current account surplus to around five\nbillion dlrs a year for the next five years.\n    \"Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, five\nbillion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth in\nexports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But now\nthe surplus is growing faster than we expected,\" he said.\n    Trade ministry officials said South Korea's exports rose 35\npct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this\nyear, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.\n    Kim said the swing of South Korea's current account to a\nsurplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr\ndeficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled the\ncountry to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first\ntime.\n    South Korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs\nin 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largest\nin Asia.\n    \"This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the\nmajor constraints on our development... Last year was a major\nturning point for the Korean economy,\" Kim said.\n    Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of\nforeign debt to the country's GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, from\nabout 50 pct in 1986.\n    \"The government, however, does not want to accelerate\nreducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus,\" he\nsaid.\n    Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation\nand lead to trade friction with Seoul's major trading partners,\nparticularly the United States.\n    \"We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, but\nwe are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a\nproper level,\" Kim said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
