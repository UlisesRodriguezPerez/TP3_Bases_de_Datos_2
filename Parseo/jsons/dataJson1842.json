        "BODY": "The failure of talks to introduce\nnew coffee export quotas within the International Coffee\nAgreement, ICA, was preferable to the alternative of Brazil\nhaving a sharply reduced quota, as had been proposed, President\nof the Rio de Janeiro Coffee Trade Association Carlos Calmon\nsaid.\n    He told Reuters proposals to reduce Brazil's quota to 25\npct of the world share from 30 pct at present were unacceptable\nas the country has large stocks and a good harvest is expected.\n    \"Brazil has the capacity to export 20 mln bags this year,\"\nCalmon added.\n    Calmon said, assuming a 58 mln bag global ICA quota,\nBrazil's share under the proposals would have been 14.5 mln\nbags, of which soluble would have accounted for 2.0 mln,\nleaving just 12.5 mln bags of green coffee for export.\n    \"It's a pity the talks broke down, but for Brazil this was\nbetter than such a quota reduction,\" he added.\n    In 1985 Brazil exported 19.6 mln bags of soluble and green\ncoffee, including about two mln bags to non-members. A severe\ndrought and marketing problems cut exports last year to under\n10 mln bags.\n    Calmon estimated stocks as of January 1 at 18 mln bags, of\nwhich 5.0 mln have already been sold for export. The harvest\nthis year should be around 30 mln bags, he added.\n    The latest Brazilian Coffee Institute estimate for last\nyear's harvest is 11.2 mln bags, although many traders believe\nit was higher than this.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
