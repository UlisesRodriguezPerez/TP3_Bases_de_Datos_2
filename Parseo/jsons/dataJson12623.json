        "BODY": "U.S. Trade Representative Clayton\nYeutter said a possible recession in western Europe or Japan\nwas possible as a result of the U.S. dollar's decline and the\nresulting drop in the U.S. trade deficit.\n    Yeutter told the Senate Finance Committee, \"They certainly\nhave the macroeconomic policy tools to adjust\" to the U.S.\nreduction in imports.\n    Asked if the U.S. trade deficit was preventing them from\ngoing into a recession, Yeutter replied that result was\n\"certainly possible\" and was the reason why they should adjust\ntheir monetary, fiscal and tax policies.\n    Asked by Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) whether the U.S. trade\ndeficit would improve more if the value of the dollar dropped\nfurther, Yeutter replied, \"That should be a mathematical truism.\"\nBut he added that markets are more complicated than that.\n    He said he expected the current decline in the dollar to\nshow up soon in the decline in the value of imports.\n    He expected the U.S. would soon start importing less from\nJapan and Europe and would start exporting more to Europe where\nthere's less rigidity on imports.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
