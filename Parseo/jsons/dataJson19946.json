        "DATELINE": "    RICHMOND, Va., June 29 - ",
        "BODY": "A.H. Robins Co said its board\nhas concluded that the merger proposal submitted by Rorer Group\nInc <ROR> merits further consideration.\n    At the request of the board, Rorer has agreed to extend\nuntil 1800 EDT July 2 its deadline for response from A.H.\nRobins.\n    After Rorer announced its second bid for the company last\nThursday, analysts forecast that the Robins family, which holds\ncontrol of the company, would vigourously oppose any merger.\n    But, the analysts added, that Robins desire to emerge\nindependent from two years of bankruptcy proceedings may be\nthwarted by some Robins' shareholders who perceive a merger as\na more expedient way of dealing with the company's Dalkon\nShield related liabilities.\n    After a failed first attempt earlier this year, Rorer's\nlatest merger plan calls for a share swap worth about 720 mln\ndlrs.\n    Rorer would also set up two trusts to cover the estimated\n1.75 billion dlrs in liabilities to deal with about 320,000\nclaims by women who suffered maladies from the use of the\nDalkon Shield interuterine device.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
