        "BODY": "Emhart Corp said it plans to increase\nworldwide revenues and earnings at an annual compounded growth\nrate of 15 pct and about 13 pct, respectively.\n    It said these objectives were based on several assumptions,\nincluding a four pct average inflation rate through 1989 and a\ntwo pct to three pct GNP real growth.\n    In 1986, Emhart reported a net loss of 10 mln dlrs or 35\ncts a share, after a 90 mln after-tax restructuring charge,\nwhich realigned the company's assets.\n    Emhart has divested itself of many of its units to focus on\nthree primary markets--industrial products, consumer products,\nand information and electronic systems.\n    Emhart said industrial products should account for about 62\npct of projected 1987 revenues of 2.3 billion dlrs, while\nconsumer products should account for about 20 pct of those\nrevenues and information and electronic systems about 18 pct.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
