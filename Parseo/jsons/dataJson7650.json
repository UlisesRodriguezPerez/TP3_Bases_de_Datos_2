        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, March 20 - ",
        "BODY": "Trans World Airlines Inc said it\nreached an agreement yesterday in federal court with USAir\nGroup Inc that prevents TWA from buying additional shares of\nUSAir.\n    Under the agreement, TWA, which holds about 15 pct of USAir\nstock, will not buy more USAir shares before April 23 and will\nnot do so after that date without giving 14 days notice to\nUSAir.\n    TWA also agreed that it would not knowingly and willingly\ninterfere with the consummation of the merger between USAir and\nPiedmont Aviation Inc <PIE>.\n    TWA said the court agreement confirms previous\nannouncements by the company, in filings with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission, that it does not presently intend to\nseek control of USAir or to acquire additional common stock.\n    As a result of the agreement, the court removed a previous\ntemporary restraining order against TWA, the company said.\n    TWA and USAir have also agreed that all litigation between\nthem in Pittsburgh and Delaware will be stayed until April 23.\nTWA said the agreement does not prevent it from commenting to\nregulatory agencies on the USAir, Piedmont merger.\n    In a separate statement, USAir said the agreement also\nincluded a provision that all USAir shares currently owned by\nTWA and its chairman, Carl Icahn, will be voted through a\nvoting trust in proportion to the votes of other shares not\ncontrolled by TWA or Icahn.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
