        "BODY": "The Federal Reserve appears to have\nintervened in the U.S. foreign exchange market to buy dollars\nagainst yen this morning, currency dealers said.\n    They said the intervention occurred near the dollar's early\nlow of 148.50 yen and the U.S. currency subsequently firmed to\n149.05/15. It closed at 150.00/05 on Monday.\n    Dealers were uncertain of the amount involved and whether\nthe Fed's purchases were for its own account or for a customer.\nBut there was speculation that it may have been done in\nconjunction with the Bank of Japan.
