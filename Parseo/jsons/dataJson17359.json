        "TITLE": "DECLINE IN U.S. DOLLAR MAY BOOST OPEC OIL PRICE",
        "AUTHOR": "     By JULIE VORMAN, Reuters",
        "DATELINE": "     HOUSTON, April 28 - ",
        "BODY": "The sliding value of the U.S. dollar\nmay soon force the Organization of Petroleum Exporting\nCountries to raise its oil benchmark price, setting the stage\nfor prices as high as 22 dlrs a barrel by yearend, top\nexecutives with U.S. oil companies said.\n    The current benchmark price of 18 dlrs a barrel was\nestablished by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting\nCountries (OPEC) at its December meeting when the cartel set a\n15.8 mln barrel per day production ceiling.\n    But the continuing weakness of the U.S. dollar, the\ncurrency used by OPEC for its oil sales, is making the 18 dlr\nprice difficult to sustain, said Fred Hartley, chairman of\nUnocal Corp <UCL>.\n    The U.S. dollar has fallen in value by about 10 pct since\nDecember and has fallen by a total of about 40 pct during the\npast two years.\n    Hartley told Reuters he expected significantly higher oil\nprices this winter and would not rule out the potential for 25\ndlrs a barrel by the spring of 1988.\n    \"I think June will be the critical month to see what they\ndo,\" said Hartley, who was in Houston to attend the World\nPetroleum Congress. OPEC has scheduled a regular meeting in\nJune which some experts believe is likely to revive suggestions\nthat oil should be priced according to a basket of world\ncurrencies instead of the U.S. dollar.\n    E.H. Clark, chairman of <Baker Hughes Inc>, said the Saudi\nkingdom's need to generate revenues -- rather than greater\nworld demand -- would drive any price increases.\n    \"The Saudis have made committments and have a balance of\ntrade based on receiving 18 dlrs a barrel for this oil. But the\nU.S. dollar won't buy as much as it did five or six months\nago,\" Clark said in an interview. \"I'm betting on the Saudi\nking's need to sustain revenues.\"\n    Clark predicted that world oil prices would top 22 dlrs a\nbarrel by January one.\n    However, the authoritative Middle East Economic Survey\nreported yesterday that Saudi Arabia would not seek to increase\nOPEC oil prices unless oil demand showed strong growth.\n    Saudi sources told the newsletter that the policy was based\non the longterm need to restore the competitive position of\nOPEC oil against other energy sources.\n    Many oil industry experts are forecasting a modest increase\nin world oil demand averaging one pct annually during the next\nfew years.\n    Michel Moreau, a director of the <Elf Aquitaine Group>,\nsaid he believed the worldwide oil industry had reached a\nconsensus that prices of at least 20 dlrs a barrel were\nnecessary to cover exploration costs, royalties and taxes on\nnew production.\n    The 20 dlr level will be reached this year only if the\ncash-strapped nations of Nigeria, Egypt and Gabon refrain from\ndiscounting oil prices or increasing production levels, Moreau\nsaid.\n    \"I think if more than two (OPEC nations) defect, the\nproduction agreement will fall apart,\" he said. \"But this\nthreat is the Saudis' big stick to keep producers in line.\nNobody wants a repeat of the collapse that occurred in 1986.\"\n    Lawrence Rawl, chairman of Exxon Corp <XON>, told Reuters\nhe expected prices would remain at 18 dlrs through the end of\n1987, adding that 20 dlrs a barrel was a possibility.\n    Other major companies are taking a more cautious view of\nprices, fearing that some OPEC members may yet upset the\ncartel's production agreement.\n    \"This is a year of testing,\" said Alfred Munk, manager of\nforeign affairs at Amoco Corp. (AN). \"If they fail, there may\nbe a price decline to about 14 dlrs a barrel.\"\n    French-owned Total CFP's vice president Pierre Vaillaud\nsaid, \"Demand is not going up very quickly, at best maybe one\npercent a year. You can't change the price with just one pct,\"\nVaillaud said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
