        "BODY": "Australian Treasurer Paul Keating said\nhe expects the country's 1986/87 current account deficit to be\none billion dlrs lower than the 14.7 billion forecast in the\nAugust budget. Keating told a financiers' dinner that\nFebruary's 750 mln dlr deficit, against January's 1.23 billion,\nwas \"in the groove\" of the government's expectations.\n    \"We will probably bring the current account this year under\n14 billion, I think, which will probably be about a billion\ndollars less than we forecast in the budget,\" Keating said. \"I am\nsure we will see a lower current account deficit for next year\n... And a fall as proportion of GDP.\"\n    Australia posted a 13.82 billion dlr current account\ndeficit in 1985/86 and Keating said the latest monthly figures\nshowed an encouraging trend.\n    Keating said the government would maintain responsible\neconomic management regardless of whether it was drawn into an\nelection, because it would take time to stabilise Australia's\n80 billion dlr foreign debt.\n    \"We have to build the import competing sector back,\" he said.\n\"We are now trying to rebuild our capital structure. We are\ntrying to rebuild the culture of productivity and\nmanufacturing.\"\n    Keating said the foundation for a transition of the economy\nhad been laid with the floating of the Australian dollar and\ncontinued with wage restraint and deregulation.\n    The Government would follow with spending cuts in its\neconomic statement on May 14, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
