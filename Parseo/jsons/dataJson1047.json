        "BODY": "Pharmacia AB <PHAB ST> forecast\nearnings after financial items of one billion crowns in 1987 vs\n821.2 mln last year on condition that exchange rates remained\nat their present parities.\n    Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion\ncrowns from 3.65 billion in 1986, it said.\n    A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct\nnegative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed\non currency movements.\n    Last year's results were also badly hit by a once-off\nwritedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets.\n    The company said mainly this represented the premium the\ngroup had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms it\nhad taken over.\n    The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87\nbillion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly\nby drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and\npartly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln.\n    Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it\nhaving used more funds than generated by group operations,\nmainly because of the 1.36 billion it paid in cash for shares\nin LKB-Produkter AB and the assets of Intermedics-Intraocular\nInc.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
