        "BODY": "French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur\nissued a firm call for the continued faithful application of\nthe Louvre accords on currency stability by all major\nindustrial countries.\n    Balladur, responding to weekend remarks by U.S. Treasury\nSecretary James Baker that the U.S. Would take another look at\nthe accords, said \"I firmly desire a faithfull and firm\nadherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre\naccords -- in both their letter and spirit.\"\n    On Sunday, Baker said last week's rise in short-term West\nGerman interest rates was not in keeping with the accords.\n    The Louvre accords, agreed in Paris last February, called\nfor stability among the major currencies after a prolonged\ndollar slide.\n    The accords were reaffirmed by the Group of Seven Finance\nMinisters in Washington last month.\n    But Baker said at the weekend that the West German rate\nrise was \"not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to.\"\n    \"What I'm really saying is that they should not expect us to\nsimply sit back here and accept increased tightening on their\npart on the assumption that somehow we are going to follow\nthem,\" he added.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
