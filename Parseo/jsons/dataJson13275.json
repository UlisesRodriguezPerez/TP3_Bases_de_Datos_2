        "BODY": "An extension of the International Tin\nAgreement (ITA) is unrealistic and the pact should be allowed\nto lapse, Indonesian Mines and Energy Minister Subroto told\nreporters.\n    Asked about Jakarta's position for the quarterly session of\nthe International Tin Council on April 8-9, Subroto said\nIndonesia had agreed to the formation of a study group to look\ninto how to replace the pact.\n    But he said that given the present disagreement between\nproducers and consumers, there is unlikely to be any follow-up\nto the ITA.\n    Asked by reporters if Indonesia would support an extension\nof the ITA, he said, \"No one will propose that. It's also\nunrealistic to do so.\"\n    Subroto played a key part in securing agreement between the\nseven member Association of Tin Producing Countries to\nintroduce a quota system which limited their exports and\nconsumption to 96,000 tonnes in the year starting March 1.\n    Indonesia's quota was set at 24,516 tonnes.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
