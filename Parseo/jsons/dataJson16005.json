        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, April 9 - ",
        "BODY": "Crude oil netback values in complex\nrefineries rose sharply in Europe and firmed in the U.S. last\nFriday from the previous week but fell sharply in Singapore,\naccording to calculations by Reuters Pipeline.\n    The firmer tone to refining margins in Europe and the U.S.\nrelected higher prices for petroleum products, particularly\ngasoline, and support from crude oil prices.\n    Netback values for crude oil refined in Northern Europe\nrose substantially following strong gains in gasoline prices\nthere. Brent is valued at 19.45 dlrs, up 56 cts a barrel or\nthree pct from the previous week.\n    In the U.S. Gulf, sweet crudes rose in value by 14 cts to\n19.33 dlrs for West Texas Intermediate, up about 0.7 pct.\n    Sour grades in the U.S. Gulf showed an increase of 33 cts a\nbarrel for Alaska North Slope, up 1.7 pct.\n    But netbacks for crude oil refined in Singapore fell\nsharply, down 15 cts to as much as 68 cts a barrel as ample\ndistillate supplies weighed on petroleum product prices.\n    Attaka in Singapore is valued at 18.55 dlrs, a decline of\n68 cts a barrel or 3.5 pct from the previous week.\n    For refineries in the Mediterranean, netback values were\nmostly lower, with declines of seven to 14 cts. The value of\nKuwait crude fell 14 cts to 18.37 dlrs, while Iranian Light\nfell 11 cts to 19.14 dlrs.\n    On the U.S. West Coast, netback values for ANS CIF L.A.\nalso jumped sharply, up 40 cts a barrel or 2.2 pct to 18.82\ndlrs on higher gasoline prices.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
