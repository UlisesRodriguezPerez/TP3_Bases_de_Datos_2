        "BODY": "A bidding war for Viacom International\nInc, one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies, pitted a\nmanagement group and other investors against National\nAmusements Inc, a closely held theater operator.\n    Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A source\nclose to the management side insisted that timing was on his\nside. He said if outside directors approve the management\nproposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders\nwith proxy material going out late this week. \"It would take 20\ndays from the day we mail,\" said the source.\n    The source predicted National Amusements, controlled by\ninvestor Sumner Redstone, would need \"half a year\" to complete\na tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must\naccompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licenses\nand cable television franchises.\n    Redstone was not available for comment.\n    Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a rare\nsituation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One\nsaid Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and\nif enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to\nthe Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win.\n    The independent directors of Viacom were called into a\nmeeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow.\n    Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One\nmajor Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. \"We think\nwe're at the end now, in terms of bidding,\" said the firm's\narbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified.\n    Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal would\ncreate a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The\nmanagement plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5\nbillion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred\nstock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock.\n    Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash,\na fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a\nvalue of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock\nstock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity\ninterest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated\nthe equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the\ntotal package worth 52 dlrs per share.\n    Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable\npreferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of\nconvertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion\nwas worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs.\n    Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he\nwould pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond\nApril 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The\nplan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct\nduring May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered\neight pct interest.\n    Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management\ngroup, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes,\nwere offering high prices. \"Redstone really wants to own the\ncompany,\" one said. Another said management seemed to have the\nedge on the timing issue.\n    Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares.\n    A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what\nthe equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He\nnoted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp <FMC>, which\nadopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally\ntraded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now\njust over 30 dlrs.\n    Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two\ntwo cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costs\nfrom several acquisitions affected results.\n    Shares of Warner Communications Inc <WCI> rose 7/8 to\n31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25\nmln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at\n37.50 dlrs.\n    Chris Craft Industries <CCN>, which owns a stake in Warner,\nrose 1-1/4 to 22-3/4.\n    Viacom was created in 1970 and spun off from CBS Inc <CBS>.\nThe company has 940,000 cable television subscribers, operates\nnine satellite television services and owns television and\nradio stations. It is one of the largest distributors of films\nand other programs for television.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
