        "BODY": "Venezuela has still to work out final\ndetails of its plan to supply Ecuador with 50,000 barrels per\nday of crude oil to compensate that country for lost exports\ncaused by earthquake damage, a senior Petroleos de Venezuela\n(PDVSA) official said.\n    \"We have yet to finalize details on how the compensation\nwill be carried out and how OPEC production quotas will be\naffected,\" he said during the signing of a joint venture deal\nwith Union Pacific Corp today.\n    He said an agreement was initialled on a visit last week by\nEcuador's deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite.\n    He pointed out that there are some contractual points to be\nconsidered. Venezuela, possibly unique among oil exporters,\nrequires its clients to sign final destination clauses to\nensure its oil is not resold on the spot market.\n    Ecuador's oil minister Javier Espinosa was quoted today as\nsaying Venezuela will export the oil on Ecuador's account and\nremit the revenues to Quito. Ecuador would pay back the oil at\na rate of 35,000 bpd.\n    He said Venezuela's oil would be traded through Ecuadorean\nstate oil company Cepe, but the PDVSA official said the company\nnever allows third parties to trade its oil.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
