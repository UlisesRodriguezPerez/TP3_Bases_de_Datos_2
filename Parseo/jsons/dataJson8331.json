Operation of the plant, to be jointly\nowned by Amselco and Nerco, is set to start in October.\n    The Alligator Ridge Mine is jointly owned by Amselco and\nNerco, a unit of Nerco Inc <NER>, which is 90.5 pct owned by\nPacificorp <PPW>, a Portland, Ore., holding company.\n    The mine has produced about 60,000 ounces of gold a year\nsince 1981 using another leaching process, a BP spokesman said.\nThe open pit oxide ore reserves of Alligator Ridge will be\nexhausted by August 1987, as expected, when the work force will\nbe reduced to about 72 from 127, the company said.\n    The employees remaining after that will operate the new\nplant, it said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
