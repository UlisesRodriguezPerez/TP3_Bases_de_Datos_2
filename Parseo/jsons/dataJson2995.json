        "BODY": "The value of China's industrial output in\nJanuary and February this year was 14.1 pct higher than in the\nsame 1986 period, the New China News Agency said.\n    Output increased by 5.6 pct from January 1985 to January\n1986 and 0.9 pct from February 1985 to 1986.\n    The agency said the most recent increase was largely due to\nlast year's poor performance. \"No significant improvement was\nmade in economic results,\" it said, adding that some successes\nwere reported in readjusting the industrial product mix in the\nlast quarter of 1986.\n    The agency said the amount of tied up working capital rose\nand sizeable funds were occupied by unsaleable goods in 1986.\n    It quoted unnamed economists as saying they expect 1987\nindustrial production to increase at a proper rate and with\nbetter results, due to a cost-efficiency drive underway\nthroughout the country. It gave no more details.\n    The official industrial growth target this year is seven\npct, down from an actual 9.2 pct last year.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
