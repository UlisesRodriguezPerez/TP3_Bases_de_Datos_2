        "BODY": "U.S. personal income rose 0.2 pct,\nor 5.4 billion dlrs, in March to a seasonally adjusted annual\nrate of 3,603.9 billion dlrs, the Commerce Department said.\n    The increase followed an upwardly revised 1.3 pct rise in\nFebruary. Earlier, the department said income rose 0.9 pct in\nFebruary.\n    Personal consumption expenditures rose 0.3 pct, or 8.9\nbillion dlrs, to 2,882.6 billion dlrs in March after rising a\nrevised 2.4 pct in February instead of the previously reported\n1.7 pct rise, the department said.\n    Last month's income gain matched a 0.2 pct rise in November\nand was the lowest since June when income was unchanged. The\nspending rise was the weakest since January's 2.0 pct decline.\n    The department said the slowdown in income was mainly due\nto a drop in subsidies to farmers. Excluding that factor,\npersonal income rose 0.4 pct in March and 0.7 pct in February.\n    Wages and salaries rose 7.4 billion dlrs last month after\ngaining 16.6 billion dlrs in February, while manufacturing\npayrolls declined 1.3 billion dlrs after rising 2.5 billion\ndlrs in February.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
