        "BODY": "The placement of the German federal\ngovernment's 25.6 pct stake in utility Veba AG <VEBG.F> would\nprobably take place early next week, banking sources said.\n    Share dealers said speculation had arisen in the early\npre-bourse market that the Veba announcement could come as\nearly as today. But one banking source, though confirming that\nmost of the details had been worked out, said the chances of an\nannouncement today were about nil. He had no price details.\n    The 10 mln shares on offer are expected to bring a cash\ncall in Germany for well over two billion marks. The share was\naround 253 marks today after a 6.50 drop to 252 yesterday.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
