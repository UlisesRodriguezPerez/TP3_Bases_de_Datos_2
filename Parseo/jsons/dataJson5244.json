        "BODY": "OPEC produced only about 14 mln bpd of\noil in the second week of March -- 1.8 mln bpd below its\nceiling -- largely because of pipeline problems in Turkey and\nEcuador, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) estimated.\n    A landslide breached Iraq's one mln bpd pipeline through\nTurkey on March 6 for a week, and earthquakes in Ecuador have\nshut down its export pipeline for four to five months. Ecuador\nhas an OPEC quota of 210,000 bpd.\n    MEES put Saudi Arabian output at 2.9 mln bpd in the first\nweek of March and 3.1 mln bpd in the second, in addition to\noutput from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.\n    MEES said Saudi Arabia was pumping more than 300,000 bpd of\nits total production into floating storage.\n    Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters and the\ntelevision news agency Visnews yesterday that Saudi output,\nincluding Neutral Zone production, was around three mln bpd.\n    The Cyprus-based newsletter also said authoritative Libyan\noil sources said Libya was producing 850,000 bpd, compared with\nits 948,000 bpd quota, and that actual liftings are much lower\nthan that.\n    It said one major Libyan equity producer had partially\nstopped lifting its 55,000 bpd equity entitlement for March\nbecause Libya was insisting on official prices, but is still\nlifting 40,000 bpd of debt crude at official prices and a\nfurther 25,000 bpd of \"purchase crude.\"\n    It said small equity producers, with entitlements of only\n2,000 to 3,000 bpd, had also told Tripoli they could not lift\nat official prices.\n    MEES said Iraq had sent a telex to OPEC and member\ncountries calling for the formation of a committee to study\nwhat it said were inequalities in marketing potential among\nvarious members.\n    The newsletter said the Iraqi letter indicated Baghdad was\nhaving difficulty selling crude at official prices.\n    The Iraqi telex pointed out that some member countries\nexport substantial volumes of oil that are not subject to OPEC\nprice regulations -- exports of refined products, equity crude\non which the margins are equivalent to covert discounts and\n\"other forms of hydrocarbons\" which are marketed in package deals\nwith crude oil.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
