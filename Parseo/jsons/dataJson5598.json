        "BODY": "The International Cocoa Organization,\nICCO, council adjourned after presenting divergent producer and\nconsumer views on buffer stock rules and agreeing to examine a\ndraft compromise proposal on the buffer stock issue tomorrow,\ndelegates said.\n    ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn will draw up what\nsome delegates called a \"pre-compromise\" and present it to the\nbuffer stock working group at 1130 hrs GMT Tuesday, they said.\n    While consumer and producer member nations disagree how a\nbuffer stock should be implemented, both sides reiterated they\nwere willing to compromise to come to agreement, they said.\n    \"I am optimistic we will be able to come to an agreement --\nmaybe not tomorrow or the next day, but some time later in the\nsession,\" a consumer delegate said.\n    Producers say they want the buffer stock to consist only of\nICCO member cocoa, comprise a representative basket of various\ngrade cocoas and pay different prices for different grades,\ndelegates said.\n    Some consumers would rather the buffer stock manager be\nable to buy non-member cocoa also, and pay a single price for\nthe buffer stock cocoa without respect to origin.\n    Consumer members were not unified in their views on how the\nbuffer stock should operate, with several countries backing\ndifferent aspects of the producer stance, delegates said.\n    The semi-annual council meeting is scheduled to run until\nMarch 27. Consideration of the buffer stock rules is the most\ncontroversial topic on the agenda, delegates said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
