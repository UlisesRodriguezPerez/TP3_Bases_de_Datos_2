        "BODY": "Commerce Dept. undersecretary of\neconomic affairs Robert Ortner said that he believed the dollar\nat  current levels was fairly priced against most European\ncurrencies.\n    In a wide ranging address sponsored by the Export-Import\nBank, Ortner, the bank's senior economist also said he believed\nthat the yen was undervalued and could go up by 10 or 15 pct.\n    \"I do not regard the dollar as undervalued at this point\nagainst the yen,\" he said.\n    On the other hand, Ortner said that he thought that \"the yen\nis still a little bit undervalued,\" and \"could go up another 10\nor 15 pct.\"\n    In addition, Ortner, who said he was speaking personally,\nsaid he thought that the dollar against most European\ncurrencies was \"fairly priced.\"\n    Ortner said his analysis of the various exchange rate\nvalues was based on such economic particulars as wage rate\ndifferentiations.\n    Ortner said there had been little impact on U.S. trade\ndeficit by the decline of the dollar because at the time of the\nPlaza Accord, the dollar was extremely overvalued and that the\nfirst 15 pct decline had little impact.\n    He said there were indications now that the trade deficit\nwas beginning to level off.\n    Turning to Brazil and Mexico, Ortner made it clear that it\nwould be almost impossible for those countries to earn enough\nforeign exchange to pay the service on their debts.  He said\nthe best way to deal with this was to use the policies outlined\nin Treasury Secretary James Baker's debt initiative.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
