        "BODY": "A Mannesmann AG <MMWG.F> spokesman\nsaid the company has lodged an application with the Federal\nCartel Office for approval of a possible majority stake in car\nparts company <Fichtel und Sachs AG>.\n    He described the application as a precautionary move and\nsaid no agreement on buying a majority stake had yet been\nreached. Until now Mannesmann has said only that it wanted to\nbuy a 37.5 pct stake in Fichtel from the heirs of Ernst Wilhelm\nSachs, the grandson of the firm's founder.\n    The spokesman declined to say from whom it may buy the\nother shares to create a majority stake in the firm.\n    Fichtel's other principal shareholders are Commerzbank AG\n<CBKG.F>, with 35.01 pct, and Salzgitter AG <ISLG.F>, with\n24.98 pct. Spokesmen declined to comment directly on the\npossibility of selling Fichtel shares to Mannesmann.\n    Mannesmann said in January it hoped to take a 37.5 pct\nstake in Fichtel's holding company Sachs AG in the first\nquarter.\n    Last week a spokesman said Mannesmann had a letter of\nintent on the 37.5 pct stake but completion was being delayed\nby legal questions surrounding the inheritance.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
