        "BODY": "Dutch Social Affairs Minister Louw de\nGraaf announced he is withdrawing the annual 10 mln guilder\nlabour subsidy for Rotterdam's strike-hit general cargo sector\nas from July 1.\n    Late last month de Graaf said that if the dispute was not\nsettled by Monday this week he would withdraw the subsidy.\n    The chairman of the port employers' organization, SVZ,\nJacques Schoufour, said he was unhappy with the decision and\nadded there was now no alternative to proceeding with\nredundancy plans.\n    The series of strikes in the sector started on January 19\nin protest at employers' plans to make 800 redundancies from\nthe 4,000-strong workforce by 1990 starting with 350 this year.\n    Meanwhile, the port and transport union, FNV, attacked loss\nfigures given for the port for this year.\n    The figures, issued by accountants on behalf of the SVZ,\nput total losses for last year at 34 mln guilders and in 1985\nat 37 mln. Earlier, the employers had put the figure at around\n30 mln.\n    The FNV said the actual losses were nearer 17 to 20 mln and\nsaid the employers had inflated the figures as part of their\nplan to restructure completely the port's general cargo sector.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
