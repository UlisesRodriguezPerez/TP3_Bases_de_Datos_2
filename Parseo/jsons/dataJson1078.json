        "BODY": "The Federal Reserve is expected to\nenter the U.S. Government securities market to add temporary\nreserves, economists said.\n    They expect it to supply the reserves indirectly by\narranging 1.5 to two billion dlrs of customer repurchase\nagreements. The Fed may add the reserves directly instead via\nSystem repurchases.\n    Federal funds, which averaged 6.18 pct yesterday, opened at\n6-3/16 pct and stayed there in early trading. Analysts said the\nrate is under upward pressure partly from settlement of 8.25\nbillion dlrs of five-year Treasury notes.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
