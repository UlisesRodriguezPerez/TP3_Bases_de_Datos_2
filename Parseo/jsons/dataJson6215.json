Heinz Co is \"within sight of our\n22nd consecutive year of new records in financial growth\" for\nthe fiscal year ending April 30, Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer Anthony O'Reilly told investment analysts.\n    O'Reilly, who declined to make a specific projection, said\nthe food company is \"stronger than at any time in its 118-year\nhistory.\"\n    Last week Heinz reported third-quarter earnings rose to 55\ncts a share from 46 cts a share. Sales rose to 1.08 billion\ndlrs from 1.01 billion dlrs a year earlier.\n    O'Reilly said Heinz will concentrate on backing its big\nbrands, new products and services, new geography, internal\ngrowth and acquisitions.\n    He said Heinz Ketchup has its highest market share in\nhistory, 55 pct. But in response to a question, the executive\nsaid a volume falloff in the overall product category \"is a\nconcern to us.\"\n    O'Reilly said Weight Watchers continues to perform well and\nwill generate revenue in fiscal 1987 of approximately 940 mln\ndlrs.\n    O'Reilly told analysts Heinz is in active negotiations to\nbuild a second plant in China, where it entered a joint venture\nwith the government in 1984, forming Heinz-UFE Ltd, which\nproduces dry baby food cereal.\n    He said Heinz-Japan is \"making a profit and generating its\nfirst substantial dividends,\" and implementation of a new\npartnership, Seoul-Heinz Ltd, is moving ahead with a new\nmanufacturing plant targeted for completion by June in Seoul,\nSouth Korea.\n    To increase its competitiveness, O'Reilly said Heinz\nimplemented a \"lowest cost imaginable\" program targeted at\nmanufacturing, sales and marketing and procurement.\n    He said a modernization program is in effect at the\ncompany's United Kingdom operations, where the labor force,\ntrimmed to 4,000 from 10,000, is expected to be further reduced\nto 2,500 in 1988.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
