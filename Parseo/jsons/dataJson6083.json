        "BODY": "Zambia will reintroduce a modified\nforeign exchange auction at the end of this month as part of a\nnew two-tier exchange rate, central bank governor Leonard\nChivuno said.\n    Chivuno told a press conference at the end of three weeks\nof negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that\nthere would be a fixed exchange rate for official transactions\nand a fluctuating rate, decided by the auction, for other types\nof business.\n    The Bank of Zambia previously held weekly auctions to\ndistribute foreign exchange to the private sector and determine\nthe kwacha's exchange rate, but these were suspended at the end\nof January.\n    President Kenneth Kaunda said at the time that he was\nsuspending the auction system in view of the rapid devaluation\nand violent fluctations of the exchange rate which had\nresulted.\n    Business and banking sources said another reason for\nsuspending the auction was that the central bank was low on\nforeign exchange and was 10 weeks behind in paying successful\nbidders.    The kwacha stood at 2.2 per dollar when the auction system\nwas first introduced in October 1985, but it slid to around 15\nper dollar by the time it was suspended 16 months later.\n    Since then, Zambia has operated a fixed exchange rate of\nabout nine kwacha per dollar.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
