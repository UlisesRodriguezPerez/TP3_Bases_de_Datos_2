        "DATELINE": "    LONDON, March 26 - ",
        "BODY": "Aluminium scrap recovery and usage and\noutput of secondary metal will continue to rise, said Shearson\nLehman Brothers in a review of the secondary aluminium market\nwhich details cost and demand factors.\n    Although primary smelting costs have declined generally in\nrecent years, the still substantial energy cost savings offered\nby secondary smelters will continue to make re-melted material\nincreasingly attractive.\n    It takes around 15,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricity\nto produce one tonne of primary aluminium compared with around\n550 kwh for one tonne of secondary metal, Shearson said.\n    On the demand side, developments in automobiles and\npackaging bode well for secondary aluminium consumption.\n    Automobile production, although expected to fall this year,\nis still on an upward trend and will continue to be so for the\nforeseeable future and, in addition, use of aluminium castings\nis gaining wider acceptance in the automobile industry,\nparticularly in the U.S.\n    In packaging, Shearson does not expect aluminium to\ndominate the beverage can market in any of the other major\neconomies to the extent it does in the U.S., But says there is\nevidence recycling is on the increase in other countries.\n    In addition to the cost savings involved, technology\nadvances now enable alloys of higher purity to be produced by\nthe secondary aluminium industry, Shearson said.\n    There is not likely to be a problem of availability as the\nU.S. Has a huge scrap reservoir and this is also true of\nseveral European countries, albeit on a smaller scale.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
