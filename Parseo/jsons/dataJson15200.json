Greece has\nrepeatedly said the issue was legal and could be solved at the\nInternational Court of Justice.\n    The two countries approached armed confrontation last month\nafter Greece announced it planned oil exploration work in the\nAegean and Turkey said it would also search for oil.\n    A face-off was averted when Turkey confined its research to\nterritorrial waters. \"The latest crises created an historic\nopportunity to solve the disputes between the two countries,\"\nthe Foreign Ministry statement said.\n    Turkey's ambassador in Athens, Nazmi Akiman, was due to\nmeet Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou today for the Greek\nreply to a message sent last week by Turkish Prime Minister\nTurgut Ozal.
