        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 24 - ",
        "BODY": "Leading U.S. farm state senators are\nseeking to insert into the Senate's omnibus trade bill a\nprovision that would broaden eligibility requirements under the\nU.S. Agriculture Department's export enhancement program, EEP,\nto include traditional buyers of U.S. farm products, including\nthe Soviet Union, Senate staff said.\n    Under existing criteria, USDA can offer EEP subsidies to\nrecoup export markets lost to competing nations' unfair trading\npractices.\n    Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)\nis leading a group of farm state senators in an effort to\nbroaden the criteria in such a way as to enable Moscow to be\neligible for the subsidies, sources said.\n    The senators -- including Senate Finance Committee Chairman\nLloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), Max Baucus (D-Mont.), David Pryor\n(D-Ark.), John Melcher (D-Mont.) and Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) --\nalso may fold into the trade bill a measure to shield pork\nproducers and processors from Canadian imports.\n    The measure, sponsored by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa),\nwould clarify the definition of \"industry\" in determining whether\nor not imports were causing injury to U.S. producers.\n    Grassley's bill stems from a 1985 decision by the\nInternational Trade Commission that imports from Canada of live\nswine -- but not fresh, chilled and frozen pork -- were harming\nU.S. producers.\n    The bill's proponents have argued Canada has simply\nreplaced shipments of live hogs with fresh pork.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
