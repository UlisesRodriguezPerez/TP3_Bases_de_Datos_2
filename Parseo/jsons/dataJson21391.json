        "BODY": "Australian Minister for Trade\nNegotiations Michael Duffy said his country and Third World\ncommodity producers have formed an effective lobby group\nagainst farm export subsidies and market access restrictions.\n    Duffy told a press conference the Cairns Group of 14 major\nagricultural producers, to which Australia and Thailand belong,\nhas emerged as an important third force in any multilateral\ntrade talks. \"There's no doubt that the Cairns Group is being\nseen as a third force to be reckoned with both inside the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and in other\ninternational trade negotiations,\" he said.\n    Duffy, here on a three-day visit after talks in the United\nStates, The European Community (EC) and Latin America, said\nconsiderable progress has been made by the group towards\nfighting costly protectionist policies pursued by developed\ncountries.\n    The minister said the EC Commission's new farm trade paper\nwill recognise the heavy financial burdens imposed by its\nCommon Agricultural Policy and its future expansion.\n    He said the Reagan Administration has also displayed a\ndetermination to resist the currently strong protectionist\nsentiment in the U.S. Congress.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
