        "BODY": "Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will\nvisit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting U.S.\nAnger over Japanese trade policies, but Western diplomats said\nthey believed his chances of success were slim.\n    Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and\nwidespread opposition to his tax reform plans, Nakasone will be\nhard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S.\nPresident Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen, they said.\n    News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincided\nwith news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surplus\nlast month, more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier.\n    It also came one day after the Reagan Administration's\nEconomic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory action\nagainst Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint\ntrade agreement on computer microchips.\n    Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - one\ndesigned to pep up Japan's sagging economy and imports in the\nshort-term, the other to redirect the country in the medium\nterm away from its over-dependence on exports for growth.\n    But government officials said political infighting could\nrob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent\none from seeing the light of day.\n    Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up\na package of short-term economic measures until after its\n1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would\namount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate.\n    But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for\nhis trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by\nopposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan.\n    Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the\nU.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his ruling\nLiberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its own\nmeasures.\n    He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basis\nof the government's plans, without losing face in parliament\nover the budget, political analysts said.\n    Officials working on the government's short-term economic\npackage said it would probably include interest rate cuts on\nloans by government corporations, deregulation, measures to\npass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in\nthe form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment.\n    They said a record portion of state investment planned for\nthe entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the first\nhalf, probably over 80 pct.\n    Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy\nReagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S.\nCongress to take greater action to cut the huge American trade\ndeficit.\n    To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is also\nlikely to present Reagan with details of Japan's longer-term\neconomic plans.\n    A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japan\ngovernor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a final\nreport outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days\nbefore Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington.\n    Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up to\nMaekawa's report last year on economic restructuring and are\nlikely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as\nagricultural reform and land policy, officials said.\n    While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed\nas possible, they said the political realities might force them\nto water down some of the committee's recommendations.\n    A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economy\nmight look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes\nmassive restructuring, officials said. The subcommittee\nprojects that the current account surplus will fall to less\nthan two pct of Japan's total output, or gross national\nproduct, around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus, which\nmeasures trade in goods and services, amounted to over four pct\nof gnp.\n    The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for\nJapan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual\nappreciation of the yen, to about 130 to the dollar by around\n1993, from 150 now.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
