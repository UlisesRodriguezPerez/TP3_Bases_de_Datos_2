        "DATELINE": "     BRUSSELS, April 9 - ",
        "BODY": "The European Community launched an\ninvestigation into allegations of dumping by Japanese\nsemiconductor makers in a move which diplomats said could mark\nan intensification of world trade strains.\n    Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washington\nfor the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it\nimports into the U.S.\n    The EC Executive Commission said today the European\nElectrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that\nJapanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable\nprogrammable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices.\n    Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM\nmarket, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had been\nforced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in\norder to compete with the Japanese.\n    The Commission said it believed the Association had given\nsufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an\ninvestigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it found\nthe complaints were justified.\n    The Commission claims last year's accord between the U.S.\nAnd Japan on microchip pricing gives U.S. Firms privileged\naccess to the Japanese market.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
