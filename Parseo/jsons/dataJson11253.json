        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, March 31 - ",
        "BODY": "General Acquisition Co said it was\ndisappointed by Gencorp's response to its tender offer and\nasked how the company might give better value to shareholders.\n    Gencorp had earlier urged shareholders to reject a 100 dlr\nper share tender offer from General Acquisition, an affiliate\nof Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries Inc, and said it was\nstudying financially superior alternatives.\n    The General Acquisition partnership called the response\ninflammatory and unproductive, particularly since it had tried\nto discuss the offer with Gencorp.\n    The partnership said Gencorp failed to say how it would\nprovide a \"superior value yet they continue their attempt to\nprevent a satisfactory offer by failing to redeem their poison\npill.\" Poison pills are shareholder rights plans that make\ntakeovers more expensive.\n    Gencorp said in its statement earlier that it planned to\nput off the date its rights will trade separately from the\ncommon stock to April 6 from April 3. It said the extension was\nsubject to further extensions by the board and is conditional\non no person acquiring beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more\nof Gencorp before April 6.\n    General Acquisition said it is confident its offer can be\ncompleted in a timely manner using its financial arrangements.\n    The partnership in its statement again urged Gencorp\nmanagement to work with it to facilitate a transaction.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
