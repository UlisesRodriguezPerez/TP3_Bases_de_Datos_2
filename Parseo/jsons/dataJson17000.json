        "DATELINE": "    Toronto, April 21 - ",
        "BODY": "TransCanada PipeLines Ltd denied\nreports that it raised its offer for Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP>\nto 5.5 billion Canadian dlrs from 4.3 billion.\n    A report on the Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC) late last\nnight said TransCanada's new bid was rejected by Dome, which\nhas accepted a 5.1 billion dlr bid from Amoco Corp <AN>.\n    \"We still want to acquire Dome's assets and are prepared to\nnegotiate. However, we have not presented a new proposal to the\ncompany since April 16 and Dome has refused to negotiate with\nTransCanada since that date,\" said TransCanada president Gerald\nMaier.\n    TransCanada said its proposal consists of two parts -- 4.5\nbillion dlrs in cash and securities and one billion dlrs of\npayments to creditors based on future profits.\n    Last week, TransCanada valued the first part of its offer\nat 4.3 billion dlrs, but a spokesman today said the company\nincreased the estimated value of that part to 4.5 billion dlrs\nafter the recent gain in Dome's stock.\n    Dome was halted today on the Toronto Stock Exchange pending\nclarification of TransCanada's offer. It last traded at 1.70\ndlrs per share. Two weeks ago, before TransCanada's offer, Dome\ntraded at about 1.10 dlrs per share.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
