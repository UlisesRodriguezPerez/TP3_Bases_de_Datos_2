        "BODY": "The United States does not expect\nthe executive board meeting of the International Coffee\nOrganization, ICO, to call for a new round of negotiations on\nreinstating coffee quotas, a U.S. government official said.\n    The official, a member of the U.S. delegation to ICO talks\nearlier this year, said no new coffee agreement talks are\nexpected because there is no indication the negotiating\npositions of major producers and consumers have changed.\n    The U.S. still demands, as a condition of reimposition of\ncoffee quotas, that \"objective criteria\" be set for\nestablishing quotas, said the U.S. official, who asked not to\nbe identified. Brazil, the major producer, insists on quotas\nbased on a traditional formula.\n    The U.S. remains open to a negotiating meeting but only if\nsome new flexibility is apparent from major countries, the\nofficial said.\n    The ICO executive board meets tomorrow in London.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
