        "BODY": "The ruling GATT Council deferred a\ndecision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a\nEuropean Community complaint against the U.S.- Japanese\nagreement on exports of computer semiconductors.\n    David Woods, spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs\nand Trade (GATT), told a news briefing that the main parties\nwould continue bilateral talks. This was in the hope of\nresolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15.\n    The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect\nthe U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips,\nofficially known as semiconductors.\n    The E.C. Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules by\nallowing Tokyo to monitor prices, allowing it to set minimum\nprices for Japanese chips sold in third countries.\n    The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gave\nU.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market.\n    Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong, Canada, Switzerland,\nSingapore, Sweden, Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the EC\ncomplaint during the heated Council debate.\n    Japan's delegate, Minoru Endo, and U.S. Ambassador Michael\nSamuels replied in the debate that the E.C. Charges were\nunfounded, but they were willing to continue bilateral talks.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
