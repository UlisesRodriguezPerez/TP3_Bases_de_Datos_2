        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 12 - ",
        "BODY": "U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard\nLyng said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market\nto U.S. exporters when he visits that country next month.\n    In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also said the Reagan\nadministration will ask Tokyo to remove its quotas on U.S. beef\nand citrus exports.\n    Lyng, who plans to be in Japan April 14-27, said he will\nnot ask Tokyo to liberalize fully its rice market. \"We will urge\nthat they consider sharing their rice market,\" he said.\n    The USDA secretary would not say how big a share of the\nJapanese rice market the U.S. would request. \"We've got none of\nit now. If we got one per cent of it, it would be a big\nimprovement,\" he said.\n    Last year, the Reagan administration rejected a petition by\nthe U.S. rice industry seeking relief from Japanese import\nrestrictions.\n    However, the U.S. said it would reexamine the issue if by\nmid-1987 Japan did not roll back import barriers to U.S. rice\nexports.\n    Lyng said he would not be conducting formal negotiations\nnext month with Japan over their beef and citrus quotas, but\nthat his visit \"may be a forerunner in a general way\" to talks\nprior to expiration of the bilateral agreement in March 1988.\n    He said, however, that the U.S. \"will ask for a definite\nliberalization of those items (beef and citrus).... When you\ntranslate 'liberalization' into Japanese, it means do away with\nthe quota.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"
