        "BODY": "Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried\nMartens announced to Parliament a plan to reduce the 1987\ngovernment financing requirement by 20.6 billion francs.\n    He said this will enable the requirement to be held to\n419.7 billion francs, against the previous government target of\n417.8 billion, or eight pct of gross national product.\n    Martens said following a lowering of government estimates\nof 1987 nominal GNP growth and a re-estimation by government\ndepartments of 1987 spending, the government calculated that\nunless action was taken, the requirement would exceed the\ntarget by 22.5 billion francs.\n    Martens said the plan involved raising non-fiscal receipts\nby 5.8 billion francs and reducing spending by 14.3 billion.\nThe remaining 0.5 billion francs will be raised through\ntreasury operations.\n    Martens said the money is being found through a series of\nsmall economies and confirmed that it includes the raising of\ntwo billion francs through the sale of part of the government's\n50 pct holding in the gas company Distrigaz.\n    Last year, the government announced a major program\ndesigned to cut 1987 spending by 195 billion francs.\n    The program was designed to get Belgium out of what the\ngovernment said was a \"snowball effect\" under which the\ngovernment constantly borrowed more to finance budget deficits\nwhich were due largely to the cost of servicing and repaying\nexisting debt.\n    In 1986, the government financing requirement is estimated\nat 561 billion francs or 11.0 pct of GNP.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
