        "BODY": "French farmers are planning to cut their\nmaize sowings by between 100,000 and 150,000 hectares this year\nfrom the 1.87 mln ha harvested in 1986, the French Maize\nProducers' Association, AGPM, said.\n    It said its first estimate of planting intentions indicated\ncuts of 15 to 20 pct in plantings in the northern region of\nPicardy and the Paris Basin, which harvested 192,000 ha last\nyear.\n    In the centre-west region of Poitou-Charentes, plantings\nwere estimated four to seven pct up on last year's harvested\n244,000 ha.\n    Planting intentions in the south-east ranged between nine\npct less and two pct more than last year's 125,000 ha. In the\nsouth-west the AGPM said producers intended to plant a similar\narea to last year's 671,100 harvested hectares, provided water\nsupplies are adequate in the Midi-Pyrenees region after the\nlast two years of drought.\n    Meanwhile, the oilseed plant breeding association, AMSOL,\nsaid sunflower plantings in France this year are indicated at\nbetween 900,000 and 950,000 ha against 829,000 harvested last\nyear, while soya plantings are indicated at 80,000 ha against\nlast year's harvested 48,000.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
