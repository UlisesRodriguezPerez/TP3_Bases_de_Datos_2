        "BODY": "The Federal Reserve is expected to\nenter the U.S. government securities market to add reserves\nduring its usual intervention period today, economists said.\n    With federal funds trading at a steady 6-3/16 pct, most\neconomists expect an indirect injection of temporary reserves\nvia a medium-sized round of customer repurchase agreements.\n    However, some economists said the Fed may arrange more\naggressive system repurchase agreements.\n    Economists would also not rule out an outright bill pass\nearly this afternoon. Such action had been widely anticipated\nyesterday but failed to materialize.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
