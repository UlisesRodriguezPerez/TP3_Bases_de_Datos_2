        "BODY": "The 11,254,837 acres of highly erodable\nfarmland submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for\nthe conservation reserve program was within trade guesses of\n10-12 mln and should have an overall neutral impact on grain\nand soybean prices Monday, grain traders said.\n    Farmers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage in\nthe conservation program to take advantage of a corn bonus\nrental payment that was offered by the USDA, which may underpin\nnew crop futures, they said.\n    New crop corn prices firmed earlier this week on ideas of a\nlarge sign-up in the program. But traders noted that the poor\nyielding acres being set-aside will result in only a modest\ndecrease in final production figures, since farmers will\nconcentrate on high yielding land.\n    Of a total 11,254,837 erodoble acres submitted, usda\naccepted 10,572,402 acres into the program at an average rental\npayment of 51.17 dlrs per acre.\n    Farm land signed up to date now totals 19,488,587 acres.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
