        "DATELINE": "    CHICAGO, April 7 - ",
        "BODY": "Petroleum futures rallied today in a\nmarket that was expecting declines in domestic supplies and\nbecame further unsettled by escalated Mideast fighting.\n    Crude oil, gasoline and heating oil all posted gains on the\nNew York Mercantile Exchange, with crude oil prices matching\nlife-of-contract highs. Crude for delivery in May closed 17\ncents higher at 18.84 dlrs a barrel.\n    \"Crude futures could jump above 19 dlrs a barrel but will\nnot remain there long if products are not strong,\" Robert\nMurphy, account executive at E.F. Hutton, said.\n    Traders said prices were supported by anticipation that the\nAmerican Petroleum Institute would report a decline in domestic\ninventories of petroleum products in a weekly report.\n    Traders said prices also were supported by an escalation in\nthe Iran-Iraq war, with the Iranians reportedly launching a new\noffensive against Iraqi positions, and Iraq attacking offshore\noil fields and an oil export depot.\n    Buying by speculators continued to prompt gains in gold and\nsilver futures on the Commodity Exchange in New York.\n    Gold prices retreated at midday, but rallied before the\nclose with support from the silver market, which was\napproaching two-year highs, traders said.\n    Soybean futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Board of\nTrade, while corn and wheat were mostly higher.\n    Traders said cash sales have been slow in the country, and\nthe soybean harvest in Brazil has been delayed by rain, which\nis limiting supplies.\n    In addition, the Agriculture Department last week projected\na substantial drop in soybean acreage this year.     Monday's\nreport that the USDA inspected 46 mln bushels of corn for\nexport last week was unexpectedly high and, coupled with a lack\nof farm sales, provided support for the corn market, traders\nsaid.\n    Live hogs and frozen pork bellies rallied on the Chicago\nMercantile Exchange, while cattle ended lower.\n    Live hogs pushed ahead on a lack of supplies because many\nfarmers are turning their attention to spring planting rather\nthan marketing livestock, traders said, noting that cash sales\nhave been lighter than expected this week.\n    The lack of marketing also has supported pork bellies, but\nprices drifted lower for moderate losses in nearby months as\nspeculators sold contracts to take profits, traders said.\n    Cattle prices closed lower but continued to show strength\nrelated to tight supplies.\n    Prices pushed ahead to new contract highs, extending gains\npast three-year peaks set Monday, as tight supplies forced meat\npackers to bid aggressively for available animals.\n    However, some traders sold contracts to take profits after\nthe extended rally, which has seen the April delivery contract\nsoar to 69.90 cents a pound from 56 cents a pound at the start\nof the year.\n    New York coffee futures closed higher on trade talk Brazil\nwould not be an aggressive seller near term, analysts said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
