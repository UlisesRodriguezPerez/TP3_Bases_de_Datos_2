        "DATELINE": "    WELLINGTON, March 31 - ",
        "BODY": "<Fletcher Challenge Ltd> (FCL)\nManaging Director Hugh Fletcher said he was disappointed that\n<Rada Corp Ltd> had decided to sell its shares in <N.Z. Forest\nProducts Ltd> (NZFP) to Australia's <Amcor Ltd>.\n    He said in a statement that FCL had made an offer for the\n24 pct of NZFP held by Rada. He said the FCL offer was better\nthan Amcor's because it would have been made to all NZFP\nshareholders, but he gave no further details.\n    Amcor and NZFP said earlier today they were merging their\npulp and paper interests in a joint partnership and were\nincreasing their existing cross-shareholdings.\n    The plan involves NZFP increasing its current holding in\nAmcor to about 20 pct from four pct. Amcor will acquire Rada's\nNZFP stake to add to its existing 11 pct and will seek\nstatutory approval to increase its holding to 50 pct.\n    Rada bought its stake for 505.5 mln dlrs from <Wattie\nIndustries Ltd> last year, but it has not disclosed the price\nto be paid by Amcor.\n    FCL originally launched a takeover bid for NZFP late last\nyear with a scrip and/or cash offer at 3.90 dlrs a share,\nvaluing the company at 1.3 billion dlrs. NZFP shares ended at\n3.88 dlrs today.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
