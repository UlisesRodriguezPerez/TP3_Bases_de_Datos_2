        "BODY": "French official reserves fell 45.06\nbillion francs to 375.95 billion at the end of January from\n421.00 billion at the end of December, the Finance Ministry\nsaid in a statement.\n    It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreign\ncurrency that preceded the January 11 realignment of the\nEuropean Monetary System (EMS).\n    Foreign currency reserves fell by 8.91 billion francs\nduring the month, the ministry said.\n    This reflected outflows of 10.26 billion francs through\noperations of the French exchange stabilisation fund,\ncounterbalanced by a gain of 1.35 billion francs resulting from\nthe quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits held\nwith the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM).\n    But most of the decline reflected a 33.90 billion franc\ndeficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as a\nresult of using very short-term financing instruments.\n    The Bank of France, in conjunction with the Bundesbank and\nother central banks, intervened heavily in foreign exchange\nmarkets between late December and the January 11 EMS accord, in\nan attempt to hold down the mark, which was attracting a flight\nof funds from the dollar, and simultaneously shore up the\nfranc.\n    On January 11, the mark was revalued by three pct against\nthe French franc, relieving pressure on the French currency.\n    The fall in foreign exchange reserves took these reserves\nto 98.83 billion francs at the end of January from 107.74\nbillion at end December.\n    Gold reserves were unchanged at 218.45 billion francs.\n    Reserves of European Currency Units fell to 73.25 billion\nfrancs from 75.27 billion at end December.\n    Claims on the International Monetary Fund fell 219 mln\nfrancs to 19.31 billion francs.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
