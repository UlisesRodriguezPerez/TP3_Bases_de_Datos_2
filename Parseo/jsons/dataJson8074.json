        "BODY": "Nigeria's Central Bank has changed the\nrules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analysts\nsee as a means of defending the naira currency, which has\ndepreciated steadily.\n    The bank said in a statement that from April 2, banks\nbidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate they\noffered and not, as presently, at the rate of the lowest\nsuccessful bid made at the auction.\n    This should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure\nthat they were successful while paying the lower \"marginal\" rate,\nanalysts said.\n    \"It should act as a brake because banks will know that if\nthey bid high they will have to pay what they offered,\" a\nWestern diplomat commented.\n    The naira has depreciated against the dollar by 62 pct\nsince the auctions, known as the Second-Tier Foreign Exchange\nMarket (SFEM), began last September 26.\n    At last week's session the Nigerian currency was fixed at\n4.0 to the dollar, the third fall in a row.\n    \"They were clearly worried... And this is the logical way of\ntrying to stop the trend,\" the diplomat said.\n    The Central Bank also announced the auctions would be\nfortnightly, not weekly, beginning on April 2.\n    It was not immediately clear whether next Thursday's\nscheduled session would still take place, nor if the bank was\nplanning to double the 50 mln dlrs which are normally on offer\nat each auction.\n    Demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstripped\nsupply, encouraging banks to bid high and thus further\nweakening the naira.\n    If the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at the\nfortnightly session, high demand could undermine the objective\nof the new system, analysts said.\n    Although bidding banks will now pay what they offered, the\nofficial exchange rate for the naira applying to business\ntransactions will continue to be the marginal rate -- the\nlowest successful bid.\n    SFEM is a central part of Nigeria's structural adjustment\nprogram, which is considered to be the most ambitious economic\nrecovery plan in Black Africa.\n    The program involves setting a realistic exchange rate for\nthe naira, which was over-valued for many years, liberalising\nimports, boosting agriculture, removing subsidies and reducing\ninefficient government participation in the economy.\n    The World Bank has played a prominent part in designing\nthis dramatic blue-print and in selling it to an often\nsceptical public which fears inflation and lower living\nstandards.\n    Ishrat Husain, the World Bank's representative in Nigeria,\nsaid yesterday he was satisfied both with the adjustment\nprogram as a whole and the foreign exchange auctions.\n    \"So far so good\" he told a meeting of bankers in Lagos,\nadding that only members of Nigeria's import-dependent elite\nwould suffer hardship while the common man would benefit.\n    Fears that the program would encourage inflation were\nincorrect, he said.\n    Bumper harvests had reduced rural inflation and urban\nprices had already reflected the naira's black market value\nbefore the currency was allowed to find its true level last\nSeptember.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
