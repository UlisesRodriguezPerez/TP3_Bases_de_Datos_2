        "BODY": "Zambia will retain its foreign-exchange\nauction system despite the suspension of weekly auctions since\nJanuary 24, President Kenneth Kaunda said.\n    \"We have not run away from the auction. It hasn't been\nabolished at all,\" he told Reuters in an interview.\n    He said the system would be reintroduced after current\ntalks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund\nand, he hoped, would be backed by fresh foreign aid funds.\n    Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auction\nsystem would be used to allocate foreign exchange to private\nbidders but not to fix the exchange rate.\n    Kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of the\ngovernment's shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand.\n    It was suspended when the kwacha's rapid devaluation and\nstrong fluctuations made economic planning almost impossible\nfor the government and the private sector, he said.\n    Weekly foreign-exchange auctions began in October 1985. The\nkwacha fell from 2.20 to the dollar to about 15 in 16 months.\nIn January 1987 the government was more than two months in\narrears in paying foreign currency to successful bidders, and\nthe auction was suspended and replaced with a fixed exchange\nrate of nine kwacha to the dollar.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
