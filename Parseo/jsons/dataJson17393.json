        "BODY": "Soviet farmers had sown spring crops\non only 15.8 mln hectares or 11 pct of cultivated land by April\n27, compared with 26.2 mln ha by April 21, 1986, Izvestia said.\n    Grains and pulses (except maize) were sown on 6.7 mln ha,\ncompared with 13.1 mln at the same time last year, it added.\n    Spring sowing is off to a slow start, with planting two to\nfour weeks behind schedule in many areas of the Ukraine,\nByelorussia and Russia, because the winter was unusually cold.\n    Western agricultural experts believe the crop could still\nbe good but heavy winterkill will make it difficult to reach\nthe 1987 grain target of 232 mln tonnes. The 1986 crop was 210\nmln.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
