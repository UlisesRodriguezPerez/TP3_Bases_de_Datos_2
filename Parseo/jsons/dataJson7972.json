        "TITLE": "EC AGREES REDUCTION OF DIESEL EXHAUST EMISSIONS",
        "DATELINE": "    BRUSSELS, March 20 - ",
        "BODY": "The European Community (EC) agreed\ntough new rules to cut diesel exhaust emissions from trucks and\nbuses in an attempt to reduce air pollution threatening vast\nstretches of the region's forests.\n    Diplomats said EC environment ministers meeting here agreed\nmember states would have to reduce by 20 pct over the next few\nyears the emission of nitrogen oxide, widely seen as the main\nsource of acid rain endangering forests and lakes.\n    The reduction would be compulsory for heavy vehicles, with\ntougher standards imposed for new models from April 1988 and\nfor all new vehicles from October 1990.\n    The EC's executive Commission says the emission level of\nnitrogen oxide was expected to drop to 2.4 mln tonnes a year\nfrom three mln tonnes within the 12-nation Community if all\nheavy vehicles applied to the new standards.\n    There are an estimated nine mln lorries and buses in use in\nthe EC, according to Commission figures.\n    The ministers also gave West Germany a go-ahead to move\ntowards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol, after Bonn\nrequested permission to do so to encourage the use of\nlow-pollution cars, diplomats said.\n    West Germany will still need ministers' final approval for\nsuch a plan. Diplomats said this was expected when EC\nenvironment ministers meet next on May 21.\n    But the ministers added that the go-ahead for West Germany\ndid not mean there would automatically follow a Community-wide\nban on the sale of regular leaded petrol.\n    Bonn intends to keep leaded premium petrol pumps, diplomats\nsaid. They added that, of the 97 mln cars in the EC, only 20\nmln now ran on regular leaded petrol and these would risk no\ndamage if they switched over to premium leaded petrol.\n    Under EC law, ministers have to give member states special\npermission if they wish to be exempt from Community competition\nlaws. This would be the case if West Germany were to implement\na ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
