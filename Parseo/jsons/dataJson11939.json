        "BODY": "Cash grain dealers reported slow country\nmovement of corn and soybeans across the Midwest, with even\ncorn sales from PIK-and-roll activity seen earlier this week\ndrying up.\n    Some dealers said the USDA may further adjust the posted\ncounty price at the Gulf to take into account high barge\nfreight rates as a way to keep corn sales flowing, but added\nthe current plan probably will be given a few weeks to see if\nit will work as hoped.\n    Corn and soybean basis values continued to drop on the\nIllinois and MidMississippi River due to the strong barge\nfreight rates. Toledo and Chicago elevators were finishing\nloading the first corn boats of the new shipping season,\nsupporting spot basis values at those terminal points.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003"
