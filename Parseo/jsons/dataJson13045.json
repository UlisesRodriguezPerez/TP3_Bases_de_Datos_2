        "BODY": "The U.K. government hopes for a\nbreakthrough on the deadlock with Japan over trade policies\nduring next week's visit to Tokyo by Corporate Affairs Minister\nMichael Howard, political sources said.\n    Howard, who leaves for Japan tomorrow, told Reuters he will\ntry to promote understanding on trade issues during his visit.\n    Meanwhile, Britain will re-examine a letter from Japanese\nPrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone promising personal help in\nsolving the row over a U.K. firm's bid to win a significant\nrole in Japan's telecommunications market, government sources\nsaid.\n    Tensions have risen following Britain's decision to arm\nitself early with new statutory powers which it says could be\nused against certain Japanese financial institutions.\n    Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter from\nNakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, seeing it as a\nsignal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory\noutcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc,\ngovernment officials said.\n    But this view has since been clouded by reports from Tokyo\nthat Nakasone's assurances really constituted little more than\npoliteness in the face of British anger, they added.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
