You\ndon't want to put interest rates up unless you have to,\" Volcker\ntold the Senate Banking Committee.\n    \"That is not a constructive way to proceed,\" he said.\n    Volcker said that given a choice between squeezing the\nbudget deficit or squeezing investment, he would favor\nsqueezing the budget deficit.\n    In response to a question about banks, Volcker said he\nwould be pleased if Congress decided to give banks a tax\nwriteoff as an incentive for them to take greater reserves\nagainst loans to debtor countries.\n    \"If you give a tax writeoff for reserving against loans,\nthen we will see more reserving and that would make me happy,\"\nVolcker told Committee Chairman Sen William Proxmire (D-Wisc).\n Reuter\n\u0003"
