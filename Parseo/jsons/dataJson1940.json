        "BODY": "Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves hit a\nnew high of more than 51 billion U.S. Dlrs on March 4, compared\nwith 50 billion in mid-February and 25.1 billion a year\nearlier, the central bank said.\n    Bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the increase\ncame mainly from the bank's purchases of more than one billion\nU.S. Dlrs on the local interbank market between February 18 and\nMarch 4.\n    He said the rise showed signs of slowing, however, because\nTaiwan has liberalised import policy and expects its trade\nsurplus to decline over the next few months as a result.\n    Chang declined to predict how high the reserves might rise,\nbut local economists have forecast they will hit 60 billion\nU.S. Dlrs by the end of 1987.\n    In January, Taiwan reduced import tariffs of up to 50 pct\non some 1,700 foreign products. It had been under growing U.S.\nPressure to cut its 1986 record 13.6 billion dlr trade surplus\nwith the U.S. Taiwan's 1985 surplus with the U.S. Was 10.2\nbillion, according to official statistics.\n    Wang Chang-Ming, Vice Chairman of the Council for Economic\nPlanning and Development, told Reuters the government is\nplanning another round of deep tariff cuts in the second half\nof this year.\n    The reserves could support imports of more than two years\nfor Taiwan, compared with about three months for Japan and the\nU.S.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
