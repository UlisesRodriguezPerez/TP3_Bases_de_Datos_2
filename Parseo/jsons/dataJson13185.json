        "BODY": "The United States defended its sales\nof stockpiled tin in 1986 in reaction to criticism from\nMalaysian miners who have said it violated an agreement with\nsoutheast Asian producers.\n    \"The United States has continued to abide by the spirit of\nthe memorandum of understanding and has consulted with the\nASEAN states on GSA tin disposals,\" a State Department spokesman\nsaid in a statement.\n    \"The views of the ASEAN governments have been taken into\naccount in determining disposal levels,\" the statement said.\n    The United States and the ASEAN countries signed a\nmemorandum of understanding concerning tin disposals by the\nU.S. General Services Administration (GSA) in December 1983.\n    In its latest annual report, the States of Malaya Chamber\nof Mines said the GSA sold 5,490 tonnes of tin in 1986, well\nabove an agreed upon annual limit of 3,000 tonnes. \"The United\nStates appears to have lost sight of the U.S./ASEAN Memorandum\nof Understanding,\" it said.\n    The State Department statement said GSA tin disposals\nincreased in calendar year 1986 due to changed market\nconditions. During the first quarter of calendar year 1987,\nthey have been running at a lower rate compared to 1986.\n    The spokesman declined to say how much stockpiled tin the\nGSA sold last year, however.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
