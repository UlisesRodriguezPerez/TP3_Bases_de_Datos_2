        "DATELINE": "    NEW YORK, March 18 - ",
        "BODY": "The Reagan administration will\nconsider curbing foreign takeovers of security-sensitive\nindustries such as semiconductors and computers, the New York\nTimes said, quoting an unnamed senior administration official.\n    \"I think there's a strong sentiment here that some\nindustries are not totally up for grabs,\" the paper quoted the\nofficial as saying.\n    \"Two of the most visible (industries) are semiconductor and\ncomputer companies,\" said the official, who the newspaper said\nwas a central figure in the opposition to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd\n<ITSU.T> takeover bid for <Fairchild Semiconductor Corp>.\n    The Fairchild-Fujitsu deal was abandoned on Monday, and\nindustry analysts said the move was a victory for the Reagan\nadministration in its drive to beat back Japanese competition\nin the important computer chip manufacturing industry.\n    Officials told Reuters last week that Commerce Secretary\nMalcolm Baldrige and Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger fought\nthe planned sale of Fairchild by French-controlled Schlumberger\nLtd <SLB> to Japan's largest computer maker because it could\nhave left the U.S. Military dependent on foreign sources for\nvital technology.\n    The New York Times quoted Baldrige as saying the time had\ncome to limit takeovers in security-sensitive areas.\n    \"Everybody wants an open investment policy, but there have\nto be some exceptions for the national interest,\" Baldrige was\nquoted as saying.\n    The newspaper said Baldrige and Weinberger are expected to\nbring the takeover issue before a top-level interagency\npolicymaking group, such as Treasury Secretary James Baker's\nEconomic Policy Council or the president's National Security\nCouncil.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
