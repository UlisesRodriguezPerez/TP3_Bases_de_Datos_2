        "BODY": "Hong Kong has not taken unfair\nadvantage of its currency's link with the U.S. Dollar, Hong\nKong monetary affairs secretary David Nendick told the annual\nmeeting of the Asian Development Bank here.\n    He said: \"We have taken the rough with the smooth, having to\naccept a downward adjustment of our economy in 1985 following a\nperiod when the U.S. Dollar was clearly overvalued in world\nterms, but benefiting as that currency subsequently declined.\"\nHe said that since the establishment of the link in 1983, Hong\nKong's trade had been broadly in balance. This year a modest\ndeficit was expected.\n    \"Under the link, Hong Kong's entirely free and open economy\ncontinues to adjust quickly to any external imbalances, but the\nburden of adjustment now falls almost entirely on our domestic\ninterest rates, money supply and price levels,\" Nendick said.\n    \"The relative volatility in these domestic variables is the\nprice we pay for the stability of our currency against the U.S.\nDollar,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
