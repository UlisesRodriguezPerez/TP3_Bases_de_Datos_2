        "BODY": "Upcoming changes being considered in\nthe U.S. Agriculture Department's transportation and loan\nprograms were outlined by a USDA official today.\n    Addressing the annual meeting of the National Grain and\nFeed Association, Tom VonGarlem, assistant deputy administrator\nfor USDA's state and county operations, said the following\nchanges are under consideration by USDA.\n    Termination of USDA's Transportation Assistance Program for\nwheat, barley and sorghum would be proposed this week.\n    Changes in USDA's reserve rotation program are also under\nconsideration, VonGarlem said. While the department has not\nmade any final decision, banning the use of pik and roll grain\nin reserve rotation is under heavy consideration, he said.\n    Changes in loan rates will definitely be looked at for next\nyear's crop, he said, with the option of making soybean loans\npartially in cash and in certificates under consideration.\n    VanGarlem said he will definitely not extend the 1987 crop\nprogram signup, saying he sees no reason to do so at this time.\n    He also said wheat will not be considered for a cash bonus\nunder the Conservation Reserve Program.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
