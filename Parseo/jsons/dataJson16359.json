        "BODY": "Current prospects for this year's\ngrain crop in Bulgaria and Romania appear less favorable than\nin 1986, the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Belgrade\nsaid in a field report.\n    The report said the assessment was based on travel in the\ntwo countries from March 30 to April 4.\n    It said crop conditions were better than earlier expected\nfollowing the extreme dry conditions last fall and the\nprolonged winter temperatures this spring.\n    However, in general plant development was at least three\nweeks or more behind normal this spring, and conditions varied\ngreatly by regions, the report said.\n    Fields seeded during the optimum period last fall, and\nespecially those receiving supplemental irrigation water (about\n65 pct of the fields observed), appeared to be in good\ncondition, with little evidence of winterkill, while others\nvaried considerably, the report said.\n    Fields lacking adequate moisture last fall showed weak and\nuneven stands. Spotty germination and winterkill in those\nfields averaged 10 to 30 pct, it said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
