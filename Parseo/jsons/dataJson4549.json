        "BODY": "A marketing loan for U.S. wheat,\nfeedgrains and soybeans would do nothing to help the surplus\nproduction situation and would be extremely costly, Sen. Rudy\nBoschwitz (R-Minn.) said.\n    \"I think I would not support a marketing loan now,\" he told\nthe House agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and\nfeedgrains. Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of a\nmarketing loan for cotton and rice, but has since focused\nsupport on decoupling legislation, the Boren/Boschwitiz bill.\n    A market loan for grains and soybeans would encourage more\nproduction, especially in high-yielding areas, would be much\nmore expensive than the current cotton and rice marketing loans\nand not increase exports significantly, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
