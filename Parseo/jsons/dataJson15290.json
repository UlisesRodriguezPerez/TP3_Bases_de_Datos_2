        "BODY": "All steers imported into the United\nStates from Mexico must now be branded with the letter M on the\nright jaw, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.\n    In its World Production and Trade Report, the department\nsaid the branding is necessary to improve surveillance for\nbovine tuberculosis because it provides a permanent way to\nidentify Mexican steers.\n    The requirement is not expected to affect the number of\nMexican steers imported into the United States and the brand\nwill be applied before the animals arrive at U.S. ports of\nentry.\n    Last November, the Mexican Government authorized an export\nquota of nearly 1.1 mln head of live cattle for the 1986/87\nseason (Aug-July), most of which goes to the United States.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
