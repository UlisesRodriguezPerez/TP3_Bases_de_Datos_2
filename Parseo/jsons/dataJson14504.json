        "TITLE": "GENCORP <GY> SAYS BUYBACK BETTER THAN TAKEOVER",
        "DATELINE": "    AKRON, Ohio, April 7 - ",
        "BODY": "GenCorp Inc said the decision by\nGeneral Partners, comprised of AFG Industries and Wagner and\nBrown, to end its hostile offer for the company supports its\nbelief that the buy back offer it announced yesterday was a\n\"financially superior alternative.\"\n    GenCorp said it would annouce details of its plans to buy\nback 54 pct of its stock for 1.6 billion dlrs, or 130 dlrs a\nshare, later this week. GenCorp's buy back was made to fend off\nthe hostile 2.3 billion dlr, 100-dlr-a-share, tender offer by\nAFG and Wagner and Brown.\n    Earlier today AFG and Wagner and Brown said that without\nthe benefit of additional information available to GenCorp's\nmanagement, it cannot compete economically with GenCorp's\nproposal.\n    The group said it is ending its tender offer for GenCorp\nand promptly return to tendering shareholders all shares\ntendered pursuant to its offer.\n    The group owns 9.8 pct, or 2,180,608 shares, of GenCorp's\noutstanding shares.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
