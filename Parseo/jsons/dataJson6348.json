        "BODY": "Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Ali\nal-Khalifa al-Sabah said in a newspaper interview that no OPEC\nmember was exceeding oil production quotas allocated by the\n13-nation group.\n    Sheikh Ali told Kuwait's daily al-Anba \"All OPEC states,\nwithout exception, are producing within the quotas allocated to\nthem. Some of them are producing less.\"\n    Some oil industry sources had said the United Arab\nEmirates, which had been generally been producing over its\nquota since OPEC returned to quotas last September, was still\npumping more than its allotted amount in the first months of\nthis year.\n    Ecuador had also publicly stated it was over its quota, but\nan earthquake early this month stopped that. Iraq has rejected\nits quota, but oil sources say it may be having problems\nmarketing at official prices all the oil it wants to sell.\n    OPEC agreed in December to cut overall oil production by\n7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the first six\nmonths of this year and abide by fixed prices around 18 dlrs a\nbarrel from February 1.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
