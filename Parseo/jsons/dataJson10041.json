        "BODY": "AB Volvo <VOLV.ST> said the weakening\ndollar caused the drop in its 1986 profits, but company chief\nexecutive Pehr Gyllenhammar said 1986 was one of Volvo's best\nyears ever.\n    In its final report released earlier, the company said the\ngroup's 1986 profits before allocations and taxes was 7.53\nbillion crowns  compared with 1985's 7.60 billion.\n    Despite the fall, Gyllenhammar said, \"Sales of industrial\nproducts have never been higher, and Volvo Cars and Volvo\nTrucks were both completely sold out at year-end. Operating\nincome was slightly higher than a year earlier.\"\n    He said the company's financial strength gave it\nexceptional opportunities to invest for the future.\n    Although industrial sales were up, the company's yearend\nreport said total sales were 84.09 billion crowns against\n1985's 86.19 billion.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
