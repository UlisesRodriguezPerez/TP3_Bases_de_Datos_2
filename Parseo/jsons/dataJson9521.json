        "BODY": "Argentine grain producers again\nreduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986/87\nsoybean crop, which will begin to be harvested in mid-April,\ntrade sources said.\n    They said growers now forecast soybean production this\nseason at between 7.5 and 7.8 mln tonnes, down from last week's\nestimate of 7.7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8.0 to 8.4 mln\ntonnes forecast in mid-February.\n    The new forecast is still higher than last season's record\ntotal production.\n    Private sources put 1985/86 production at a record 7.2 to\n7.3 mln tonnes -- 4.2 to 6.4 pct lower than the new forecast\nfor the current crop. The official figure for 1985/86 is 7.1\nmln tonnes, 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this season's new estimates.\n    Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods\nin the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe\nprovinces and northern Buenos Aires.\n    The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures\nand inadequate rainfall. Growers fear they may find more empty\npods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield.\n    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to\n3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86\nrecord of 3.34 mln hectares.\n    The state of the crop continued to be good in general until\nlast week but intense, heavy rains since could have caused\ndamage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm.\n    Where the rains were less heavy they were considered\nbeneficial although too late to improve yield estimates.\n    The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in\nsouthern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to\ninfluence production forecasts.\n    In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, where\nrainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maize\nand sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged.\n    The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by\nrains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, La\nPampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios.\n    The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and\n3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln\nhectares in 1985/86.\n    The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast at\nbetween 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes.\n    This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to\n12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 production\nand 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes.\n    The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the\narea sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires\nalthough at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods.\n    A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is\nimpossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of\nsunshine dries the fields.\n    The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down\n29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year's record 3.14 mln hectares.\n    Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3\nto 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of\n4.1 mln tonnes.\n    The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the\nrains, advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting\nin La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown.\n    The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2\npct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season.\n    Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to\n22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
