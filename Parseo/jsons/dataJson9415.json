        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 25 - ",
        "BODY": "Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige\nsaid the United States will not stand idly by and let Japan\ndominate the world electronics market.\n    Baldrige told the Senate Finance Committee the United\nStates would insist Japan open its markets to U.S. products as\nthe U.S. market is open to Japanese products.\n    Asked after his testimony if this meant the United States\nwould close its markets to Japan if they did not open theirs,\nBaldrige said, \"I'm not prepared to say that, but it certainly\nwould be one of the alternatives studied.\"\n    Baldrige said in his testimony Japan had a closed\nsupercomputer market and a restricted telecommunications\nmarket.\n    \"I can only conclude that the common objective of the\nJapanese government and industry is to dominate the world\nelectronics market. Given the importance of this market to U.S.\nindustry in general and our defense base in particular, we\ncannot stand by idly,\" he said.\n    He said it was these concerns about national security which\nled him to express reservations over the proposed acquisition\nof Fairchild Semiconductor by Fujitsu of Japan.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
