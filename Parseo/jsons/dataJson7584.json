In\nFebruary 1986, the RPI rose 0.4 pct, giving a 5.1 pct\nyear-on-year increase on the old basis.\n    The inflation data compares with market forecasts for a\nrise of 0.4 - 0.5 pct in February and a yearly rise of about\nfour pct, economists said.\n    The Employment Department said the rise in the index\nbetween January and February was mainly the result of higher\nprices for petrol, fresh vegetables, cars and car maintenance.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
