        "BODY": "Comalco Ltd said its return to profit\nreflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium prices and\nits withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture.\n    It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the\nyear ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was\nalso aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and\ngreater sales of bauxite and aluminium.\n    Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per\nshare final dividend, delayed until July 1 to take advantage of\nproposed dividend imputation laws.\n    This would make five cents for the year against a first and\nfinal of one cent in 1985.\n    Comalco said the aluminium industry continues to suffer\nfrom low prices and excess capacity, though the weak Australian\ndollar had helped earnings.\n    Comalco's Commonwealth Aluminium Corp unit said earlier it\nhas conditionally agreed to sell its Goldendale smelter in\nWashington, and port facilities at Portland, Oregon to Columbia\nAluminium Corp. Comalco said its extraordinary provision of\n27.3 mln dlrs costs for Goldendale losses and closure may be\nreduced if the sales agreement were completed.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
