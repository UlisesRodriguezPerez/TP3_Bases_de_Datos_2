        "BODY": "West German use of tapioca is likely to\ndecline further despite favourable prices and import licences\nfor only 420,000 tonnes have been registered since the start of\nthe current agricultural year, compared with 640,000 tonnes\nduring August/April the previous year, trade sources said.\n    The 12 European Community (EC) countries have licensed a\ntotal of 4.22 mln tonnes, while at the same year-earlier period\nthe EC contracted for 3.17 mln tonnes, they said.\n    The Netherlands is registering an increase in licences to\naround 2.9 mln tonnes, up 400,000 tonnes from last year, they\nsaid.\n    Total EC tapioca imports during the current agricultural\nyear are expected to stagnate at last year's level of around\n6.0 mln tonnes, the sources said.\n    They reported a rise in consumption and in import licences\nfor France, Spain and Belgium but said the West German compound\nfeed industry was increasingly using grain in feed mixtures.\n    Sellers quoted tapioca for nearby delivery at around 27\nmarks per 100 kilos against 37 marks in March and 34 marks in\nApril last year.\n    Feed barley was quoted at about 42 marks per 100 kilos,\nresulting in higher West German feed stuff prices, but demand\nwas seen as slack.\n    The sources said the West German feed industry was trying\nto help cut the grain surplus through increased use of grain in\nfeed mixtures.\n    Other EC member countries are likely to take advantage of\nthe lower tapioca prices, they said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
