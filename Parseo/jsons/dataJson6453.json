        "TITLE": "WEST GERMAN BANKS SLOWLY CUTTING KEY SAVINGS RATES",
        "DATELINE": "    FRANKFURT, March 18 - ",
        "BODY": "West German commercial banks are\ncautiously cutting key savings and lending rates, banking\nsources said. The cuts follow nearly two months after the\nBundesbank reduced leading interest rates, far longer than the\nusual interim period.\n    A Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> spokesman said it is cutting\nleading savings rate for private customers on a regional basis\nby 0.5 percentage points to two pct. Dresdner Bank AG <DRSD.F>\nand Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> have initiated similar moves. Bank\nfuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG <BKFG.F> cut rates 0.5 pct generally.\n    The delay was partly due to commercial banks' desire to\ngauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savings\nbanks.\n    A fall in customer savings because of lower rates could\nreduce cheap refinancing available to banks, forcing them to\ndraw down relatively expensive funds from other sources, one\neconomist at the German Banking Association said.\n    But the volume of savings funds may not be substantially\nundercut by lower savings rates because many customers are\nparking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvest\nthem at higher yields in the future, he said.\n    He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move more\nfunds from relatively short-term deposits to longer-dated\nsecurities to reduce strong growth in its central bank money\nsupply aggregate.\n    The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7.5\npct in February against the fourth quarter of last year,\nunchanged from January. The growth rate was outside the\nexpanded target range of three to six pct.\n    Few banks have so far reduced lending rates to private\ncustomers, though lending rates for corporate customers are\nbeginning to decline.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
