        "BODY": "Employers in Rotterdam's troubled\ngeneral cargo sector have decided to restart stalled redundancy\nprocedures within a week, employers' organisation labour\nrelations manager Gerard Zeebregts told Reuters.\n    Port and transport union spokesman Bert Duim said the\nemployers' decision would not lead to the immediate resumption\nof eight weeks of strikes in the sector.\n    The strike action was called off on Friday after an interim\ncourt injunction against the employers' plans for 350\nredundancies this year.\n    A court in Amsterdam ruled last week the employers had made\nan error in the complicated procedure for obtaining permission\nfor the redundancies and therefore could not proceed until a\nfinal ruling on May 7.\n    Zeebregts said the initiation of new procedure might well\ntake up to two months, but the employers were not prepared\nsimply to sit and wait for the May 7 court ruling with the\nchance they would have to start all over again in any case.\n    \"We cannot afford not to continue with our plans. The\nstrikes have already cost a lot of money and damaged business,\nand further delays would do even more damage,\" Zeebregts said.\n    The campaign of lightning strikes in the port's general\ncargo sector began on January 19 in protest at employers' plans\nfor 800 redundancies from the sector's 4,000 strong workforce\nby 1990, starting with 350 this year.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
