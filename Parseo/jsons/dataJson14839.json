        "BODY": "Tug crews in New South Wales (NSW),\nVictoria and Western Australia yesterday lifted their ban on\nforeign-flag ships carrying containers but NSW ports are still\nbeing disrupted by a separate dispute, shipping sources said.\n    The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented\nthe movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said.\n    The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration\nCommission today.\n    Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the\nports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said.\n    The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week\nof action called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council to\nprotest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws.\n    The shipping sources said the various port unions appear to\nbe taking it in turn to work for a short time at the start of\neach shift and then to walk off.\n    Cargo handling in the ports has been disrupted, with\ncontainer movements most affected, but has not stopped\naltogether, they said.\n    They said they could not say how long the disruption will\ngo on and what effect it will have on shipping movements.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
