        "TITLE": "KEY U.S. HOUSE PANEL FINISHES MAJOR TRADE BILL",
        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, March 25 - ",
        "BODY": "The House Ways and Means Committee\ncompleted action on legislation to toughen U.S. trade laws,\nchairman Dan Rostenkowski said.\n    The committee's consideration of one of the most\ncontroversial provisions, a plan to force major trade surplus\ncountries to cut their trade imbalance with the United States,\nwas deferred until the full House considers the trade bill, its\nsponsor Rep. Richard Gephardt said.\n    Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, told Reuters he was not\ncertain the exact form his trade surplus reduction proposal\nwould take. Last year the House approved his plan to force a 10\npct surplus cutback each year for four years, by countries such\nas Japan.\n    The Ways and Means Committess' trade bill forces President\nReagan to retaliate against unfair trade practices that violate\ninternational trade agreements but it allows him to wave\nretaliatory tariffs or quotas if the action would hurt the U.S.\neconomy.\n    The trade bill gives U.S. Trade Representative Clayton\nYeutter more authority in trade negotiations and in decisions\nto grant domestic industries import relief.\n    It also gives him authority to decide whether foreign trade\npractices are unfair and violate U.S. trading rights. These\npowers are currently held by President Reagan.\n    The administration has strongly objected to this transfer\nof authority from Reagan to Yeutter.\n    The bill also extends U.S. authority to negotiate\nmultilateral trade agreements. The bill will be wrapped into\nother trade legislation and voted on in the House in April.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
