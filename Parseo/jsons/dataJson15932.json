        "BODY": "<Noranda Inc> said it began salvage\noperations at its Murdochville, Quebec, mine, where a fire last\nweek killed one miner and caused 10 mln dlrs in damage.\n     Another 56 miners were trapped underground for as long as\n24 hours before they were brought to safety.\n    Noranda said the cause and full extent of the damage is\nstill unknown but said it does know that the fire destroyed\n6,000 feet of conveyor belt.\n     Noranda said work crews have begun securing the ramp\nleading into the zone where the fire was located. The company\nsaid extreme heat from the fire caused severe rock degradation\nalong several ramps and drifts in the mine.\n     Noranda estimated that the securing operation for the zone\nwill not be completed before the end of April.\n    Noranda said the Quebec Health and Safety Commission, the\nQuebec Provincial Police and Noranda itself are each conducting\nan investigation into the fire.\n    Production at the mine has been suspended until the\ninvestigations are complete. The copper mine and smelter\nproduced 72,000 tons of copper anodes in 1986 and employs 680\npeople.\n     The smelter continues to operate with available\nconcentrate from stockpiled supplies, Noranda said.
