        "BODY": "A group of investment firms led by\nFar Hills, N.J., investor Natalie Koether said it is seeking\ninformation about the shareholders of Prime Medical Services\nInc, over which it has said it is seeking control.\n    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,\nthe group, which includes Shamrock Associates, included a March\n6 letter to Prime which asks for a complete list of all\nshareholders and their addresses.\n    The group said it wants the information so it can contact\nshareholders on issues, including election of an opposition\nslate of directors to the board and other proxy contests.\n    The Koether group's letter gives the company five days to\nrespond to its request. If there is no response from Prime\nMedical, the group said it would consider the demand refused\nand would take \"other proper steps\" to get the information.\n    The group said it already holds 1,483,886 Prime Medical\nshares, or 17.5 pct of the total. It said it has taken legal\naction to try to force the company to set an annual meeting and\nrequire all directors to stand for election.\n    In a previous SEC filing, the group has said it has decided\nto try to seek control of Prime Medical through a tender offer,\nexchange offer, proxy contest or other ways.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
