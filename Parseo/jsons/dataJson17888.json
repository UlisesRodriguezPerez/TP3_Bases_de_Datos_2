        "BODY": "Japan was ready to use diplomacy to help\nmaintain the security of the Gulf, Prime Minister Yasuhiro\nNakasone said.\n    But he told reporters Japan should not cut its lines of\ncommunication with Iran and Iraq because its policy was to take\na broad political stance. Officials of the foreign ministry\nsaid Japan had maintained good relations with both Iran and\nIraq, which have been at war since September 1980.\n    Last week Nakasone ruled out Japanese military or financial\nhelp to patrol the waters of the Gulf. About 60 pct of Japan's\ncrude oil passes through the waterway.\n    President Reagan said yesterday the threat to oil routes in\nthe Gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq was high on the agenda\nfor next week's G-7 summit in Venice.\n    Reagan has approved plans for the United States to step up\nits naval presence in the Gulf despite congressional\nexpressions of concern and he has called on U.S. Allies to help\nmaintain freedom of navigation.\n    Japan's constitution prevents its armed forces from being\ndeployed overseas. Nakasone has said that Washington\nunderstands this problem.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
