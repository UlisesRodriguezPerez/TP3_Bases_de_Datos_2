        "TITLE": "ENERGY SECRETARY SEES HIGHER OIL PRICES",
        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, June 2 - ",
        "BODY": "Energy Secretary Donald Hodel said he\nexpects oil prices to rise significantly by the year 2000,\nprobably to around 33 dlrs a barrel in current dollars.\n    \"I do anticipate a significant increase (by 2000).\nThirty-three dlrs a barrel is not unreasonable,\" Hodel told the\nSenate Energy Committee.\n    Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through\nthe shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells\nbecause of low prices was probably permanent. He said he was\nalso concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration.\n    Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section\n1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He said\ngeologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery\nof oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay.\n    \"The area could contain potentially recoverable oil\nresources of more than 9.2 billion barrels, an amount nearly\nequal to the Prudhoe Bay oil field, which currently provides\nalmost one-fifth of U.S. domestic production,\" Hodel said.\n    He said production from the new section could begin about\nthe time Prudhoe Bay production begins to decline in 2000\nwithout endangering caribou or other wildlife in the area.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
