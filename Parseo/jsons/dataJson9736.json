        "DATELINE": "    SYDNEY, March 26 - ",
        "BODY": "Australia's largest company, The Broken\nHill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S> (BHP), is expected to report a net\nprofit of around 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs tomorrow for the first\nnine months ended February 28, share analysts polled by Reuters\nsaid.\n    This would be well below the 813.0 mln dlrs earned in the\nfirst three quarters of 1985/86. In the full year ended May 31\n1986 the group earned a record 988.2 mln dlrs.\n    The analysts estimated that the group would report a third\nquarter net in the region of 200 mln to 220 mln dlrs, against\n238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter.\n    BHP's earnings in the first half ended November 30 amounted\nto 397.0 mln dlrs, sharply down from 589.3 mln a year earlier.\n    The analysts predicted that BHP will report an upturn in\npetroleum earnings compared with the first quarter, reflecting\nsome improvement in crude oil prices from the Bass Strait\nfields, but these gains would be offset by lower mineral and\nsteel earnings.\n    They said the mineral group has been hit by lower coal\nprices and shipments to Japan while the steel division has been\naffected by industrial and production problems.\n    The analysts noted that the third quarter is normally BHP's\nlowest-earning period owing to a number of seasonal factors,\nand they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around\n300 mln dlrs.\n    One key factor in the fourth quarter is expected to be a\ntax break of some 70 mln dlrs for the investment allowance on\ncapital expenditure in the steel division, they said.\n    They said they saw BHP's full year earnings at around 900\nmln to 920 mln dlrs. They added that such a decline from\n1985/86 would be no surprise, noting BHP has said that it would\nbe difficult to equal its record 1985/86 net profit.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
