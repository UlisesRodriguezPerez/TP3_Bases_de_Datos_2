        "DATELINE": "    WASHINGTON, April 9 - ",
        "BODY": "Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., introduced\nin the House of Representatives legislation proposed by the\nReagan administration to slash the U.S. sugar price support, a\nspokesman for Porter said.\n    The spokesman said the bill was introduced without any\nchanges from the administration's proposal sent to Congress\nlast month.\n    That plan calls for a cut in the sugar loan rate to 12\ncents per pound from 18 cents now. Sugar growers would be\ncompensated for the price cut with targeted direct payments,\nto be gradually phased-out through 1990. The payments to\ngrowers would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs.\n    Representatives of sugar growers have rejected the\nproposal, saying it would ruin the domestic sugar industry.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
