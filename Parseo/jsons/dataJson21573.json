        "DATELINE": "    TOKYO, Oct 19 - ",
        "BODY": "Tokyo's foreign exchange market is watching\nnervously to see if the U.S. Dollar will drop below the\nsignificant 140.00 yen level, dealers said.\n    \"The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it is\nconsidered to be the lower end of the reference range. If the\ncurrency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,\"\nsaid Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager at Dai-ichi\nKangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division.\n    The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Friday\ncloses of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here.\n    The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of\n140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New York\nand 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10.\n    The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S.\nTreasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said.\n    \"The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish\nsentiment after Baker's comments,\" said Dai-ichi's Tanaka. He\nsaid this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among\nthe group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement the\nLouvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying.\n    The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-day\ndrop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weakness\nin U.S. Bond prices, dealers said.\n    Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but he\nstrongly criticised West German moves to raise key interest\nrates. Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatience\nwith some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accord\ndue to their fears of increasing inflation.\n    Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary\npressures also slow domestic demand.\n    West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings to\nboost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Trade\ndeficit, Tanaka said.\n    U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a still\nmassive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interest\nrates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said.\n    \"Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nations\ncoordinate dollar buying intervention,\" said Soichi Hirabayashi,\ndeputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchange\ndepartment.\n    The target range set by the Louvre accord is generally\nconsidered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said.\n    \"The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near\nfuture and at that time, if operators see the G-7 nations\nfailing to coordinate intervention, they would see the Louvre\naccord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,\"\nHirabayashi said. He said the U.S. Currency could fall as low\nas 135 yen soon.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
