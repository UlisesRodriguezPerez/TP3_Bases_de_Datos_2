        "BODY": "The south China province of Guangdong is\nimporting millions of tonnes of grain a year from overseas and\nother parts of China because farmers have switched from grain\nto more profitable crops, the Peking Review magazine said.\n    The official magazine said the province's grain area fell\nto 4.33 mln hectares in 1985 from 5.7 mln in 1978 out of a\ntotal farmland area of 7.4 mln hectares.\n    Farmers have switched to cash crops such as sugarcane,\nbananas, oranges, papaya and freshwater fish-farming, in part\nto supply major consumer markets in Hong Kong and Macao, the\nmagazine said. It gave no 1986 area figures.\n    The magazine said China aims to keep 80 pct of national\nfarmland under grain, 10 pct under cash crops and 10 pct under\nother crops, although the ratio will vary from place to place.\n    It said primitive cultivation methods, labour-intensity and\nlow productivity make grain the least profitable farm\ncommodity. Farmers in one central region of China can from 0.1\nhectare earn 2,250 yuan a year from vegetables, 375-450 yuan\nfrom cotton or 225 yuan from grain, it added.\n    It said consumer prices for foodgrain can be adjusted only\ngradually as part of a reform of the entire pricing system.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
