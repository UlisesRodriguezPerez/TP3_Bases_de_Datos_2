        "BODY": "Negotiators at a United Nations\nconference on natural rubber are making slow progress towards\nreaching an agreement, delegates said.\n    The conference, which began Monday, is widely seen as the\nfinal effort to adopt a new International Natural Rubber\nAgreement (INRA) before the current one expires in October.\n    Some 40 producing and consuming countries are taking part\nin the two-week meeting. This is the fourth such conference in\nnearly two years.\n    Delegates said both sides still appeared divided on the key\nissue of the price adjustment mechanism.\n    Consumers want frequent price reviews at 12 month intervals\ninstead of 18 months as at present, a proposal currently\nrejected by producers.\n    And while consumers press for the price adjustment to be\nautomatic, producers have resisted reducing the role of the\nInternational Rubber Organization Council in the price\nadjustment procedure.\n    Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand has said it\nwas \"imperative\" to settle outstanding issues this week so that\ntechnical drafting work can be done next week.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
