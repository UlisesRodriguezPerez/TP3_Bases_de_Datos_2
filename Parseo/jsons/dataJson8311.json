        "DATELINE": "    MINNETONKA, MINN., March 23 - ",
        "BODY": "Tonka Corp said it expects\nresults for its fiscal first quarter to end April four, to\ndecline from the record earnings of 3.8 mln dlrs or 57 cts a\nshare and revenues of 53.2 mln dlrs.\n    The toy manufacturer attributed its anticipated lower\nfinancial results to an an expected moderate decline in\nshipments of its Pound Puppies product line.\n    Tonka also said it expects revenues and earnings to remain\nlower through the 1987 first half compared with 1986 record\nresults of 125.4 mln dlrs in revenues and 10.3 mln dlrs in net\nearnings or 1.47 dlrs a share.\n    The company said its level of shipments is good despite a\nconservative buying pattern on the part of retailers industry\nwide. Tonka's first quarter shipments will be down somewhat\nfrom 1986 record levels and gross profit margins will be down\nslightly from a year ago, it said.\n    Second half sales are expected to be stronger based on a\nreturn to a more traditional seasonal shipping pattern in which\nretailers order and stock conservatively early in the year and\ntime large shipments for the second half, it said.\n    Tonka said that while the pace of order writing is trailing\nlast year's, bookings are \"very good\" for orders on several of\nits new product introductions for 1987.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
