        "BODY": "H.J. Heinz <HNZ.N> chairman Tony O'Reilly\nwould be interested in buying Guinness PLC <GUIN.L>'s brewery\ndivision if it were for sale, a spokesman said.\n    The spokesman, reacting to Irish and British press reports,\nsaid \"He continues to be interested were the group to offer the\nbrewery side of Guinness for sale. But he has not put together\na consortium, nor has he been buying shares.\"\n    He was quoted by the Irish magazine Business and Finance as\nsaying he would be interested if it came on the market and that\nhe had the support of two international banks if he decided\nsuch a purchase might be worthwhile.\n    In the magazine article, he suggested that if brewing\nprofits were calculated to be in the region of 80 mln punts,\nthe asking price would not be higher than 800 mln punts.\n    \"A multiple of ten times earnings would be the top whack for\nthe brewing division in the current Guinness situation,\" he\nsaid.\n    \"This would mean an expensive exercise, right on the edge,\nbut not impossible,\" he added.\n    The deal would mean buying the Dublin, London, Nigerian and\nMalaysian breweries because \"It could only be sold as an\nintegral unit if it was going to be sold at all,\" O'Reilly said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
