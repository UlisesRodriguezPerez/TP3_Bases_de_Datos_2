        "BODY": "CSR Ltd has made a bold move in selling\nits oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and\nploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, share\nanalysts said.\n    CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas\ninterests held in the Delhi Australia Fund and would instead\nsell them to Exxon Corp unit Esso Exploration and Production\nAustralia Inc for 985 mln dlrs.\n    In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia's largest\nsugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it\ndoes not already hold in Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd.\n    A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and\n300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright CSR had given\nitself the cash to all but eliminate its debt and embark on an\nambitious expansion programme in its best-performing divisions\nof sugar and building products, analysts said.\n    The Pioneer Sugar investment would give CSR by far the\nlargest stake in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry\nand access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in\nthe country, they said. Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend\nacceptance of the bid, through which CSR would benefit from the\nbottoming out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
