        "DATELINE": "     TROY, Mich., March 12 - ",
        "BODY": "K Mart Corp said its record fiscal\n1986 net earnings of 582.3 mln dlrs, a rise from 221.2 mln dlrs\na year ago, marked a \"major turning point\" for the world's\nsecond biggest retailer.\n    K Mart said the earnings rise for the fourth quarter ended\nJanuary 28 to 285 mln dlrs from 10.5 mln dlrs resulted from \n\"merchandising, refurbishing and expense control.\"\n    A year ago, K Mart took a charge of 239 mln dlrs for\ndiscontinued operations. Earnings from continuing retail\noperations in the quarter totalled 270 mln dlrs or 2.00 dlrs a\nshare compared with 249.4 mln dlrs or 1.91 dlrs a year ago.\n    K Mart Chairman Bernard Fauber said \"the success of these\nprograms is better illustrated by the strong 35.9 pct increase\nin 1986 income from continuing operations before income taxes\nto 1.03 billion dlrs, the first time K Mart Corp has reached\nthis milestone.\"\n    Sales for the 1986 fiscal year reached a record 23.8\nbillion dlrs, an 8.1 pct rise from 22.04 billion dlrs the prior\nyear. K Mart said 1985 was restated to account for discontinued\noperations. Comparable store sales rose 5.5 pct in 1986 over\n1985, it said.\n    Fauber said the sales growth came from greater consumer\nacceptance of K Mart's apparel merchandise, \"a marked increase\nin hardline merchandise sales and a growing contribution from\nspecialty retailing operations.\"\n    K Mart said its fourth quarter pre-tax income from\ncontinuing operations was 493 mln dlrs, a 32.3 pct gain from\n372.6 mln dlrs last year. It said sales in the period grew 8.8\npct to 7.23 billion dlrs from a restated 6.65 billion dlrs in\n1985 with comparable store sales up 4.7 pct.\n    K Mart said its effective tax rate rose in 1986 to 44.6 pct\nfrom 37.6 pct in 1985. But it said selling, general and\nadministrative expense eased to 23.2 pct of sales from 23.7 pct\nin 1985.\n    \"Our performance in 1986 marks a major turning point for K\nMart,\" Fauber said in a statement.\n    \"In the years immediately prior to 1986, we focused on\nchanging the look of our stores and the structure of the\ncompany.\"\n    K Mart, he said, committed billion of dollars for store\nremodeling and installing a centralized point of sale system,\nupgraded its merchandise mix, acquired three large specialty\nretailers, divested underperforming businesses and restructured\nits long-term debt.\n    \"We were forced to pay a temporary price in the form of\nslower earnings growth and a lower rating by the investment\ncommunity. However, beginning with the fourth quarter of 1985,\nour improved performance is proof that our approach is correct\nfor the long term,\" the K Mart chairman said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
