        "BODY": "Attorney General Edwin Meese said he\nsaw some benefit in the proposed purchase of American Motors Co\n<AMO> By Chrysler Corp <C> in that it would return the smallest\nof the U.S. auto manufacturers to American hands.\n    Meese told the House Appropriations Subcommittee that\nconsideration would be part of the Justice Department's review\nof the proposed merger. He said the agency has not yet received\na formal notice of the merger which would start the review\nprocess.\n   Chrysler has made a 1.3 billion dlr bid to buy AMC from its\nFrench parent Renault.\n    \"I think one of the things that has to be recognized in that\nmerger is that it appears, at least, that a good portion of the\nownership of American Motors, which has been in overseas hands\nwill be put back in American hands,\" Meese told the\nsubcommittee.\n    \"That may be one of the factors that would be weighed in the\njudgment,\" he added.\n    Renault currently holds about 46 pct of AMC.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
