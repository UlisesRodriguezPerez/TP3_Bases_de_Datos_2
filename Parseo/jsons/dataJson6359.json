        "BODY": "The Bank of England said it had invited\nan early round of bill offers from the discount houses after\nforecasting a shortage in the system of around 1.1 billion stg.\n    Money market dealers speculated that the central bank could\nbe taking the opportunity to signal a reduction in U.K. Base\nlending rates by cutting the rates at which it intervenes in\nthe discount market.\n    Most operators are expecting a base rate cut today,\npossibly of one point, following yesterday's budget in which\nthe U.K. Public sector borrowing target for 1987/88 was slashed\nby three billion stg.\n    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing\nin official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain\nsome 1.11 billion stg while a rise in note circulation and\nbankers' balances below target will take out around 120 mln stg\nand 20 mln stg respectively.\n    Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions\nwill add some 140 mln stg to the system today.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
