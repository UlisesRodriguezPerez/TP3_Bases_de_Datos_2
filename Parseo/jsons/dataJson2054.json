        "BODY": "Mannesmann AG <MMWG.F>, the\ndiversified engineering and pipe-making group, is interested in\ntaking a stake in a U.S. Company or companies but has not yet\nfound a suitable firm, a spokesman said in reply to questions.\n    Mannesmann managing board chairman Werner Dieter told the\nbusiness weekly Wirtschaftswoche in an interview that\nMannesmann wanted to invest in a U.S. Company in order to\nstrengthen its presence on the U.S. Market.\n    Dieter said Mannesmann would act quickly when and if it\nfound a firm in which it wanted to take a stake.\n    The Mannesmann spokesman declined to say in which\nindustrial sector the group may make a U.S. Acquisition or how\nbig the acquisition might be.\n    He also said the group had not yet completed taking over a\nstake in car components firm <Fichtel und Sachs AG>.\n    Mannesmann had said in January it hoped to take a 37.5 pct\nstake in Fichtel und Sachs's holding company, Sachs AG, in the\nfirst quarter. The spokesman said Mannesmann had a letter of\nintent on the takeover from the heirs of the company's late\nowner but completion has been delayed by legal questions\nconcerning the inheritance.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
