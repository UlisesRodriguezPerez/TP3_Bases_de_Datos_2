        "BODY": "The Philippines will ask the U.S.\nAgriculture Department (USDA) to increase its 1987 sugar import\nquota following market reports that Taiwan will not be able to\nfulfil its quota, Sugar Regulation Administration (SRA)\nchairman Arsenim Yulo said.\n    Yulo told Reuters the SRA would also protest a USDA move to\naward Taiwan's shortfall to the Dominican Republic.\n    The Dominican Republic already has a larger sugar quota,\nYulo said. \"Any Taiwanese shortfall should be awarded to the\nPhilippines or at the least we should share a hike with the\nDominican Republic.\"\n    The USDA last December listed 1987 sugar import quota\nallocations for the Dominican Republic at 160,160 short tons\nand for Taiwan at 10,920 short tons.\n    The Philippines has said it was badly hit by a cut in its\nquota to 143,780 short tons from 231,660 in 1986.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
