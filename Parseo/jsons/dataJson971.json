        "BODY": "The Unilever Plc and NV <UN.A> group saw\nimproved performance in almost all sectors during 1986, the\nAnglo-Dutch group said in its results statement.\n    Very good progress was made last year, while the recent\nacquisition of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc <CBM.N> was a significant\naddition which will greatly benefit the group in the years to\ncome.\n    Earlier, Unilever reported combined fourth quarter pre-tax\nprofit of 276 mln stg, level with the year earlier period,\nmaking 1.14 billion stg compared with 953 mln for the 1986 full\nyear.\n    Unilever said it plans to change its depreciation policy to\nthe more conventional practice of depreciating assets\nindividually rather than depreciating fixed assets at average\nrates. The new method is expected to lead to a reduction in the\naccumulated provision for depreciation and thereby increase the\nnet book value of tangible asssets by about 300 mln stg as at\nJanuary 1, 1987.\n    Unilever Plc shares are up 25p since yesterday at 2,575p in\nbuoyant response to the results and share split proposal,\nthough 1986 profits were not ahead of market forecasts, dealers\nadded.\n REUTER\n\u0003"
