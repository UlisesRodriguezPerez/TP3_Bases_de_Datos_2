        "BODY": "A senior Abu Dhabi oil official said\nin remarks published today the emirate, largest producer in the\nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE), was succeeding in marketing its\ncrude oil without breaching OPEC accords.\n    Khalaf al-Oteiba, Marketing Director at the Abu Dhabi\nNational Oil Co (ADNOC), told the company's Petroleum Community\nmagazine ADNOC was also keen to keep good customer relations.\n\"The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its\ncustomers in accordance with market conditions...And take\nnecessary steps to guarantee marketing its production,\" he said.\n   \"The present oil marketing policy of ADNOC is based on\nadherence to OPEC decisions of December 1986 to control\nproduction and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to\nstabilize the market,\" he added.\n    OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mln\nbpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel.\n    Oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future\ndepended on how much discipline OPEC showed.\n    Oteiba said last year, when world oil prices dropped, was\nADNOC's most difficult ever but \"a practical and flexible\npricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market\nenvironment.\"\n    He said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average\n609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. Refined product sales\ntotalled eight mln metric tonnes, of which 67 pct was exported.\n    In 1985, ADNOC marketed a total of 476,000 bpd of crude oil\nand 7.2 mln tonnes of refined products.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
