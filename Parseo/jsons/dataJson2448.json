        "DATELINE": "    CHICAGO, March 5 - ",
        "BODY": "Delegates from the National Pork\nProducers Council, NPPC, attending the American Pork Congress\nin Indianapolis, voted overwhelmingly to recommend the U.S.\ncongress not to change the farm bill. While there are no\nspecific pork items in that legislation, feed grain prices\ndirectly affect pork producer profits, the NPPC said.\n    Don Gingerich, a delegate from Iowa, said \"to have\nunpredictable changes come along periodically makes it very\ndifficult to plan and causes a lot of disruption.\"\n    Other members said the farm bill has some imperfections but\nthat's a price pork producers are willing to pay for\nlegislative stability, an NPPC spokesman said.\n    Delegates also passed unanimously a resolution that\nCongress and the administration should act swiftly to identify\nproblems in the farm credit system.\n    Farm Credit Task Force chairman and newly elected Vice\nPresident of the NPPC Ray Hankes, said delegates wanted a\nprogram that all commodity groups can work with and bring a \nresolution to this problem with legislators in Washington.\n    Hankes added that the National Pork Producers Council will\nwork to save farmers and keep credit available, but not to save\nor create any one credit system.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003"
