        "DATELINE": "    ROME, March 26 - ",
        "BODY": "Extracts from a report by Italy's Budget\nMinistry on the country's economic development in 1986 showed\ngross domestic product (GDP) 2.7 pct higher in real terms than\nin 1985 but a rise in unemployment.\n    GDP calculated at 1980 prices rose to 434,682 billion lire\nlast year from 423,064 billion in 1985. On a current prices\nbasis, GDP was up 11 pct, totalling 894,362 billion lire in\n1986 against 805,754 billion in 1985.\n     But growth was insufficient to prevent a rise in\nunemployment to 11.1 pct last year from 10.3 pct in 1985, the\nministry said.\n    The report said falling oil prices and the depreciation of\nthe dollar during 1986 had favoured oil-importing countries\nsuch as Italy.\n    These factors helped Italy cut inflation to an average 6.3\npct in 1986, down from 9.3 pct in 1985.\n    They also helped a major improvement in the trade balance.\n    On the basis of data recently recalculated by the national\nstatistics institute Istat, Italy had a trade deficit in 1986\nof 3,722 billion lire, the report said. This slightly revises a\nprevious deficit figure of 3,717 billion issued by Istat and\ncompares with a negative balance of 23,085 billion for 1985.\n Reuter\n\u0003"
