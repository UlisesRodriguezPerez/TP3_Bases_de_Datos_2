        "BODY": "Britain's gold and currency reserves\nshowed an underlying rise of 287 mln dlrs in February, after a\n72 mln dlrs rise in January, the Treasury said.\n    The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England\noperations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of\nborrowings and repayments.\n    This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise.\n    The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunity\nof strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn\nand said the underlying rise was still relatively modest.\n    Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22.26\nbillion dlrs, after rising 29 mln in January to 21.95 billion.\n    Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were\n36 mln dlrs last month, after 163 mln in January, while\nrepayments were 16 mln dlrs after the previous 151 mln, a\nTreasury spokesman said.\n    Capital repayments totalled two mln dlrs. In January,\ncapital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs, with a valuation\nchange that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to the\nquarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fund\nswap.\n    The Treasury would not comment on the Bank of England's\nmarket operations, but currency traders reported moderate Bank\nof England intervention to curb upward pressure on the pound\ntoday.\n    A Treasury spokesman, commenting on the reserves figures,\nsaid that the government does not want sterling either to rise\ntoo far or to fall substantially from current levels.\n    He noted that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson\nstressed this after the recent Paris currencies meeting.\n    REUTER\n\u0003"
